Sense & Sensibility,0,SENSE AND SENSIBILITYby Jane Austen(1811)
Sense & Sensibility,1,"CHAPTER 1The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estatewas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre oftheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in sorespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of theirsurrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a singleman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of hislife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But herdeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a greatalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and receivedinto his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legalinheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended tobequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and theirchildren, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent.  Hisattachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. andMrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely frominterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solidcomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of thechildren added a relish to his existence.By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his presentlady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, wasamply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his ownmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to hiswealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was notso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independentof what might arise to them from their father's inheriting thatproperty, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and theirfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for theremaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to herchild, and he had only a life-interest in it.The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every otherwill, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither sounjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--buthe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of thebequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wifeand daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and hisson's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, asto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dearto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, orby any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for thebenefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father andmother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, bysuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or threeyears old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having hisown way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweighall the value of all the attention which, for years, he had receivedfrom his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them athousand pounds a-piece.Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper wascheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produceof an estate already large, and capable of almost immediateimprovement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, washis only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer; and tenthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained forhis widow and daughters.His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illnesscould command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of thefamily; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature atsuch a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to makethem comfortable.  His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there mightprudently be in his power to do for them.He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold heartedand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, wellrespected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge ofhis ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman, he mighthave been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even havebeen made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, andvery fond of his wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricatureof himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself toincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousandpounds a-piece.  He then really thought himself equal to it.  Theprospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed hisheart, and made him feel capable of generosity.-- ""Yes, he would givethem three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It wouldbe enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! hecould spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.""-- Hethought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he didnot repent.No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,arrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute herright to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of hisfather's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much thegreater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only commonfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there wasa sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence ofthe kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source ofimmovable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite withany of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till thepresent, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort ofother people she could act when occasion required it.So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and soearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on thearrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, hadnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on thepropriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three childrendetermined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breachwith their brother.Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possesseda strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualifiedher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, andenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have ledto imprudence.  She had an excellent heart;--her disposition wasaffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to governthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and whichone of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's.She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, herjoys, could have no moderation.  She was generous, amiable,interesting: she was everything but prudent.  The resemblance betweenher and her mother was strikingly great.Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; butby Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.  They encouraged eachother now in the violence of their affliction.  The agony of griefwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was soughtfor, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly totheir sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection thatcould afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation infuture.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she couldstruggle, she could exert herself.  She could consult with her brother,could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her withproper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similarexertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; butas she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, withouthaving much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equalher sisters at a more advanced period of life."
Sense & Sensibility,2,"CHAPTER 2Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and hermother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and byher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybodybeyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really pressed them,with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as noplan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till shecould accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, hisinvitation was accepted.A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of formerdelight, was exactly what suited her mind.  In seasons of cheerfulness,no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greaterdegree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happinessitself.  But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intendedto do for his sisters.  To take three thousand pounds from the fortuneof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the mostdreadful degree.  She begged him to think again on the subject.  Howcould he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,of so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as norelationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.  Itwas very well known that no affection was ever supposed to existbetween the children of any man by different marriages; and why was heto ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all hismoney to his half sisters?""It was my father's last request to me,"" replied her husband, ""that Ishould assist his widow and daughters.""""He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but hewas light-headed at the time.  Had he been in his right senses, hecould not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away halfyour fortune from your own child.""""He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he onlyrequested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make theirsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps itwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He couldhardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the promise,I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Somethingmust be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a newhome.""""Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something neednot be three thousand pounds.  Consider,"" she added, ""that when themoney is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters willmarry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restoredto our poor little boy--""""Why, to be sure,"" said her husband, very gravely, ""that would makegreat difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that solarge a sum was parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, forinstance, it would be a very convenient addition.""""To be sure it would.""""Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum werediminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigiousincrease to their fortunes!""""Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half somuch for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!  And as it is--onlyhalf blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!""""I would not wish to do any thing mean,"" he replied.  ""One had rather,on such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, canthink I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardlyexpect more.""""There is no knowing what THEY may expect,"" said the lady, ""but we arenot to think of their expectations: the question is, what you canafford to do.""""Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five hundred poundsa-piece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each haveabout three thousand pounds on their mother's death--a very comfortablefortune for any young woman.""""To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want noaddition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongstthem.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they donot, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of tenthousand pounds.""""That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon thewhole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their motherwhile she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind Imean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.""His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to thisplan.""To be sure,"" said she, ""it is better than parting with fifteen hundredpounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen yearswe shall be completely taken in.""""Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half thatpurchase.""""Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever whenthere is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes overand over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are notaware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the troubleof annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three toold superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing howdisagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to bepaid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and thenone of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to beno such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not herown, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the moreunkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have beenentirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.  Ithas given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I wouldnot pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.""""It is certainly an unpleasant thing,"" replied Mr. Dashwood, ""to havethose kind of yearly drains on one's income.  One's fortune, as yourmother justly says, is NOT one's own.  To be tied down to the regularpayment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: ittakes away one's independence.""""Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They thinkthemselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raisesno gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done atmy own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare ahundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.""""I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there shouldbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally willbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because theywould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a largerincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of theyear.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fiftypounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed formoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.""""To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced withinmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money atall.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as mightbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for acomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever theyare in season.  I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.  Do but consider,my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-lawand her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, whichbrings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they willpay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will havefive hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women wantfor more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping willbe nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardlyany servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses ofany kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred ayear! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and asto your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They willbe much more able to give YOU something.""""Upon my word,"" said Mr. Dashwood, ""I believe you are perfectly right.My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me thanwhat you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfilmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as youhave described.  When my mother removes into another house my servicesshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some littlepresent of furniture too may be acceptable then.""""Certainly,"" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  ""But, however, ONE thingmust be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, andlinen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house willtherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.""""That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacyindeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasantaddition to our own stock here.""""Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as whatbelongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, forany place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe noparticular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we verywell know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in theworld to THEM.""This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever ofdecision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would beabsolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for thewidow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts ashis own wife pointed out."
Sense & Sensibility,3,"CHAPTER 3Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from anydisinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceasedto raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for whenher spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some otherexertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholyremembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in herinquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; forto remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.  But she couldhear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort andease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadierjudgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, whichher mother would have approved.Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise onthe part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his lastearthly reflections.  She doubted the sincerity of this assurance nomore than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for herdaughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she waspersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her inaffluence.  For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his ownheart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to hismerit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentivebehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfarewas dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on theliberality of his intentions.The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt forher daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledgeof her character, which half a year's residence in her family afforded;and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternalaffection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found itimpossible to have lived together so long, had not a particularcircumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according tothe opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl andthe brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing youngman, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister'sestablishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part ofhis time there.Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives ofinterest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had diedvery rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on thewill of his mother.  But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by eitherconsideration.  It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortuneshould keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance ofdisposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged byevery one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by anypeculiar graces of person or address.  He was not handsome, and hismanners required intimacy to make them pleasing.  He was too diffidentto do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.His understanding was good, and his education had given it solidimprovement.  But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition toanswer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see himdistinguished--as--they hardly knew what.  They wanted him to make afine figure in the world in some manner or other.  His mother wished tointerest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or tosee him connected with some of the great men of the day.  Mrs. JohnDashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of thesesuperior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted herambition to see him driving a barouche.  But Edward had no turn forgreat men or barouches.  All his wishes centered in domestic comfortand the quiet of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brotherwho was more promising.Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engagedmuch of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in suchaffliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.  She sawonly that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.  Hedid not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by areflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the differencebetween him and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended himmost forcibly to her mother.""It is enough,"" said she; ""to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.It implies everything amiable.  I love him already.""""I think you will like him,"" said Elinor, ""when you know more of him.""""Like him!"" replied her mother with a smile.  ""I feel no sentiment ofapprobation inferior to love.""""You may esteem him.""""I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.""Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.  Her mannerswere attaching, and soon banished his reserve.  She speedilycomprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinorperhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of hisworth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against allher established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was nolonger uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temperaffectionate.No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour toElinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, andlooked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.""In a few months, my dear Marianne."" said she, ""Elinor will, in allprobability be settled for life.  We shall miss her; but SHE will behappy.""""Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?""""My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall live within a fewmiles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.  You willgain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highestopinion in the world of Edward's heart.  But you look grave, Marianne;do you disapprove your sister's choice?""""Perhaps,"" said Marianne, ""I may consider it with some surprise.Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.  But yet--he is notthe kind of young man--there is something wanting--his figure is notstriking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the manwho could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes want all that spirit,that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besidesall this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.  Music seemsscarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings verymuch, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand theirworth.  It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her whileshe draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires asa lover, not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters must beunited.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in everypoint coincide with my own.  He must enter into all my feelings; thesame books, the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, howspiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it with so muchcomposure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep myseat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almostdriven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, suchdreadful indifference!""""He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper.""""Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allowfor difference of taste.  Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore shemay overlook it, and be happy with him.  But it would have broke MYheart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that Ishall never see a man whom I can really love.  I require so much!  Hemust have all Edward's virtues, and his person and manners mustornament his goodness with every possible charm.""""Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.  It is yet too early inlife to despair of such a happiness.  Why should you be less fortunatethan your mother?  In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may yourdestiny be different from hers!"""
Sense & Sensibility,4,"CHAPTER 4""What a pity it is, Elinor,"" said Marianne, ""that Edward should have notaste for drawing.""""No taste for drawing!"" replied Elinor, ""why should you think so? Hedoes not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing theperformances of other people, and I assure you he is by no meansdeficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities ofimproving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think hewould have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment in suchmatters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on anypicture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, whichin general direct him perfectly right.""Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; butthe kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by thedrawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, thoughsmiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for thatblind partiality to Edward which produced it.""I hope, Marianne,"" continued Elinor, ""you do not consider him asdeficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were youropinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him.""Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would not wound the feelings ofher sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe wasimpossible.  At length she replied:""Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thingequal to your sense of his merits.  I have not had so manyopportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, hisinclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion inthe world of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that isworthy and amiable.""""I am sure,"" replied Elinor, with a smile, ""that his dearest friendscould not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that.  I do notperceive how you could express yourself more warmly.""Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.""Of his sense and his goodness,"" continued Elinor, ""no one can, Ithink, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him inunreserved conversation.  The excellence of his understanding and hisprinciples can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keepshim silent.  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have frompeculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and Ihave been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have beenwholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  Ihave seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heardhis opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, Iventure to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of booksexceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just andcorrect, and his taste delicate and pure.  His abilities in everyrespect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his personcan hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, whichare uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, isperceived.  At present, I know him so well, that I think him reallyhandsome; or at least, almost so.  What say you, Marianne?""""I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now.  Whenyou tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfectionin his face, than I now do in his heart.""Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth shehad been betrayed into, in speaking of him.  She felt that Edward stoodvery high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual; butshe required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction oftheir attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that what Marianne and hermother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explainthe real state of the case to her sister.""I do not attempt to deny,"" said she, ""that I think very highly ofhim--that I greatly esteem, that I like him.""Marianne here burst forth with indignation--""Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh!  worse thancold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and Iwill leave the room this moment.""Elinor could not help laughing.  ""Excuse me,"" said she; ""and be assuredthat I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of myown feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--thehope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.But farther than this you must not believe.  I am by no means assuredof his regard for me.  There are moments when the extent of it seemsdoubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder atmy wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, bybelieving or calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feellittle--scarcely any doubt of his preference.  But there are otherpoints to be considered besides his inclination.  He is very far frombeing independent.  What his mother really is we cannot know; but, fromFanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have neverbeen disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken ifEdward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties inhis way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a greatfortune or high rank.""Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her motherand herself had outstripped the truth.""And you really are not engaged to him!"" said she.  ""Yet it certainlysoon will happen.  But two advantages will proceed from this delay.  Ishall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity ofimproving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must beso indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he shouldbe so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, howdelightful it would be!""Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.  She could notconsider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Mariannehad believed it.  There was, at times, a want of spirits about himwhich, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost asunpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need notgive him more than inquietude.  It would not be likely to produce thatdejection of mind which frequently attended him.  A more reasonablecause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade theindulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother neither behavedto him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give himany assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictlyattending to her views for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledgeas this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.  Shewas far from depending on that result of his preference of her, whichher mother and sister still considered as certain.  Nay, the longerthey were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard;and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no morethan friendship.But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceivedby his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which wasstill more common,) to make her uncivil.  She took the firstopportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking toher so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs.Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of thedanger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; thatMrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor tobe calm.  She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, andinstantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be theinconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinorshould not be exposed another week to such insinuations.In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from thepost, which contained a proposal particularly well timed.  It was theoffer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation ofher own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.  Theletter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spiritof friendly accommodation.  He understood that she was in need of adwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,he assured her that everything should be done to it which she mightthink necessary, if the situation pleased her.  He earnestly pressedher, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come withher daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, fromwhence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houseswere in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortableto her.  He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole ofhis letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail ofgiving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she wassuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearerconnections.  She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.  Herresolution was formed as she read.  The situation of Barton, in acounty so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hoursbefore, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh everypossible advantage belonging to the place, was now its firstrecommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer anevil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison ofthe misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove forever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit orvisit it while such a woman was its mistress.  She instantly wrote SirJohn Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptanceof his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to herdaughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before heranswer were sent.Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settleat some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their presentacquaintance.  On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to opposeher mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.  The house, too, asdescribed by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent souncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on eitherpoint; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charmto her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norlandbeyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother fromsending a letter of acquiescence."
Sense & Sensibility,5,"CHAPTER 5No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herselfin the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that shewas provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than tillevery thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her withsurprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hopedthat she would not be settled far from Norland. She had greatsatisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edwardturned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surpriseand concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,""Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And towhat part of it?"" She explained the situation. It was within four milesnorthward of Exeter.""It is but a cottage,"" she continued, ""but I hope to see many of myfriends in it.  A room or two can easily be added; and if my friendsfind no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I willfind none in accommodating them.""She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwoodto visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greateraffection.  Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law hadmade her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than wasunavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in thatpoint to which it principally tended.  To separate Edward and Elinorwas as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs.John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totallyshe disregarded her disapprobation of the match.Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorryhe was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as toprevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture.  Hereally felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the veryexertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to hisfather was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniturewas all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen,plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could nothelp feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be sotrifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsomearticle of furniture.Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,and she might have immediate possession.  No difficulty arose on eitherside in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of hereffects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before sheset off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in theperformance of everything that interested her, was soon done.--Thehorses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after hisdeath, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldestdaughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only herown wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinorprevailed.  HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants tothree; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided fromamongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as LadyMiddleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred goingdirectly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and sherelied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as tofeel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution bythe evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of herremoval; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealedunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.  Now was thetime when her son-in-law's promise to his father might with particularpropriety be fulfilled.  Since he had neglected to do it on firstcoming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on asthe most suitable period for its accomplishment.  But Mrs. Dashwoodbegan shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced,from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extendedno farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.  He sofrequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and ofthe perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence inthe world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather tostand in need of more money himself than to have any design of givingmoney away.In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton'sfirst letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their futureabode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin theirjourney.Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place somuch beloved.  ""Dear, dear Norland!"" said Marianne, as she wanderedalone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; ""whenshall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from thisspot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, yewell-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decaybecause we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although wecan observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconsciousof the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of anychange in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain toenjoy you?"""
Sense & Sensibility,6,"CHAPTER 6The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy adisposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.  But as theydrew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of acountry which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a viewof Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.  It was apleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.  After windingalong it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.  A smallgreen court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicketgate admitted them into it.As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, theroof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor werethe walls covered with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directlythrough the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the entrancewas a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were theoffices and the stairs.  Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the restof the house.  It had not been built many years and was in good repair.In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tearswhich recollection called forth as they entered the house were soondried away.  They were cheered by the joy of the servants on theirarrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from firstseeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received animpression in its favour which was of material service in recommendingit to their lasting approbation.The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediatelybehind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were opendowns, the others cultivated and woody.  The village of Barton waschiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from thecottage windows.  The prospect in front was more extensive; itcommanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in thatdirection; under another name, and in another course, it branched outagain between two of the steepest of them.With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon thewhole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered manyadditions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was adelight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supplyall that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.  ""As for thehouse itself, to be sure,"" said she, ""it is too small for our family,but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as itis too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring, if Ihave plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think aboutbuilding.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of ourfriends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughtsof throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of theother, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamberand garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.  I couldwish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing;though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  Ishall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, andwe will plan our improvements accordingly.""In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from thesavings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never savedin her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as itwas; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, toform themselves a home.  Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked andproperly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the wallsof their sitting room.In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfastthe next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcomethem to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his ownhouse and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.  SirJohn Middleton was a good looking man about forty.  He had formerlyvisited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins toremember him.  His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and hismanners were as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrivalseemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be anobject of real solicitude to him.  He said much of his earnest desireof their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressedthem so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they werebetter settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to apoint of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence.His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after heleft them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived fromthe park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present ofgame.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to andfrom the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction ofsending them his newspaper every day.Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting herintention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assuredthat her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message wasanswered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introducedto them the next day.They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much oftheir comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearancewas favourable to their wishes.  Lady Middleton was not more than sixor seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall andstriking, and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegancewhich her husband's wanted.  But they would have been improved by someshare of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough todetract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, thoughperfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say forherself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, andLady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her theireldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which meansthere was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case ofextremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hungabout her and held down his head, to the great surprise of herladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he couldmake noise enough at home.  On every formal visit a child ought to beof the party, by way of provision for discourse.  In the present caseit took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like hisfather or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for ofcourse every body differed, and every body was astonished at theopinion of the others.An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on therest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house withoutsecuring their promise of dining at the park the next day."
Sense & Sensibility,7,"CHAPTER 7Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.  The ladies hadpassed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened fromtheir view at home by the projection of a hill.  The house was largeand handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitalityand elegance.  The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latterfor that of his lady.  They were scarcely ever without some friendsstaying with them in the house, and they kept more company of everykind than any other family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary tothe happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outwardbehaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want oftalent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected withsuch as society produced, within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was asportsman, Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and shehumoured her children; and these were their only resources.  LadyMiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all theyear round, while Sir John's independent employments were in existenceonly half the time.  Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported thegood spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of hiswife.Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and ofall her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was hergreatest enjoyment in any of their parties.  But Sir John'ssatisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collectingabout him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisierthey were the better was he pleased.  He was a blessing to all thejuvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for everforming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winterhis private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was notsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joyto him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitantshe had now procured for his cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods wereyoung, pretty, and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his goodopinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want tomake her mind as captivating as her person.  The friendliness of hisdisposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situationmight be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  Inshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfactionof a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in hiscottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman,though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, isnot often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to aresidence within his own manor.Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house bySir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity;and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the youngladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the daybefore, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.  Theywould see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; aparticular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither veryyoung nor very gay.  He hoped they would all excuse the smallness ofthe party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.  Hehad been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring someaddition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was fullof engagements.  Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Bartonwithin the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they mightimagine.  The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectlysatisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished forno more.Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry,fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, andrather vulgar.  She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinnerwas over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers andhusbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.  Marianne wasvexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinorto see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gaveElinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place railleryas Mrs. Jennings's.Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted byresemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to behis wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother.  He wassilent and grave.  His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spiteof his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute oldbachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but thoughhis face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and hisaddress was particularly gentlemanlike.There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them ascompanions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middletonwas so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity ofColonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and hismother-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed to be roused toenjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind ofdiscourse except what related to themselves.In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she wasinvited to play.  The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared tobe charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request wentthrough the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought intothe family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since inthe same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebratedthat event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, shehad played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.Marianne's performance was highly applauded.  Sir John was loud in hisadmiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversationwith the others while every song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequentlycalled him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be divertedfrom music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular songwhich Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone, of all theparty, heard her without being in raptures.  He paid her only thecompliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on theoccasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shamelesswant of taste.  His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to thatecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, wasestimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of theothers; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five andthirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and everyexquisite power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make everyallowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanityrequired."
Sense & Sensibility,8,"CHAPTER 8Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.  She had only twodaughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, andshe had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of theworld.  In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, asfar as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projectingweddings among all the young people of her acquaintance.  She wasremarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed theadvantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady byinsinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind ofdiscernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively topronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with MarianneDashwood.  She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first eveningof their being together, from his listening so attentively while shesang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons' diningat the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.It must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.  It would be anexcellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome.  Mrs. Jenningshad been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since herconnection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and shewas always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, forit supplied her with endless jokes against them both.  At the park shelaughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the formerher raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at firstincomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knewwhether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel'sadvanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger thanherself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy ofher daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability ofwishing to throw ridicule on his age.""But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured.  Colonel Brandonis certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MYfather; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must havelong outlived every sensation of the kind.  It is too ridiculous!  Whenis a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will notprotect him?""""Infirmity!"" said Elinor, ""do you call Colonel Brandon infirm?  I caneasily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to mymother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use ofhis limbs!""""Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?  and is not that thecommonest infirmity of declining life?""""My dearest child,"" said her mother, laughing, ""at this rate you mustbe in continual terror of MY decay; and it must seem to you a miraclethat my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty.""""Mama, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well that ColonelBrandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive oflosing him in the course of nature.  He may live twenty years longer.But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony.""""Perhaps,"" said Elinor, ""thirty-five and seventeen had better not haveany thing to do with matrimony together.  But if there should by anychance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I shouldnot think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to hismarrying HER.""""A woman of seven and twenty,"" said Marianne, after pausing a moment,""can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home beuncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bringherself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of theprovision and security of a wife.  In his marrying such a womantherefore there would be nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact ofconvenience, and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would beno marriage at all, but that would be nothing.  To me it would seemonly a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at theexpense of the other.""""It would be impossible, I know,"" replied Elinor, ""to convince you thata woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-fiveanything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to theconstant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced tocomplain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel inone of his shoulders.""""But he talked of flannel waistcoats,"" said Marianne; ""and with me aflannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old andthe feeble.""""Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised himhalf so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting toyou in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?""Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, ""Mama,"" saidMarianne, ""I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannotconceal from you.  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have nowbeen here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing butreal indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.  What elsecan detain him at Norland?""""Had you any idea of his coming so soon?"" said Mrs. Dashwood.  ""I hadnone.  On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on thesubject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want ofpleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of hiscoming to Barton.  Does Elinor expect him already?""""I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.""""I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to heryesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observedthat there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that theroom would be wanted for some time.""""How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!  But the whole oftheir behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, howcomposed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation thelast evening of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was nodistinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of anaffectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave them purposelytogether in the course of the last morning, and each time did he mostunaccountably follow me out of the room.  And Elinor, in quittingNorland and Edward, cried not as I did.  Even now her self-command isinvariable.  When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try toavoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"""
Sense & Sensibility,9,"CHAPTER 9The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort tothemselves.  The house and the garden, with all the objects surroundingthem, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which hadgiven to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greaterenjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of theirfather.  Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the firstfortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation athome, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, inspite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in theneighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always attheir service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame thewish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining tovisit any family beyond the distance of a walk.  There were but few whocould be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow windingvalley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerlydescribed, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered anancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a littleof Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to bebetter acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry, that itspossessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunatelytoo infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.  The highdowns which invited them from almost every window of the cottage toseek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happyalternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superiorbeauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret onememorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshineof a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which thesettled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned.  The weather wasnot tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and theirbook, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would belastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn offfrom their hills; and the two girls set off together.They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration atevery glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces theanimating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fearswhich had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing suchdelightful sensations.""Is there a felicity in the world,"" said Marianne, ""superior tothis?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.""Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resistingit with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenlythe clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full intheir face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, thoughunwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their ownhouse.  One consolation however remained for them, to which theexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that ofrunning with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill whichled immediately to their garden gate.They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false stepbrought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stopherself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached thebottom in safety.A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, waspassing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when heraccident happened.  He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  Shehad raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted inher fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.  The gentleman offeredhis services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what hersituation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without fartherdelay, and carried her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directlyinto the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not hishold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and whilethe eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secretadmiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized forhis intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and sograceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, receivedadditional charms from his voice and expression.  Had he been even old,ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood wouldhave been secured by any act of attention to her child; but theinfluence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to theaction which came home to her feelings.She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address whichalways attended her, invited him to be seated.  But this he declined,as he was dirty and wet.  Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom shewas obliged.  His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his presenthome was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him thehonour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.  The honourwas readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still moreinteresting, in the midst of a heavy rain.His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly thetheme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raisedagainst Marianne received particular spirit from his exteriorattractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama therest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his liftingher up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after theirentering the house.  But she had seen enough of him to join in all theadmiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned herpraise.  His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawnfor the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into thehouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity ofthought which particularly recommended the action to her.  Everycircumstance belonging to him was interesting.  His name was good, hisresidence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out thatof all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.  Herimagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of asprained ankle was disregarded.Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weatherthat morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accidentbeing related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew anygentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.""Willoughby!"" cried Sir John; ""what, is HE in the country? That is goodnews however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner onThursday.""""You know him then,"" said Mrs. Dashwood.""Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here every year.""""And what sort of a young man is he?""""As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decentshot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.""""And is that all you can say for him?"" cried Marianne, indignantly.""But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What hispursuits, his talents, and genius?""Sir John was rather puzzled.""Upon my soul,"" said he, ""I do not know much about him as to all THAT.But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicestlittle black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she out with himtoday?""But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of hismind.""But who is he?"" said Elinor.  ""Where does he come from?  Has he ahouse at Allenham?""On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and hetold them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in thecountry; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old ladyat Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he wasto inherit; adding, ""Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I cantell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own inSomersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to myyounger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  MissMarianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon willbe jealous, if she does not take care.""""I do not believe,"" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,""that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MYdaughters towards what you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employmentto which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, letthem be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say,that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will notbe ineligible.""""He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,"" repeatedSir John.  ""I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, hedanced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down.""""Did he indeed?"" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, ""and withelegance, with spirit?""""Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.""""That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be.  Whateverbe his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, andleave him no sense of fatigue.""""Aye, aye, I see how it will be,"" said Sir John, ""I see how it will be.You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poorBrandon.""""That is an expression, Sir John,"" said Marianne, warmly, ""which Iparticularly dislike.  I abhor every common-place phrase by which witis intended; and 'setting one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,'are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; andif their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long agodestroyed all its ingenuity.""Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed asheartily as if he did, and then replied,""Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worthsetting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumblingabout and spraining of ankles."""
Sense & Sensibility,10,"CHAPTER 10Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to makehis personal enquiries.  He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with morethan politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him andher own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during thevisit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introducedhim.  Of their personal charms he had not required a second interviewto be convinced.Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and aremarkably pretty figure.  Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form,though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage ofheight, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in thecommon cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was lessviolently outraged than usually happens.  Her skin was very brown, but,from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; herfeatures were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in hereyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,which could hardily be seen without delight.  From Willoughby theirexpression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which theremembrance of his assistance created.  But when this passed away, whenher spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfectgood-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, andabove all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he waspassionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as securedthe largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage herto talk.  She could not be silent when such points were introduced, andshe had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.  They speedilydiscovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, andthat it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that relatedto either.  Encouraged by this to a further examination of hisopinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; herfavourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturousa delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have beeninsensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellenceof such works, however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikinglyalike.  The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or ifany difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer thantill the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could bedisplayed.  He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all herenthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed withthe familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.""Well, Marianne,"" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, ""for ONEmorning I think you have done pretty well.  You have alreadyascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter ofimportance.  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you arecertain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you havereceived every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under suchextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soonhave exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice toexplain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, andthen you can have nothing farther to ask.""--""Elinor,"" cried Marianne, ""is this fair? is this just? are my ideas soscanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, toohappy, too frank.  I have erred against every common-place notion ofdecorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have beenreserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of theweather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, thisreproach would have been spared.""""My love,"" said her mother, ""you must not be offended with Elinor--shewas only in jest.  I should scold her myself, if she were capable ofwishing to check the delight of your conversation with our newfriend.""-- Marianne was softened in a moment.Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in theiracquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  Hecame to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first hisexcuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gavegreater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceasedto be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.  She was confined forsome days to the house; but never had any confinement been lessirksome.  Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quickimagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He wasexactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joinednot only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which wasnow roused and increased by the example of her own, and whichrecommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.  They read,they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable;and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward hadunfortunately wanted.In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's; andElinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which hestrongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying toomuch what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons orcircumstances.  In hastily forming and giving his opinion of otherpeople, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undividedattention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily theforms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinorcould not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say inits support.Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seizedher at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy herideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby wasall that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in everybrighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviourdeclared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilitieswere strong.Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of theirmarriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before theend of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulateherself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early beendiscovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, whenit ceased to be noticed by them.  Their attention and wit were drawnoff to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other hadincurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelingsbegan really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentimentswhich Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were nowactually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblanceof disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was nohindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to avery lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish himsuccessful, she heartily wished him indifferent.  She liked him--inspite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object ofinterest.  His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserveappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of anynatural gloominess of temper.  Sir John had dropped hints of pastinjuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his beingan unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted byWilloughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neitherlively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.""Brandon is just the kind of man,"" said Willoughby one day, when theywere talking of him together, ""whom every body speaks well of, andnobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembersto talk to.""""That is exactly what I think of him,"" cried Marianne.""Do not boast of it, however,"" said Elinor, ""for it is injustice inboth of you.  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, andI never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.""""That he is patronised by YOU,"" replied Willoughby, ""is certainly inhis favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach initself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such awoman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command theindifference of any body else?""""But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne willmake amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother.  If theirpraise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not moreundiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.""""In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.""""My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will alwayshave attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirtyand forty.  He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, hasread, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him capable of giving memuch information on various subjects; and he has always answered myinquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.""""That is to say,"" cried Marianne contemptuously, ""he has told you, thatin the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes aretroublesome.""""He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries,but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.""""Perhaps,"" said Willoughby, ""his observations may have extended to theexistence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.""""I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much furtherthan your candour.  But why should you dislike him?""""I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary, as a veryrespectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice;who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how toemploy, and two new coats every year.""""Add to which,"" cried Marianne, ""that he has neither genius, taste, norspirit.  That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings noardour, and his voice no expression.""""You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,"" replied Elinor,""and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that thecommendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold andinsipid.  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiableheart.""""Miss Dashwood,"" cried Willoughby, ""you are now using me unkindly.  Youare endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against mywill.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can beartful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking ColonelBrandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he hasfound fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade himto buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respectsirreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for anacknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me theprivilege of disliking him as much as ever."""
Sense & Sensibility,11,"CHAPTER 11Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first cameinto Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy theirtime as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have suchfrequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them littleleisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.  When Mariannewas recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which SirJohn had been previously forming, were put into execution.  The privateballs at the park then began; and parties on the water were made andaccomplished as often as a showery October would allow.  In everymeeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease andfamiliarity which naturally attended these parties were exactlycalculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with theDashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies ofMarianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of heraffection.Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She only wishedthat it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture tosuggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne.  But Marianneabhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselvesillaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but adisgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was anillustration of their opinions.When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.  Every thing hedid, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.  If their evenings atthe park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the restof the party to get her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusementof the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged toseparate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together andscarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them ofcourse most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, andseemed hardly to provoke them.Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which lefther no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To herit was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young andardent mind.This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her heart was devoted toWilloughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought withher from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought itpossible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on herpresent home.Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much atease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They affordedher no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret thanever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her theconversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker,and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her alarge share of her discourse.  She had already repeated her own historyto Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal toher means of improvement, she might have known very early in theiracquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, andwhat he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middletonwas more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.  Elinorneeded little observation to perceive that her reserve was a merecalmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.  Towards herhusband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy wastherefore neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing to sayone day that she had not said the day before.  Her insipidity wasinvariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though shedid not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided everything were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her,she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she mighthave experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her presenceadd to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by hersolicitude about her troublesome boys.In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor finda person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excitethe interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, evenher sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; hisattentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man mighthave been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately forhimself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and inconversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for theindifference of her sister.Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspectthat the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped fromhim one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together bymutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed onMarianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faintsmile, ""Your sister, I understand, does not approve of secondattachments.""""No,"" replied Elinor, ""her opinions are all romantic.""""Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.""""I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting onthe character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis ofcommon sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to defineand to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.""""This will probably be the case,"" he replied; ""and yet there issomething so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one issorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.""""I cannot agree with you there,"" said Elinor.  ""There areinconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all thecharms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Hersystems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety atnought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forwardto as her greatest possible advantage.""After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,--""Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against asecond attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are thosewho have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from theinconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to beequally indifferent during the rest of their lives?""""Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a secondattachment's being pardonable.""""This,"" said he, ""cannot hold; but a change, a total change ofsentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinementsof a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are theysucceeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  Ispeak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mindgreatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but whofrom an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances""--Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might nototherwise have entered Elinor's head.  The lady would probably havepassed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that whatconcerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required buta slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tenderrecollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story wouldhave been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thingestablished in the most melancholy order of disastrous love."
Sense & Sensibility,12,"CHAPTER 12As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning thelatter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite ofall that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her,with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, onethat he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which wasexactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering that it wasnot in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alterher resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for theservant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stableto receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, andtold her sister of it in raptures.""He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,""she added, ""and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shallshare its use with me.  Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, thedelight of a gallop on some of these downs.""Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity tocomprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and forsome time she refused to submit to them.  As to an additional servant,the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object toit; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at thepark; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.  Elinor thenventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from aman so little, or at least so lately known to her.  This was too much.""You are mistaken, Elinor,"" said she warmly, ""in supposing I know verylittle of Willoughby.  I have not known him long indeed, but I am muchbetter acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in theworld, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that isto determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone.  Seven years would beinsufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and sevendays are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty ofgreater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than fromWilloughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived togetherfor years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed.""Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.  She knew hersister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a subject would only attachher the more to her own opinion.  But by an appeal to her affection forher mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgentmother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) sheconsented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortlysubdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudentkindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she sawhim next, that it must be declined.She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at thecottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment tohim in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of hispresent.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same timerelated, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his sideimpossible.  His concern however was very apparent; and afterexpressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,--""But,Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  Ishall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton toform your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shallreceive you.""This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of thesentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing hersister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy sodecided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement betweenthem.  From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to eachother; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, orany of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discoverit by accident.Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed thismatter in a still clearer light.  Willoughby had spent the precedingevening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlourwith only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldestsister, when they were next by themselves.""Oh, Elinor!"" she cried, ""I have such a secret to tell you aboutMarianne.  I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon.""""You have said so,"" replied Elinor, ""almost every day since they firstmet on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, Ibelieve, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture roundher neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our greatuncle.""""But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will bemarried very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.""""Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair of some great uncle ofHIS.""""But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for Isaw him cut it off.  Last night after tea, when you and mama went outof the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as couldbe, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he tookup her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was alltumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece ofwhite paper; and put it into his pocket-book.""For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could notwithhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstancewas in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactoryto her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at thepark, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particularfavourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, ""I must nottell, may I, Elinor?""This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.But the effort was painful.  She was convinced that Margaret had fixedon a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become astanding joke with Mrs. Jennings.Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than goodto the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner toMargaret,""Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right torepeat them.""""I never had any conjectures about it,"" replied Margaret; ""it was youwho told me of it yourself.""This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerlypressed to say something more.""Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,"" said Mrs.Jennings.  ""What is the gentleman's name?""""I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what it is; and I knowwhere he is too.""""Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to besure.  He is the curate of the parish I dare say.""""No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all.""""Margaret,"" said Marianne with great warmth, ""you know that all this isan invention of your own, and that there is no such person inexistence.""""Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was sucha man once, and his name begins with an F.""Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at thismoment, ""that it rained very hard,"" though she believed theinterruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from herladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery asdelighted her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her, wasimmediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasionmindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject ofrain by both of them.  Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and askedMarianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours ofdifferent people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.  But not soeasily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see avery fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to abrother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could notbe seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orderson that head.  The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, andSir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowedto be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, atleast, twice every summer for the last ten years.  They contained anoble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of themorning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriagesonly to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of acomplete party of pleasure.To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for thelast fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, waspersuaded by Elinor to stay at home."
Sense & Sensibility,13,"CHAPTER 13Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different fromwhat Elinor had expected.  She was prepared to be wet through,fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, forthey did not go at all.By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where theywere to breakfast.  The morning was rather favourable, though it hadrained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high spirits andgood humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to thegreatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.  Among therest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it, looked at thedirection, changed colour, and immediately left the room.""What is the matter with Brandon?"" said Sir John.Nobody could tell.""I hope he has had no bad news,"" said Lady Middleton.  ""It must besomething extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave mybreakfast table so suddenly.""In about five minutes he returned.""No bad news, Colonel, I hope;"" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as heentered the room.""None at all, ma'am, I thank you.""""Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say that your sister isworse.""""No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.""""But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only aletter of business?  Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hearthe truth of it.""""My dear madam,"" said Lady Middleton, ""recollect what you are saying.""""Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?"" saidMrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof.""No, indeed, it is not.""""Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I hope she is well.""""Whom do you mean, ma'am?"" said he, colouring a little.""Oh! you know who I mean.""""I am particularly sorry, ma'am,"" said he, addressing Lady Middleton,""that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business whichrequires my immediate attendance in town.""""In town!"" cried Mrs. Jennings.  ""What can you have to do in town atthis time of year?""""My own loss is great,"" he continued, ""in being obliged to leave soagreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presenceis necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.""What a blow upon them all was this!""But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,"" saidMarianne, eagerly, ""will it not be sufficient?""He shook his head.""We must go,"" said Sir John.--""It shall not be put off when we are sonear it.  You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.""""I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it is not in my power todelay my journey for one day!""""If you would but let us know what your business is,"" said Mrs.Jennings, ""we might see whether it could be put off or not.""""You would not be six hours later,"" said Willoughby, ""if you were todefer your journey till our return.""""I cannot afford to lose ONE hour.""--Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, ""Thereare some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one ofthem.  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented thistrick for getting out of it.  I would lay fifty guineas the letter wasof his own writing.""""I have no doubt of it,"" replied Marianne.""There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know ofold,"" said Sir John, ""when once you are determined on anything.  But,however, I hope you will think better of it.  Consider, here are thetwo Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walkedup from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before hisusual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.""Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause ofdisappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to beunavoidable.""Well, then, when will you come back again?""""I hope we shall see you at Barton,"" added her ladyship, ""as soon asyou can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party toWhitwell till you return.""""You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain, when I may have it inmy power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.""""Oh! he must and shall come back,"" cried Sir John.  ""If he is not hereby the end of the week, I shall go after him.""""Ay, so do, Sir John,"" cried Mrs. Jennings, ""and then perhaps you mayfind out what his business is.""""I do not want to pry into other men's concerns.  I suppose it issomething he is ashamed of.""Colonel Brandon's horses were announced.""You do not go to town on horseback, do you?"" added Sir John.""No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post.""""Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey.  But youhad better change your mind.""""I assure you it is not in my power.""He then took leave of the whole party.""Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town thiswinter, Miss Dashwood?""""I am afraid, none at all.""""Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish todo.""To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.""Come Colonel,"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""before you go, do let us know whatyou are going about.""He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hithertorestrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again andagain how provoking it was to be so disappointed.""I can guess what his business is, however,"" said Mrs. Jenningsexultingly.""Can you, ma'am?"" said almost every body.""Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure.""""And who is Miss Williams?"" asked Marianne.""What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must haveheard of her before.  She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; avery near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking theyoung ladies."" Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,""She is his natural daughter.""""Indeed!""""Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.  I dare say the Colonelwill leave her all his fortune.""When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regreton so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that asthey were all got together, they must do something by way of beinghappy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that althoughhappiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure atolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  Thecarriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne neverlooked happier than when she got into it.  He drove through the parkvery fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of themwas seen till their return, which did not happen till after the returnof all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive; but saidonly in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the otherswent on the downs.It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and thatevery body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of theCareys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearlytwenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been longseated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said toMarianne, loud enough for them both to hear, ""I have found you out inspite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning.""Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, ""Where, pray?""--""Did not you know,"" said Willoughby, ""that we had been out in mycurricle?""""Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determinedto find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, MissMarianne.  It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much whenI was there six years ago.""Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughedheartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where theyhad been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed thatthey had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there inwalking about the garden and going all over the house.Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikelythat Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the housewhile Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallestacquaintance.As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstancerelated by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angrywith her for doubting it.""Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that wedid not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to doyourself?""""Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and withno other companion than Mr. Willoughby.""""Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shewthat house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible tohave any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in mylife.""""I am afraid,"" replied Elinor, ""that the pleasantness of an employmentdoes not always evince its propriety.""""On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for ifthere had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have beensensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are actingwrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.""""But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some veryimpertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion ofyour own conduct?""""If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof ofimpropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  Iam not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr.Willoughby's, and--""""If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not bejustified in what you have done.""She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to hersister again, and said with great good humour, ""Perhaps, Elinor, it WASrather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wantedparticularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assureyou.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nicecomfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it wouldbe delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  Onone side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to abeautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the churchand village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have sooften admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could bemore forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--acouple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of thepleasantest summer-rooms in England.""Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,she would have described every room in the house with equal delight."
Sense & Sensibility,14,"CHAPTER 14The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with hissteadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised thewonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a greatwonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in allthe comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered, withlittle intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there mustbe some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that couldhave befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escapethem all.""Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,"" said she.""I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstancesmay be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than twothousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I dothink he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else canit be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know thetruth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I daresay it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.  May beshe is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have anotion she is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is aboutMiss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in hiscircumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure musthave cleared the estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be!  May behis sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His settingoff in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out of allhis trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.""So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion varying with everyfresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of ColonelBrandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away,which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that thecircumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement orvariety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It wasengrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby onthe subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to themall.  As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strangeand more incompatible with the disposition of both.  Why they shouldnot openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constantbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could notimagine.She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately intheir power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reasonto believe him rich.  His estate had been rated by Sir John at aboutsix or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which thatincome could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained ofhis poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by themrelative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to theirgeneral opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mindof their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent hermaking any inquiry of Marianne.Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, thanWilloughby's behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishingtenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of thefamily it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  Thecottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many moreof his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no generalengagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called himout in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the restof the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by hisfavourite pointer at her feet.One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left thecountry, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling ofattachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happeningto mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmlyopposed every alteration of a place which affection had established asperfect with him.""What!"" he exclaimed--""Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I willnever consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inchto its size, if my feelings are regarded.""""Do not be alarmed,"" said Miss Dashwood, ""nothing of the kind will bedone; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it.""""I am heartily glad of it,"" he cried.  ""May she always be poor, if shecan employ her riches no better.""""Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I would notsacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any onewhom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon itthat whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts inthe spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of itin a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to thisplace as to see no defect in it?""""I am,"" said he.  ""To me it is faultless.  Nay, more, I consider it asthe only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were Irich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again inthe exact plan of this cottage.""""With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,"" saidElinor.""Yes,"" cried he in the same eager tone, ""with all and every thingbelonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it,should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, undersuch a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been atBarton.""""I flatter myself,"" replied Elinor, ""that even under the disadvantageof better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find yourown house as faultless as you now do this.""""There certainly are circumstances,"" said Willoughby, ""which mightgreatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim ofmy affection, which no other can possibly share.""Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes werefixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well sheunderstood him.""How often did I wish,"" added he, ""when I was at Allenham this timetwelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed withinview of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no oneshould live in it.  How little did I then think that the very firstnews I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediatesatisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind ofprescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can accountfor.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?"" speaking to her in a loweredvoice.  Then continuing his former tone, he said, ""And yet this houseyou would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it of its simplicity byimaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintancefirst began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent byus together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,and every body would be eager to pass through the room which hashitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfortthan any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the worldcould possibly afford.""Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind shouldbe attempted.""You are a good woman,"" he warmly replied.  ""Your promise makes meeasy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell methat not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall everfind you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you willalways consider me with the kindness which has made everythingbelonging to you so dear to me.""The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during thewhole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.""Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?"" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he wasleaving them.  ""I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we mustwalk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton.""He engaged to be with them by four o'clock."
Sense & Sensibility,15,"CHAPTER 15Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, andtwo of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself frombeing of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and hermother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby thenight before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectlysatisfied with her remaining at home.On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle andservant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced thather conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught herto expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne camehastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with herhandkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she hadjust quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning againstthe mantel-piece with his back towards them.  He turned round on theircoming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of theemotion which over-powered Marianne.""Is anything the matter with her?"" cried Mrs. Dashwood as sheentered--""is she ill?""""I hope not,"" he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forcedsmile presently added, ""It is I who may rather expect to be ill--for Iam now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!""""Disappointment?""""Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.  Mrs. Smith hasthis morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependentcousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received mydispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way ofexhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.""""To London!--and are you going this morning?""""Almost this moment.""""This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and herbusiness will not detain you from us long I hope.""He coloured as he replied, ""You are very kind, but I have no idea ofreturning into Devonshire immediately.  My visits to Mrs. Smith arenever repeated within the twelvemonth.""""And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in theneighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, canyou wait for an invitation here?""His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he onlyreplied, ""You are too good.""Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equalamazement.  For a few moments every one was silent.  Mrs. Dashwoodfirst spoke.""I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage youwill always be welcome; for I will not press you to return hereimmediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasingto Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to questionyour judgment than to doubt your inclination.""""My engagements at present,"" replied Willoughby, confusedly, ""are ofsuch a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself""--He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and anotherpause succeeded.  This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faintsmile, ""It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not tormentmyself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it isimpossible for me now to enjoy.""He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw himstep into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted theparlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which thissudden departure occasioned.Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.  She thought ofwhat had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughby's behaviourin taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation ofcheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother'sinvitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared that no serious designhad ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunatequarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress inwhich Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel couldmost reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne'slove for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister'saffliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderestcompassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probabilitynot merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as aduty.In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes werered, her countenance was not uncheerful.""Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,"" said she,as she sat down to work, ""and with how heavy a heart does he travel?""""It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the workof a moment.  And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, soaffectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too withoutintending to return!--Something more than what he owned to us must havehappened.  He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.  YOU musthave seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they havequarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to acceptyour invitation here?""--""It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly seeTHAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it allover I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that atfirst seemed strange to me as well as to you.""""Can you, indeed!""""Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--butyou, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU,I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I ampersuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapprovesof it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on thataccount is eager to get him away;--and that the business which shesends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.This is what I believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware thatshe DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at presentconfess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himselfobliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, andabsent himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affairas satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?""""Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.""""Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rathertake evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for miseryfor Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for thelatter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leaveof us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And isno allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed byrecent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merelybecause they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom wehave all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think illof?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, thoughunavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspecthim of?""""I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant isthe inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessedin him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged ofthe allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to becandid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly havevery sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them atonce.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering atits being practiced by him.""""Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where thedeviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what Ihave said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.""""Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if theyARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must behighly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire atpresent.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.""""Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby andMarianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes havebeen reproaching them every day for incautiousness.""""I want no proof of their affection,"" said Elinor; ""but of theirengagement I do.""""I am perfectly satisfied of both.""""Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either ofthem.""""I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Hasnot his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the lastfortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his futurewife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent beendaily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionaterespect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  Howcould such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed thatWilloughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leaveher, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of hisaffection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange ofconfidence?""""I confess,"" replied Elinor, ""that every circumstance except ONE is infavour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of bothon the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.""""How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt thenature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting apart in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose himreally indifferent to her?""""No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure.""""But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with suchindifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him.""""You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered thismatter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they arefainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If wefind they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.""""A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, youwould suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But Irequire no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed tojustify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformlyopen and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.  It mustbe Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man ofhonour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side tocreate alarm? can he be deceitful?""""I hope not, I believe not,"" cried Elinor.  ""I love Willoughby,sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be morepainful to yourself than to me.  It has been involuntary, and I willnot encourage it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in hismanners this morning;--he did not speak like himself, and did notreturn your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may beexplained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed.  Hehad just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatestaffliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet awarethat by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away forsome time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part byour family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such acase, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been moreto his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his generalcharacter;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conducton so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent.""""You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to besuspected.  Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger inthis part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledgingeverything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is anengagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriagemust be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as itcan be observed, may now be very advisable.""They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was thenat liberty to think over the representations of her mother, toacknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered theroom and took her place at the table without saying a word.  Her eyeswere red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even thenrestrained with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all, couldneither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silentlypressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitudewas quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening.  Shewas without any power, because she was without any desire of commandover herself.  The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughbyoverpowered her in an instant; and though her family were mostanxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if theyspoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelingsconnected with him."
Sense & Sensibility,16,"CHAPTER 16Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been ableto sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby.  Shewould have been ashamed to look her family in the face the nextmorning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose thanwhen she lay down in it.  But the feelings which made such composure adisgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it.  She was awake thewhole night, and she wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with aheadache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding allattempt at consolation from either.  Her sensibility was potent enough!When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered aboutthe village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoymentand crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.  She playedover every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby,every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat atthe instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written outfor her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could begained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.  She spentwhole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voiceoften totally suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as inmusic, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past andpresent was certain of giving.  She read nothing but what they had beenused to read together.Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; itsunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations,still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy.  But Mrs.Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which atleast satisfied herself.""Remember, Elinor,"" said she, ""how very often Sir John fetches ourletters himself from the post, and carries them to it.  We have alreadyagreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that itcould not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass throughSir John's hands.""Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it amotive sufficient for their silence.  But there was one method sodirect, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the realstate of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that shecould not help suggesting it to her mother.""Why do you not ask Marianne at once,"" said she, ""whether she is or sheis not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her mother, and so kind, soindulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would bethe natural result of your affection for her.  She used to be allunreserve, and to you more especially.""""I would not ask such a question for the world.  Supposing it possiblethat they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiryinflict!  At any rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should neverdeserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession ofwhat is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.  I knowMarianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall notbe the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances makethe revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force theconfidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of dutywould prevent the denial which her wishes might direct.""Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister'syouth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, commoncare, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romanticdelicacy.It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned beforeMarianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, werenot so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--butone evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume ofShakespeare, exclaimed,""We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went awaybefore we could get through it.  We will put it by, that when he comesagain...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.""""Months!"" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.  ""No--nor many weeks.""Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinorpleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive ofconfidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne wasprevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead ofwandering away by herself.  Hitherto she had carefully avoided everycompanion in her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on thedowns, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of thevalley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never befound when the others set off.  But at length she was secured by theexertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied withgaining one point, would not then attempt more.  Beyond the entrance ofthe valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild andmore open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on firstcoming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, theystopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed thedistance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they hadnever happened to reach in any of their walks before.Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;it was a man on horseback riding towards them.  In a few minutes theycould distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwardsMarianne rapturously exclaimed,""It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!""--and was hastening to meethim, when Elinor cried out,""Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby.The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.""""He has, he has,"" cried Marianne, ""I am sure he has.  His air, hiscoat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come.""She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne fromparticularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,quickened her pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within thirtyyards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again; her heart sunk withinher; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voicesof both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as wellknown as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop, and sheturned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.He was the only person in the world who could at that moment beforgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained asmile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in hersister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back withthem to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially byMarianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him thaneven Elinor herself.  To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edwardand her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldnesswhich she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.  OnEdward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that alover ought to look and say on such an occasion.  He was confused,seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neitherrapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him byquestions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.  Mariannesaw and listened with increasing surprise.  She began almost to feel adislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, bycarrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed acontrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiriesof meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London.  No,he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.""A fortnight!"" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the samecounty with Elinor without seeing her before.He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying withsome friends near Plymouth.""Have you been lately in Sussex?"" said Elinor.""I was at Norland about a month ago.""""And how does dear, dear Norland look?"" cried Marianne.""Dear, dear Norland,"" said Elinor, ""probably looks much as it alwaysdoes at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly coveredwith dead leaves.""""Oh,"" cried Marianne, ""with what transporting sensation have I formerlyseen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them drivenin showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season,the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  Theyare seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much aspossible from the sight.""""It is not every one,"" said Elinor, ""who has your passion for deadleaves.""""No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  ButSOMETIMES they are.""--As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for afew moments;--but rousing herself again, ""Now, Edward,"" said she,calling his attention to the prospect, ""here is Barton valley.  Look upto it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you eversee their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods andplantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneaththat farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.""""It is a beautiful country,"" he replied; ""but these bottoms must bedirty in winter.""""How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?""""Because,"" replied he, smiling, ""among the rest of the objects beforeme, I see a very dirty lane.""""How strange!"" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.""Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasantpeople?""""No, not all,"" answered Marianne; ""we could not be more unfortunatelysituated.""""Marianne,"" cried her sister, ""how can you say so? How can you be sounjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towardsus have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne,how many pleasant days we have owed to them?""""No,"" said Marianne, in a low voice, ""nor how many painful moments.""Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to theirvisitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, bytalking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extortingfrom him occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reservemortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving toregulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, sheavoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated himas she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection."
Sense & Sensibility,17,"CHAPTER 17Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for hiscoming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.  He receivedthe kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could notstand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him before heentered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivatingmanners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man could not very well be in lovewith either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; andElinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more likehimself.  His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and hisinterest in their welfare again became perceptible.  He was not inspirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, wasattentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits.  The whole familyperceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want ofliberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against allselfish parents.""What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?"" said she,when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; ""are you stillto be a great orator in spite of yourself?""""No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents thaninclination for a public life!""""But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be tosatisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, noaffection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may findit a difficult matter.""""I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished; and haveevery reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forcedinto genius and eloquence.""""You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate.""""As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish aswell as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every bodyelse it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.""""Strange that it would!"" cried Marianne.  ""What have wealth or grandeurto do with happiness?""""Grandeur has but little,"" said Elinor, ""but wealth has much to do withit.""""Elinor, for shame!"" said Marianne, ""money can only give happinesswhere there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it canafford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.""""Perhaps,"" said Elinor, smiling, ""we may come to the same point.  YOURcompetence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and withoutthem, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind ofexternal comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble thanmine.  Come, what is your competence?""""About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT.""Elinor laughed.  ""TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed howit would end.""""And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,"" said Marianne.""A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am notextravagant in my demands.  A proper establishment of servants, acarriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.""Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately theirfuture expenses at Combe Magna.""Hunters!"" repeated Edward--""but why must you have hunters?  Every bodydoes not hunt.""Marianne coloured as she replied, ""But most people do.""""I wish,"" said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, ""that somebodywould give us all a large fortune apiece!""""Oh that they would!"" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling withanimation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginaryhappiness.""We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose,"" said Elinor, ""in spiteof the insufficiency of wealth.""""Oh dear!"" cried Margaret, ""how happy I should be!  I wonder what Ishould do with it!""Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.""I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself,"" said Mrs.Dashwood, ""if my children were all to be rich without my help.""""You must begin your improvements on this house,"" observed Elinor, ""andyour difficulties will soon vanish.""""What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,"" saidEdward, ""in such an event!  What a happy day for booksellers,music-sellers, and print-shops!  You, Miss Dashwood, would give ageneral commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and asfor Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be musicenough in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy upevery copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an oldtwisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am verysaucy.  But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our olddisputes.""""I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy orgay, I love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking offormer times.  You are very right in supposing how my money would bespent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly be employedin improving my collection of music and books.""""And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on theauthors or their heirs.""""No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it.""""Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person whowrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can everbe in love more than once in their life--your opinion on that point isunchanged, I presume?""""Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.  It isnot likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them.""""Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,"" said Elinor, ""she is notat all altered.""""She is only grown a little more grave than she was.""""Nay, Edward,"" said Marianne, ""you need not reproach me.  You are notvery gay yourself.""""Why should you think so!"" replied he, with a sigh.  ""But gaiety neverwas a part of MY character.""""Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's,"" said Elinor; ""I should hardlycall her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all shedoes--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but sheis not often really merry.""""I believe you are right,"" he replied, ""and yet I have always set herdown as a lively girl.""""I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,"" saidElinor, ""in a total misapprehension of character in some point orother: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious orstupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what thedeception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by what they say ofthemselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.""""But I thought it was right, Elinor,"" said Marianne, ""to be guidedwholly by the opinion of other people.  I thought our judgments weregiven us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.  This hasalways been your doctrine, I am sure.""""No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection ofthe understanding.  All I have ever attempted to influence has been thebehaviour.  You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general withgreater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt theirsentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?""""You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan ofgeneral civility,"" said Edward to Elinor.  ""Do you gain no ground?""""Quite the contrary,"" replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.""My judgment,"" he returned, ""is all on your side of the question; but Iam afraid my practice is much more on your sister's.  I never wish tooffend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when Iam only kept back by my natural awkwardness.  I have frequently thoughtthat I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, Iam so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!""""Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,"" saidElinor.""She knows her own worth too well for false shame,"" replied Edward.""Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way orother.  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easyand graceful, I should not be shy.""""But you would still be reserved,"" said Marianne, ""and that is worse.""Edward started--""Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?""""Yes, very.""""I do not understand you,"" replied he, colouring.  ""Reserved!--how, inwhat manner?  What am I to tell you?  What can you suppose?""Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off thesubject, she said to him, ""Do not you know my sister well enough tounderstand what she means?  Do not you know she calls every onereserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires asrapturously as herself?""Edward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on himin their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull."
Sense & Sensibility,18,"CHAPTER 18Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend.  Hisvisit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his ownenjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he wasunhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguishedher by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt ofinspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed veryuncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradictedone moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morningbefore the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager topromote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them tothemselves.  But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlourdoor open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himselfcome out.""I am going into the village to see my horses,"" said he, ""as you arenot yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently.""                    ***Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surroundingcountry; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of thevalley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situationthan the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which hadexceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured Marianne'sattention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration ofthese scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that hadparticularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, ""Youmust not enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge in thepicturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of tasteif we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to bebold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular andrugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to beindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must besatisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it avery fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of finetimber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadowsand several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactlyanswers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty withutility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admireit; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, greymoss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing ofthe picturesque.""""I am afraid it is but too true,"" said Marianne; ""but why should youboast of it?""""I suspect,"" said Elinor, ""that to avoid one kind of affectation,Edward here falls into another.  Because he believes many peoplepretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they reallyfeel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greaterindifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than hepossesses.  He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own.""""It is very true,"" said Marianne, ""that admiration of landscape sceneryis become a mere jargon.  Every body pretends to feel and tries todescribe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined whatpicturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes Ihave kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language todescribe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense andmeaning.""""I am convinced,"" said Edward, ""that you really feel all the delight ina fine prospect which you profess to feel.  But, in return, your sistermust allow me to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked, twisted,blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, andflourishing.  I do not like ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fondof nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in asnug farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy, happy villagesplease me better than the finest banditti in the world.""Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at hersister.  Elinor only laughed.The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remainedthoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plaitof hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.""I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,"" she cried.  ""Is thatFanny's hair? I remember her promising to give you some.  But I shouldhave thought her hair had been darker.""Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she sawhow much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thoughtcould not be surpassed by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving amomentary glance at Elinor, replied, ""Yes; it is my sister's hair.  Thesetting always casts a different shade on it, you know.""Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.  That the hairwas her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianneconsidered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious musthave been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, andaffecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking ofsomething else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch everyopportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond alldoubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence ofmind still more settled.  He was particularly grave the whole morning.Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her ownforgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how littleoffence it had given her sister.Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at thecottage, came to take a survey of the guest.  With the assistance ofhis mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the nameof Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of railleryagainst the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of theiracquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediatelysprung.  But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significantlooks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions,extended.Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them todine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wishedto engage them for both.""You MUST drink tea with us to night,"" said he, ""for we shall be quitealone--and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be alarge party.""Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  ""And who knows but you may raisea dance,"" said she.  ""And that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.""""A dance!"" cried Marianne.  ""Impossible! Who is to dance?""""Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.--What!you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall benameless is gone!""""I wish with all my soul,"" cried Sir John, ""that Willoughby were amongus again.""This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward.  ""And whois Willoughby?"" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom hewas sitting.She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne's countenance was morecommunicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaningof others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled himbefore; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately roundher, and said, in a whisper, ""I have been guessing.  Shall I tell youmy guess?""""What do you mean?""""Shall I tell you.""""Certainly.""""Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts.""Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling atthe quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment's silence, said,""Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come I hope...I am sureyou will like him.""""I do not doubt it,"" replied he, rather astonished at her earnestnessand warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of heracquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothingbetween Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured tomention it."
Sense & Sensibility,19,"CHAPTER 19Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs.Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only onself-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoymentamong his friends was at the height.  His spirits, during the last twoor three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--hegrew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke ofgoing away without a sigh--declared his time to be whollydisengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he leftthem--but still, go he must.  Never had any week passed so quickly--hecould hardly believe it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly; otherthings he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave thelie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested beingin town; but either to Norland or London, he must go.  He valued theirkindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being withthem.  Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of theirwishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to hismother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whosecharacter was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excusefor every thing strange on the part of her son.  Disappointed, however,and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertainbehaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regardhis actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, forWilloughby's service, by her mother.  His want of spirits, of openness,and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want ofindependence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's dispositionand designs.  The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purposein leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the sameinevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.  The oldwell-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,was the cause of all.  She would have been glad to know when thesedifficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs.Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.  Butfrom such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewalof her confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of everymark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, andabove all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore roundhis finger.""I think, Edward,"" said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast thelast morning, ""you would be a happier man if you had any profession toengage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions.  Someinconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you wouldnot be able to give them so much of your time.  But (with a smile) youwould be materially benefited in one particular at least--you wouldknow where to go when you left them.""""I do assure you,"" he replied, ""that I have long thought on this point,as you think now.  It has been, and is, and probably will always be aheavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engageme, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing likeindependence.  But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of myfriends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We nevercould agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred thechurch, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.They recommended the army.  That was a great deal too smart for me.The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who hadchambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the firstcircles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had noinclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, whichmy family approved.  As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but Iwas too old when the subject was first started to enter it--and, atlength, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all,as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back aswith one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageousand honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general soearnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of hisfriends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have beenproperly idle ever since.""""The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,"" said Mrs. Dashwood,""since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons willbe brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and tradesas Columella's.""""They will be brought up,"" said he, in a serious accent, ""to be asunlike myself as is possible.  In feeling, in action, in condition, inevery thing.""""Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlikeyourself must be happy.  But remember that the pain of parting fromfriends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be theireducation or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want nothing butpatience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.  Yourmother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are soanxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become herhappiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.How much may not a few months do?""""I think,"" replied Edward, ""that I may defy many months to produce anygood to me.""This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated toMrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, whichshortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor'sfeelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herselffrom appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on hisgoing away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed byMarianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, byseeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means were as differentas their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of thehouse, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought noravoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost asmuch as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by thisconduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least preventedfrom unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared muchsolicitude on her account.Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared nomore meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.The business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strongaffections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.That her sister's affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though sheblushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave avery striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, inspite of this mortifying conviction.Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house indetermined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night toindulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enoughto think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possiblevariety which the different state of her spirits at different timescould produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of hermother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude wasproduced.  Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could notbe chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject sointeresting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engrossher memory, her reflection, and her fancy.From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she wasroused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival ofcompany.  She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the littlegate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drewher eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to thedoor.  Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknownto her.  She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir Johnperceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony ofknocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to openthe casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between thedoor and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at onewithout being heard at the other.""Well,"" said he, ""we have brought you some strangers.  How do you likethem?""""Hush! they will hear you.""""Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.  Charlotte is verypretty, I can tell you.  You may see her if you look this way.""As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, withouttaking that liberty, she begged to be excused.""Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see herinstrument is open.""""She is walking, I believe.""They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough towait till the door was opened before she told HER story.  She camehallooing to the window, ""How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs.Dashwood do?  And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you will beglad of a little company to sit with you.  I have brought my other sonand daughter to see you.  Only think of their coming so suddenly!  Ithought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,but it never entered my head that it could be them.  I thought ofnothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; soI said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is ColonelBrandon come back again""--Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, toreceive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the twostrangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the sametime, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jenningscontinued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour,attended by Sir John.Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totallyunlike her in every respect.  She was short and plump, had a verypretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that couldpossibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's,but they were much more prepossessing.  She came in with a smile,smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiledwhen she went away.  Her husband was a grave looking young man of fiveor six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife,but of less willingness to please or be pleased.  He entered the roomwith a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, withoutspeaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and theirapartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to readit as long as he staid.Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with aturn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before heradmiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.""Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything socharming!  Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last!I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs.Dashwood) but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister, howdelightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!Should not you, Mr. Palmer?""Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from thenewspaper.""Mr. Palmer does not hear me,"" said she, laughing; ""he never doessometimes.  It is so ridiculous!""This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used tofind wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking withsurprise at them both.Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, andcontinued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeingtheir friends, without ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmerlaughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and everybody agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite anagreeable surprise.""You may believe how glad we all were to see them,"" added Mrs.Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voiceas if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated ondifferent sides of the room; ""but, however, I can't help wishing theyhad not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,for they came all round by London upon account of some business, foryou know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it waswrong in her situation.  I wanted her to stay at home and rest thismorning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all!""Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.""She expects to be confined in February,"" continued Mrs. Jennings.Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, andtherefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news inthe paper.""No, none at all,"" he replied, and read on.""Here comes Marianne,"" cried Sir John.  ""Now, Palmer, you shall see amonstrous pretty girl.""He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, andushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as sheappeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed soheartily at the question, as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmerlooked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, andthen returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught bythe drawings which hung round the room.  She got up to examine them.""Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!  Do butlook, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could lookat them for ever."" And then sitting down again, she very soon forgotthat there were any such things in the room.When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid downthe newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.""My love, have you been asleep?"" said his wife, laughing.He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining theroom, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day atthe park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftenerthan they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account;her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no curiosity tosee how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation ofpleasure from them in any other way.  They attempted, therefore,likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and notlikely to be good.  But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriageshould be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too, thoughshe did not press their mother, pressed them.  Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid afamily party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.""Why should they ask us?"" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.""The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on veryhard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is stayingeither with them, or with us.""""They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,"" said Elinor, ""bythese frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them afew weeks ago.  The alteration is not in them, if their parties aregrown tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere."""
Sense & Sensibility,20,"CHAPTER 20As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the nextday, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking asgood humoured and merry as before.  She took them all mostaffectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing themagain.""I am so glad to see you!"" said she, seating herself between Elinor andMarianne, ""for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We mustgo, for the Westons come to us next week you know.  It was quite asudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till thecarriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if Iwould go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never tells me anything! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet againin town very soon, I hope.""They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.""Not go to town!"" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, ""I shall be quitedisappointed if you do not.  I could get the nicest house in the world foryou, next door to ours, in Hanover-square.  You must come, indeed.  Iam sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I amconfined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.""They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.""Oh, my love,"" cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then enteredthe room--""you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go totown this winter.""Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, begancomplaining of the weather.""How horrid all this is!"" said he.  ""Such weather makes every thing andevery body disgusting.  Dullness is as much produced within doors aswithout, by rain.  It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.  Whatthe devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in hishouse?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir John is as stupid asthe weather.""The rest of the company soon dropt in.""I am afraid, Miss Marianne,"" said Sir John, ""you have not been able totake your usual walk to Allenham today.""Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.""Oh, don't be so sly before us,"" said Mrs. Palmer; ""for we know allabout it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I thinkhe is extremely handsome.  We do not live a great way from him in thecountry, you know.  Not above ten miles, I dare say.""""Much nearer thirty,"" said her husband.""Ah, well! there is not much difference.  I never was at his house; butthey say it is a sweet pretty place.""""As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,"" said Mr. Palmer.Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed herinterest in what was said.""Is it very ugly?"" continued Mrs. Palmer--""then it must be some otherplace that is so pretty I suppose.""When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regretthat they were only eight all together.""My dear,"" said he to his lady, ""it is very provoking that we should beso few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?""""Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,that it could not be done?  They dined with us last.""""You and I, Sir John,"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""should not stand upon suchceremony.""""Then you would be very ill-bred,"" cried Mr. Palmer.""My love you contradict every body,"" said his wife with her usuallaugh.  ""Do you know that you are quite rude?""""I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your motherill-bred.""""Ay, you may abuse me as you please,"" said the good-natured old lady,""you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again.So there I have the whip hand of you.""Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get ridof her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,as they must live together.  It was impossible for any one to be morethoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of herhusband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she washighly diverted.""Mr. Palmer is so droll!"" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor.  ""He isalways out of humour.""Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him creditfor being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as hewished to appear.  His temper might perhaps be a little soured byfinding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountablebias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very sillywoman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for anysensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish ofdistinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment ofevery body, and his general abuse of every thing before him.  It wasthe desire of appearing superior to other people.  The motive was toocommon to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed byestablishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attachany one to him except his wife.""Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,"" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, ""I havegot such a favour to ask of you and your sister.  Will you come andspend some time at Cleveland this Christmas?  Now, pray do,--and comewhile the Westons are with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!It will be quite delightful!--My love,"" applying to her husband, ""don'tyou long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?""""Certainly,"" he replied, with a sneer--""I came into Devonshire with noother view.""""There now,""--said his lady, ""you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so youcannot refuse to come.""They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.""But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you will like it of allthings.  The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gaynow, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassingagainst the election; and so many people came to dine with us that Inever saw before, it is quite charming!  But, poor fellow! it is veryfatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.""Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to thehardship of such an obligation.""How charming it will be,"" said Charlotte, ""when he is inParliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!  It will be so ridiculous tosee all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do you know, hesays, he will never frank for me?  He declares he won't.  Don't you,Mr. Palmer?""Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.""He cannot bear writing, you know,"" she continued--""he says it is quiteshocking.""""No,"" said he, ""I never said any thing so irrational.  Don't palm allyour abuses of languages upon me.""""There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always the way with him!Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then hecomes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world.""She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.""Certainly,"" said Elinor; ""he seems very agreeable.""""Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would, he is so pleasant;and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I cantell you, and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don'tcome to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object to it.""Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing thesubject, put a stop to her entreaties.  She thought it probable that asthey lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give somemore particular account of Willoughby's general character, than couldbe gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with him; and shewas eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits asmight remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began byinquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whetherthey were intimately acquainted with him.""Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,"" replied Mrs. Palmer;--""Notthat I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he wasat Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--but I was with my uncleat Weymouth.  However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal ofhim in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that weshould never have been in the country together.  He is very little atCombe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr.Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, andbesides it is such a way off.  I know why you inquire about him, verywell; your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it, for thenI shall have her for a neighbour you know.""""Upon my word,"" replied Elinor, ""you know much more of the matter thanI do, if you have any reason to expect such a match.""""Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talksof.  I assure you I heard of it in my way through town.""""My dear Mrs. Palmer!""""Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning inBond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.""""You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell you of it!  Surelyyou must be mistaken.  To give such intelligence to a person who couldnot be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I shouldexpect Colonel Brandon to do.""""But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you howit happened.  When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; andso we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing andanother, and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family come toBarton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty,and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of CombeMagna.  Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have beenin Devonshire so lately.'""""And what did the Colonel say?""""Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, sofrom that moment I set it down as certain.  It will be quitedelightful, I declare!  When is it to take place?""""Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?""""Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing butsay fine things of you.""""I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems an excellent man; and Ithink him uncommonly pleasing.""""So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he shouldbe so grave and so dull.  Mama says HE was in love with your sistertoo.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardlyever falls in love with any body.""""Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?"" saidElinor.""Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people areacquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they allthink him extremely agreeable I assure you.  Nobody is more liked thanMr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.  Sheis a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that heis much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome andagreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.  However, I don'tthink her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I thinkyou both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,though we could not get him to own it last night.""Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby was not very material;but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.""I am so glad we are got acquainted at last,"" continuedCharlotte.--""And now I hope we shall always be great friends.  Youcan't think how much I longed to see you!  It is so delightful that youshould live at the cottage!  Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  And Iam so glad your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will bea great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place, by all accounts.""""You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?""""Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.-- He was aparticular friend of Sir John's. I believe,"" she added in a low voice,""he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir Johnand Lady Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think thematch good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it tothe Colonel, and we should have been married immediately.""""Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal to your motherbefore it was made?  Had he never owned his affection to yourself?""""Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would haveliked it of all things.  He had not seen me then above twice, for itwas before I left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.  Mr.Palmer is the kind of man I like."""
Sense & Sensibility,21,"CHAPTER 21The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families atBarton were again left to entertain each other.  But this did not lastlong; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, hadhardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, atMr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strangeunsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before SirJohn's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society,procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be herrelations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly tothe park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such aninvitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on thereturn of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive avisit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whoseelegance,--whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; forthe assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went fornothing at all.  Their being her relations too made it so much theworse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were thereforeunfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care abouttheir being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must putup with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to preventtheir coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, withall the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merelygiving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six timesevery day.The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel orunfashionable.  Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that LadyMiddleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they hadbeen an hour at the Park.  She declared them to be very agreeable girlsindeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.  Sir John'sconfidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and heset off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the MissSteeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girlsin the world.  From such commendation as this, however, there was notmuch to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in theworld were to be met with in every part of England, under everypossible variation of form, face, temper and understanding.  Sir Johnwanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at hisguests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It was painful to him even tokeep a third cousin to himself.""Do come now,"" said he--""pray come--you must come--I declare you shallcome--You can't think how you will like them.  Lucy is monstrouspretty, and so good humoured and agreeable!  The children are allhanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance.  And theyboth long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter thatyou are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told themit is all very true, and a great deal more.  You will be delighted withthem I am sure.  They have brought the whole coach full of playthingsfor the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?  Why theyare your cousins, you know, after a fashion.  YOU are my cousins, andthey are my wife's, so you must be related.""But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain a promise oftheir calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them inamazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of theirattractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of theMiss Steeles to them.When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction tothese young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of theeldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensibleface, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two orthree and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her featureswere pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinctionto her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soonallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with whatconstant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeableto Lady Middleton.  With her children they were in continual raptures,extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring theirwhims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunatedemands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration ofwhatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which herappearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fondmother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the mostrapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demandsare exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessiveaffection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring wereviewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise ordistrust.  She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinentencroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, theirwork-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and feltno doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no othersurprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,without claiming a share in what was passing.""John is in such spirits today!"" said she, on his taking Miss Steeles'spocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--""He is full ofmonkey tricks.""And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of thesame lady's fingers, she fondly observed, ""How playful William is!""""And here is my sweet little Annamaria,"" she added, tenderly caressinga little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the lasttwo minutes; ""And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was theresuch a quiet little thing!""But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship'shead dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from thispattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdoneby any creature professedly noisy.  The mother's consternation wasexcessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, andevery thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, whichaffection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the littlesufferer.  She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, herwound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who wason her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums bythe other.  With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise tocease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her twobrothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings wereineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene ofsimilar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had beensuccessfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerlyproposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission ofscreams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope thatit would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room thereforein her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boyschose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to staybehind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the roomhad not known for many hours.""Poor little creatures!"" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.""It might have been a very sad accident.""""Yet I hardly know how,"" cried Marianne, ""unless it had been undertotally different circumstances.  But this is the usual way ofheightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.""""What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!"" said Lucy Steele.Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did notfeel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the wholetask of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.  She didher best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with morewarmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.""And Sir John too,"" cried the elder sister, ""what a charming man he is!""Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only simple and just,came in without any eclat.  She merely observed that he was perfectlygood humoured and friendly.""And what a charming little family they have!  I never saw such finechildren in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already, andindeed I am always distractedly fond of children.""""I should guess so,"" said Elinor, with a smile, ""from what I havewitnessed this morning.""""I have a notion,"" said Lucy, ""you think the little Middletons rathertoo much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it isso natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see childrenfull of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame andquiet.""""I confess,"" replied Elinor, ""that while I am at Barton Park, I neverthink of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.""A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by MissSteele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who nowsaid rather abruptly, ""And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.""In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least ofthe manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.""Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?"" added Miss Steele.""We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,"" said Lucy, who seemedto think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.""I think every one MUST admire it,"" replied Elinor, ""who ever saw theplace; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate itsbeauties as we do.""""And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I suppose you have not somany in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vastaddition always.""""But why should you think,"" said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,""that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?""""Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there an't.  I'msure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how couldI tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was onlyafraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had notso many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies may notcare about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them.For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dresssmart and behave civil.  But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty.Now there's Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite abeau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him ofa morning, he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quitea beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?""""Upon my word,"" replied Elinor, ""I cannot tell you, for I do notperfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.  But this I can say, thatif he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there isnot the smallest alteration in him.""""Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's being beaux--they havesomething else to do.""""Lord! Anne,"" cried her sister, ""you can talk of nothing butbeaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else.""And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house and thefurniture.This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.  The vulgar freedom andfolly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was notblinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her wantof real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wishof knowing them better.Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided withadmiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all hisrelations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his faircousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whomthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to bebetter acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitablelot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind ofintimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or twotogether in the same room almost every day.  Sir John could do no more;but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, inhis opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for theirmeeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being establishedfriends.To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote theirunreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knewor supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicateparticulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before theeldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky asto make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.""'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure,"" saidshe, ""and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome.  And Ihope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may havea friend in the corner already.""Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice inproclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had beenwith respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke ofthe two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and sinceEdward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking toher best affections with so much significancy and so many nods andwinks, as to excite general attention.  The letter F--had been likewiseinvariably brought forward, and found productive of such countlessjokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet hadbeen long established with Elinor.The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of thesejokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know thename of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinentlyexpressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitivenessinto the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not sport longwith the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least asmuch pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.""His name is Ferrars,"" said he, in a very audible whisper; ""but pray donot tell it, for it's a great secret.""""Ferrars!"" repeated Miss Steele; ""Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?What! your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeableyoung man to be sure; I know him very well.""""How can you say so, Anne?"" cried Lucy, who generally made an amendmentto all her sister's assertions.  ""Though we have seen him once or twiceat my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well.""Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.  ""And who was thisuncle?  Where did he live?  How came they acquainted?""  She wished verymuch to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join init herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time inher life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity afterpetty information, or in a disposition to communicate it.  The mannerin which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; forit struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicionof that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something to hisdisadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther noticewas taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or evenopenly mentioned by Sir John."
Sense & Sensibility,22,"CHAPTER 22Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing likeimpertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference oftaste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, fromthe state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or toencourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of herbehaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy ontheir side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herselfwhich soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially ofLucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or ofstriving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frankcommunication of her sentiments.Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing; andas a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable;but her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant andilliterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want ofinformation in the most common particulars, could not be concealed fromMiss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear toadvantage.  Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilitieswhich education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, withless tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, ofrectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, herassiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have nolasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insinceritywith ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting inconversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others madeevery shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectlyvalueless.""You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,"" said Lucy to herone day, as they were walking together from the park to thecottage--""but pray, are you personally acquainted with yoursister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?""Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenanceexpressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.""Indeed!"" replied Lucy; ""I wonder at that, for I thought you must haveseen her at Norland sometimes.  Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me whatsort of a woman she is?""""No,"" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward'smother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinentcuriosity-- ""I know nothing of her.""""I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such away,"" said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; ""but perhapsthere may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope youwill do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to beimpertinent.""Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes insilence.  It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again bysaying, with some hesitation,""I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.  I am sure Iwould rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a personwhose good opinion is so well worth having as yours.  And I am sure Ishould not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should bevery glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortablesituation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars.""""I am sorry I do NOT,"" said Elinor, in great astonishment, ""if it couldbe of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.  But really I neverunderstood that you were at all connected with that family, andtherefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiryinto her character.""""I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it.  Butif I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised.  Mrs.Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time MAYcome--how soon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may bevery intimately connected.""She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one sideglance at her companion to observe its effect on her.""Good heavens!"" cried Elinor, ""what do you mean?  Are you acquaintedwith Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?"" And she did not feel muchdelighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.""No,"" replied Lucy, ""not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I never saw him in mylife; but,"" fixing her eyes upon Elinor, ""to his eldest brother.""What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been aspainful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of theassertion attended it.  She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and thoughher complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in nodanger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.""You may well be surprised,"" continued Lucy; ""for to be sure you couldhave had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped thesmallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was alwaysmeant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept soby me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations know of it butAnne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not feltthe greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I reallythought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrarsmust seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.  And I do not thinkMr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you,because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all yourfamily, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite ashis own sisters.""--She paused.Elinor for a few moments remained silent.  Her astonishment at what sheheard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herselfto speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- ""May I askif your engagement is of long standing?""""We have been engaged these four years.""""Four years!""""Yes.""Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.""I did not know,"" said she, ""that you were even acquainted till theother day.""""Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.  He was under myuncle's care, you know, a considerable while.""""Your uncle!""""Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?""""I think I have,"" replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, whichincreased with her increase of emotion.""He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, nearPlymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and mewas often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement wasformed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but hewas almost always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enterinto it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation ofhis mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be soprudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so wellas me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensiblehe is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.""""Certainly,"" answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but aftera moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward'shonour and love, and her companion's falsehood--""Engaged to Mr. EdwardFerrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistakeof person or name.  We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.""""We can mean no other,"" cried Lucy, smiling.  ""Mr. Edward Ferrars, theeldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of yoursister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allowthat I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on whoall my happiness depends.""""It is strange,"" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, ""that Ishould never have heard him even mention your name.""""No; considering our situation, it was not strange.  Our first care hasbeen to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me, or my family,and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my nameto you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister'ssuspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it.""She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her self-command did notsink with it.""Four years you have been engaged,"" said she with a firm voice.""Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.  PoorEdward!  It puts him quite out of heart."" Then taking a small miniaturefrom her pocket, she added, ""To prevent the possibility of mistake, beso good as to look at this face.  It does not do him justice, to besure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it wasdrew for.--I have had it above these three years.""She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw thepainting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, orher wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, shecould have none of its being Edward's face.  She returned it almostinstantly, acknowledging the likeness.""I have never been able,"" continued Lucy, ""to give him my picture inreturn, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always soanxious to get it!  But I am determined to set for it the very firstopportunity.""""You are quite in the right,"" replied Elinor calmly.  They thenproceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.""I am sure,"" said she, ""I have no doubt in the world of your faithfullykeeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is tous, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,I dare say.  I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceedingproud woman.""""I certainly did not seek your confidence,"" said Elinor; ""but you do meno more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on.  Yoursecret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at sounnecessary a communication.  You must at least have felt that my beingacquainted with it could not add to its safety.""As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discoversomething in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatestpart of what she had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered nochange.""I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,""said she, ""in telling you all this.  I have not known you long to besure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family bydescription a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost asif you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case, I reallythought some explanation was due to you after my making such particularinquiries about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I havenot a creature whose advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person thatknows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me agreat deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of herbetraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you mustperceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the worldt'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest sheshould out with it all.  You can't think how much I go through in mymind from it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what Ihave suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.  Every thing insuch suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardlymeet above twice a-year.  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quitebroke.""Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel verycompassionate.""Sometimes."" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, ""I think whether itwould not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.""  Asshe said this, she looked directly at her companion.  ""But then atother times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I cannot bear thethoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of sucha thing would do.  And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--Idon't think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise me to do insuch a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you do yourself?""""Pardon me,"" replied Elinor, startled by the question; ""but I can giveyou no advice under such circumstances.  Your own judgment must directyou.""""To be sure,"" continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on bothsides, ""his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poorEdward is so cast down by it!  Did you not think him dreadfullow-spirited when he was at Barton?  He was so miserable when he leftus at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think himquite ill.""""Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?""""Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.  Did you think hecame directly from town?""""No,"" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every freshcircumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; ""I remember he told us, thathe had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth."" Sheremembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothingfarther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even totheir names.""Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?"" repeated Lucy.""We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.""""I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was thematter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more thana fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--Iam afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretchedspirits.  I heard from him just before I left Exeter;"" taking a letterfrom her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.  ""Youknow his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is notwritten so well as usual.--He was tired, I dare say, for he had justfilled the sheet to me as full as possible.""Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer.  Thispicture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have beenaccidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but acorrespondence between them by letter, could subsist only under apositive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a fewmoments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and shecould hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and shestruggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, thather success was speedy, and for the time complete.""Writing to each other,"" said Lucy, returning the letter into herpocket, ""is the only comfort we have in such long separations.  Yes, Ihave one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not evenTHAT.  If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.  I gave hima lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, andthat was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?""""I did,"" said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which wasconcealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever feltbefore.  She was mortified, shocked, confounded.Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and theconversation could be continued no farther.  After sitting with them afew minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was thenat liberty to think and be wretched.[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume 1 ends.]"
Sense & Sensibility,23,"CHAPTER 23However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be,it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in thepresent case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly ofinventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy had asserted tobe true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supportedas it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, andcontradicted by nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity ofacquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plymouth,his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects,his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of theMiss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which hadoften surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formedaltogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear ofcondemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partialitycould set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment of suchbehaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short timemade her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,soon arose.  Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had hefeigned a regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement toLucy an engagement of the heart?  No; whatever it might once have been,she could not believe it such at present.  His affection was all herown.  She could not be deceived in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny,all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not anillusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.  What a softenerof the heart was this persuasion!  How much could it not tempt her toforgive!  He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining atNorland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than itought to be.  In that, he could not be defended; but if he had injuredher, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable,his was hopeless.  His imprudence had made her miserable for a while;but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever beingotherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had heto look forward to?  Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele;could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with hisintegrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with awife like her--illiterate, artful, and selfish?The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to everything but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeedingyears--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to theunderstanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior societyand more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicitywhich might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficultiesfrom his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likelyto be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior inconnections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.  Thesedifficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might notpress very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of theperson by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,could be felt as a relief!As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she weptfor him, more than for herself.  Supported by the conviction of havingdone nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by thebelief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thoughtshe could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, commandherself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her motherand sisters.  And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had firstsuffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would havesupposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourningin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the objectof her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on theperfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughlypossessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drovenear their house.The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had beenentrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasingexertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress.  On the contrary itwas a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would givesuch affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing thatcondemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess oftheir partial affection for herself, and which was more than she feltequal to support.From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receiveno assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from theirexample nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone, and her owngood sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets sopoignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on thesubject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this formore reasons than one.  She wanted to hear many particulars of theirengagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand whatLucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in herdeclaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted toconvince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and hercalmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested init than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntaryagitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at leastdoubtful.  That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared veryprobable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in herpraise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing totrust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret soconfessedly and evidently important.  And even Sir John's jokingintelligence must have had some weight.  But indeed, while Elinorremained so well assured within herself of being really beloved byEdward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make itnatural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her veryconfidence was a proof.  What other reason for the disclosure of theaffair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it ofLucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival'sintentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as everyprinciple of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affectionfor Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not denyherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart wasunwounded.  And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear onthe subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her ownability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could becommanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to takeadvantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fineenough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might mosteasily separate themselves from the others; and though they met atleast every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly atthe former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake ofconversation.  Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or LadyMiddleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given fora general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.  They met forthe sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affordingElinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called atthe cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that theywould all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged toattend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.  Elinor, who foresaw afairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as thiswas likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquiland well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband unitedthem together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted theinvitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equallycompliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of theirparties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have herseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved fromthe frightful solitude which had threatened her.  The insipidity of themeeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not onenovelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interestingthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour anddrawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and whilethey remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility ofengaging Lucy's attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with theremoval of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed, and Elinorbegan to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope offinding time for conversation at the park.  They all rose up inpreparation for a round game.""I am glad,"" said Lady Middleton to Lucy, ""you are not going to finishpoor little Annamaria's basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurtyour eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make the dearlittle love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then Ihope she will not much mind it.""This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,""Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waitingto know whether you can make your party without me, or I should havebeen at my filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angelfor all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I amresolved to finish the basket after supper.""""You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--will you ring thebell for some working candles?  My poor little girl would be sadlydisappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, forthough I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends uponhaving it done.""Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with analacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste nogreater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.  No one madeany objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the formsof general civility, exclaimed, ""Your Ladyship will have the goodnessto excuse ME--you know I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;I have not touched it since it was tuned.""  And without fartherceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never madeso rude a speech.""Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am,""said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; ""and I do notmuch wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I everheard.""The remaining five were now to draw their cards.""Perhaps,"" continued Elinor, ""if I should happen to cut out, I may beof some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; andthere is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must beimpossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.  Ishould like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.""""Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,"" cried Lucy,""for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria afterall.""""Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,"" said Miss Steele-- ""Dear littlesoul, how I do love her!""""You are very kind,"" said Lady Middleton to Elinor; ""and as you reallylike the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in tillanother rubber, or will you take your chance now?""Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by alittle of that address which Marianne could never condescend topractise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the sametime.  Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fairrivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with theutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.  The pianoforte atwhich Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, hadby this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she mightsafely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interestingsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table."
Sense & Sensibility,24,"CHAPTER 24In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.""I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on itssubject.  I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.""""Thank you,"" cried Lucy warmly, ""for breaking the ice; you have set myheart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offendedyou by what I told you that Monday.""""Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,"" and Elinor spokeit with the truest sincerity, ""nothing could be farther from myintention than to give you such an idea.  Could you have a motive forthe trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?""""And yet I do assure you,"" replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full ofmeaning, ""there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in yourmanner that made me quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you wasangry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, forhaving took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.  But I amvery glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do notblame me.  If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve myheart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment ofmy life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I amsure.""""Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shallnever have reason to repent it.  Your case is a very unfortunate one;you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will haveneed of all your mutual affection to support you under them.  Mr.Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.""""He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness tomarry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospectof more without a sigh.  I have been always used to a very smallincome, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him toowell to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that hismother might give him if he married to please her.  We must wait, itmay be for many years.  With almost every other man in the world, itwould be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancynothing can deprive me of I know.""""That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedlysupported by the same trust in your's.  If the strength of yourreciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and undermany circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement,your situation would have been pitiable, indeed.""Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenancefrom every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency.""Edward's love for me,"" said Lucy, ""has been pretty well put to thetest, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, andit has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubtit now.  I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarmon that account from the first.""Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.Lucy went on.  ""I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and fromour different situations in life, from his being so much more in theworld than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined forsuspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had beenthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or anylowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talkedmore of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy atLongstaple than he used to be.  I do not mean to say that I amparticularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a caseI am sure I could not be deceived.""""All this,"" thought Elinor, ""is very pretty; but it can impose uponneither of us.""""But what,"" said she after a short silence, ""are your views? or haveyou none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is amelancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit tothis, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in whichit may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for awhile by owning the truth?""""If we could be certain that it would be only for a while!  But Mrs.Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of angerupon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, andthe idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away all my inclinationfor hasty measures.""""And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestednessbeyond reason.""Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.""Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?"" asked Elinor.""Not at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike hisbrother--silly and a great coxcomb.""""A great coxcomb!"" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught thosewords by a sudden pause in Marianne's music.-- ""Oh, they are talking oftheir favourite beaux, I dare say.""""No sister,"" cried Lucy, ""you are mistaken there, our favourite beauxare NOT great coxcombs.""""I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not,"" said Mrs. Jennings,laughing heartily; ""for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behavedyoung men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly littlecreature, there is no finding out who SHE likes.""""Oh,"" cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, ""I daresay Lucy's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as MissDashwood's.""Elinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her lip, and lookedangrily at her sister.  A mutual silence took place for some time.Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Mariannewas then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificentconcerto--""I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into myhead, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you intothe secret, for you are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seenenough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every otherprofession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as hecan, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kindenough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regardto me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living;which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent notlikely to live a great while.  That would be enough for us to marryupon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest.""""I should always be happy,"" replied Elinor, ""to show any mark of myesteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that myinterest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He isbrother to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough toher husband.""""But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward's going intoorders.""""Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little.""They were again silent for many minutes.  At length Lucy exclaimed witha deep sigh,""I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business atonce by dissolving the engagement.  We seem so beset with difficultieson every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, weshould be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will not give me youradvice, Miss Dashwood?""""No,"" answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitatedfeelings, ""on such a subject I certainly will not.  You know very wellthat my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on theside of your wishes.""""Indeed you wrong me,"" replied Lucy, with great solemnity; ""I knownobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I doreally believe, that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by allmeans to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will bemore for the happiness of both of you,' I should resolve upon doing itimmediately.""Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's future wife, andreplied, ""This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving anyopinion on the subject had I formed one.  It raises my influence muchtoo high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is toomuch for an indifferent person.""""'Tis because you are an indifferent person,"" said Lucy, with somepique, and laying a particular stress on those words, ""that yourjudgment might justly have such weight with me.  If you could besupposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinionwould not be worth having.""Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they mightprovoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; andwas even partly determined never to mention the subject again.  Anotherpause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech, andLucy was still the first to end it.""Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?"" said she with allher accustomary complacency.""Certainly not.""""I am sorry for that,"" returned the other, while her eyes brightened atthe information, ""it would have gave me such pleasure to meet youthere!  But I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure, yourbrother and sister will ask you to come to them.""""It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do.""""How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations whohave been wanting us to visit them these several years!  But I only gofor the sake of seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwiseLondon would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it.""Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the firstrubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was thereforeat an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, fornothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each otherless than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card tablewith the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only withoutaffection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had noteven the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincereaffection on HER side would have given, for self-interest alone couldinduce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed sothoroughly aware that he was weary.From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and whenentered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it,and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happinesswhenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by theformer with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civilitywould allow; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence whichLucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyondwhat the first invitation implied.  Their favour increased; they couldnot be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite oftheir numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of theabsolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which wasin full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to staynearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration ofthat festival which requires a more than ordinary share of privateballs and large dinners to proclaim its importance."
Sense & Sensibility,25,"CHAPTER 25Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion ofthe year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not withouta settled habitation of her own.  Since the death of her husband, whohad traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she hadresided every winter in a house in one of the streets near PortmanSquare.  Towards this home, she began on the approach of January toturn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and veryunexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her.Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and theanimated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gavea grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herselfto be speaking their united inclinations.  The reason alleged was theirdetermined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of theyear.  Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, andrepeated her invitation immediately.""Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO begyou will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart uponit.  Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan'tput myself at all out of my way for you.  It will only be sending Bettyby the coach, and I hope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able togo very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do not liketo go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of mydaughters.  I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have hadsuch good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she willthink me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don'tget one of you at least well married before I have done with you, itshall not be my fault.  I shall speak a good word for you to all theyoung men, you may depend upon it.""""I have a notion,"" said Sir John, ""that Miss Marianne would not objectto such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it.  It is veryhard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because MissDashwood does not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off fortown, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to MissDashwood about it.""""Nay,"" cried Mrs. Jennings, ""I am sure I shall be monstrous glad ofMiss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only themore the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable forthem to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talkto one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.  But one orthe other, if not both of them, I must have.  Lord bless me! how do youthink I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used tillthis winter to have Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let usstrike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change hermind by and bye, why so much the better.""""I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you,"" said Marianne, with warmth:""your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would giveme such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,to be able to accept it.  But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--Ifeel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be madeless happy, less comfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing shouldtempt me to leave her.  It should not, must not be a struggle.""Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could sparethem perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and sawto what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by hereagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther directopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother'sdecision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive anysupport in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could notapprove of for Marianne, and which on her own account she hadparticular reasons to avoid.  Whatever Marianne was desirous of, hermother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to influence thelatter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she hadnever been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared not explainthe motive of her own disinclination for going to London.  ThatMarianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlookevery inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must bemost wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that objectto her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared towitness.On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that suchan excursion would be productive of much amusement to both herdaughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention toherself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear oftheir declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their bothaccepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usualcheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,from this separation.""I am delighted with the plan,"" she cried, ""it is exactly what I couldwish.  Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly andhappily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaretso improved when you come back again!  I have a little plan ofalteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed withoutany inconvenience to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go totown; I would have every young woman of your condition in lifeacquainted with the manners and amusements of London.  You will beunder the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness toyou I can have no doubt.  And in all probability you will see yourbrother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so whollyestranged from each other.""""Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,"" said Elinor, ""youhave been obviating every impediment to the present scheme whichoccurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,cannot be so easily removed.""Marianne's countenance sunk.""And what,"" said Mrs. Dashwood, ""is my dear prudent Elinor going tosuggest?  What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?  Do letme hear a word about the expense of it.""""My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings'sheart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, orwhose protection will give us consequence.""""That is very true,"" replied her mother, ""but of her society,separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thingat all, and you will almost always appear in public with LadyMiddleton.""""If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings,"" saidMarianne, ""at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation.  Ihave no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with everyunpleasantness of that kind with very little effort.""Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towardsthe manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty inpersuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolvedwithin herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would golikewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be leftto the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings shouldbe abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of herdomestic hours.  To this determination she was the more easilyreconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account, wasnot to be in town before February; and that their visit, without anyunreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.""I will have you BOTH go,"" said Mrs. Dashwood; ""these objections arenonsensical.  You will have much pleasure in being in London, andespecially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend toanticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety ofsources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving heracquaintance with her sister-in-law's family.""Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken hermother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that theshock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on thisattack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to beginher design by saying, as calmly as she could, ""I like Edward Ferrarsvery much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest ofthe family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I amever known to them or not.""Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.  Marianne lifted up her eyes inastonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have heldher tongue.After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that theinvitation should be fully accepted.  Mrs. Jennings received theinformation with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindnessand care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John wasdelighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread ofbeing alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants inLondon, was something.  Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of beingdelighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as forthe Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy intheir lives as this intelligence made them.Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes withless reluctance than she had expected to feel.  With regard to herself,it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, andwhen she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and hersister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to allher usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, shecould not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allowherself to distrust the consequence.Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was theperturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone.  Herunwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one ofthe three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short ofeternal.Their departure took place in the first week in January.  TheMiddletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss Steeles kept theirstation at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of thefamily."
Sense & Sensibility,26,"CHAPTER 26Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, andbeginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintancewith that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age anddisposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measureonly a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happyardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, beenovercome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubtof Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightfulexpectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes ofMarianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerlessher own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she wouldengage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation to have the sameanimating object in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, avery short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentionswere; in all probability he was already in town.  Marianne's eagernessto be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor wasresolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his characterwhich her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with suchzealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,before many meetings had taken place.  Should the result of herobservations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to openthe eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would beof a different nature--she must then learn to avoid every selfishcomparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfactionin the happiness of Marianne.They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as theytravelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance andcompanionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.  She sat insilence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcelyever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beautywithin their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusivelyaddressed to her sister.  To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinortook immediate possession of the post of civility which she hadassigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever shecould; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with allpossible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease andenjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose theirown dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferringsalmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.  They reached town bythree o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxuryof a good fire.The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladieswere immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment.  Ithad formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung alandscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her havingspent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from theirarrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to hermother, and sat down for that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne didthe same.  ""I am writing home, Marianne,"" said Elinor; ""had not youbetter defer your letter for a day or two?""""I am NOT going to write to my mother,"" replied Marianne, hastily, andas if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; itimmediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; andthe conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, howevermysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must beengaged.  This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave herpleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be nomore than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed witheager rapidity.  Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in thedirection; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing thebell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyedfor her to the two-penny post.  This decided the matter at once.Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in themwhich prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and thisagitation increased as the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat anydinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemedanxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being muchengaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.  The teathings were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed morethan once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenlyheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinorfelt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne,starting up, moved towards the door.  Every thing was silent; thiscould not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a fewsteps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returnedinto the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heardhim would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at thatinstant she could not help exclaiming, ""Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby,indeed it is!"" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms,when Colonel Brandon appeared.It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediatelyleft the room.  Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time herregard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she feltparticularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceivethat she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeinghim.  She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he evenobserved Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment andconcern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demandedtowards herself.""Is your sister ill?"" said he.Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked ofhead-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to whichshe could decently attribute her sister's behaviour.He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollecthimself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak ofhis pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries abouttheir journey, and the friends they had left behind.In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughtsof both engaged elsewhere.  Elinor wished very much to ask whetherWilloughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain byany enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something,she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last.""Yes,"" he replied, with some embarrassment, ""almost ever since; I havebeen once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been inmy power to return to Barton.""This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back toher remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, withthe uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and shewas fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on thesubject than she had ever felt.Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  ""Oh! Colonel,"" said she, with her usualnoisy cheerfulness, ""I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could notcome before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me alittle, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have beenat home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to doafter one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright tosettle with-- Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in towntoday?""""I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have beendining.""""Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house?  How doesCharlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.""""Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,that you will certainly see her to-morrow.""""Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel, I have brought twoyoung ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,but there is another somewhere.  Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--whichyou will not be sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr.Willoughby will do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing to beyoung and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I never was veryhandsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got a very good husband, and Idon't know what the greatest beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he hasbeen dead these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have youbeen to since we parted?  And how does your business go on?  Come,come, let's have no secrets among friends.""He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, butwithout satisfying her in any.  Elinor now began to make the tea, andMarianne was obliged to appear again.After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silentthan he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him tostay long.  No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies wereunanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in theexpectation of what was to happen that day.  They had not long finishedtheir breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, andin a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to seethem all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasurefrom meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.  So surprised attheir coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected allalong; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after havingdeclined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiventhem if they had not come!""Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,"" said she; ""What do you thinkhe said when he heard of your coming with Mama?  I forget what it wasnow, but it was something so droll!""After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all theiracquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause onMrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should allaccompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, towhich Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewisesome purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it atfirst was induced to go likewise.Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch.  In BondStreet especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were inconstant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mindwas equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from allthat interested and occupied the others.  Restless and dissatisfiedevery where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any articleof purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she receivedno pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, andcould with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away hertime in rapture and indecision.It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner hadthey entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and whenElinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowfulcountenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.""Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?"" said she tothe footman who then entered with the parcels.  She was answered in thenegative.  ""Are you quite sure of it?"" she replied.  ""Are you certainthat no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?""The man replied that none had.""How very odd!"" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as sheturned away to the window.""How odd, indeed!"" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sisterwith uneasiness.  ""If she had not known him to be in town she would nothave written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write!Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagementbetween a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on inso doubtful, so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how willMY interference be borne.""She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continuedmany days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent inthe strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some seriousenquiry into the affair.Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimateacquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined withthem.  The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her eveningengagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist tablefor the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as shewould never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at herown disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasureto her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety ofexpectation and the pain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavouredfor a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and shereturned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards andforwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to thewindow, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap."
Sense & Sensibility,27,"CHAPTER 27""If this open weather holds much longer,"" said Mrs. Jennings, when theymet at breakfast the following morning, ""Sir John will not like leavingBarton next week; 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day'spleasure.  Poor souls!  I always pity them when they do; they seem totake it so much to heart.""""That is true,"" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to thewindow as she spoke, to examine the day.  ""I had not thought of that.This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.""It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.""It is charming weather for THEM indeed,"" she continued, as she satdown to the breakfast table with a happy countenance.  ""How much theymust enjoy it! But"" (with a little return of anxiety) ""it cannot beexpected to last long.  At this time of the year, and after such aseries of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it.  Frostswill soon set in, and in all probability with severity.  In another dayor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay,perhaps it may freeze tonight!""""At any rate,"" said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings fromseeing her sister's thoughts as clearly as she did, ""I dare say weshall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week.""""Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do.  Mary always has her own way.""""And now,"" silently conjectured Elinor, ""she will write to Combe bythis day's post.""But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacywhich eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact.  Whatever thetruth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thoroughcontentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she couldnot be very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits; happyin the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation ofa frost.The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.Jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; andMarianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in theair.""Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? Thereseems to me a very decided difference.  I can hardly keep my hands warmeven in my muff.  It was not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seemparting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clearafternoon.""Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning inthe appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approachingfrost.The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with herbehaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind.  Every thing in herhousehold arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, andexcepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret, shehad never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could atall discompose the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to findherself more comfortably situated in that particular than she hadexpected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much realenjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home orabroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was withthem almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than fromany other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with muchconcern his continued regard for her sister.  She feared it was astrengthening regard.  It grieved her to see the earnestness with whichhe often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse thanwhen at Barton.About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby wasalso arrived.  His card was on the table when they came in from themorning's drive.""Good God!"" cried Marianne, ""he has been here while we were out.""Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured tosay, ""Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow.""  But Marianneseemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped withthe precious card.This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those ofher sister all, and more than all, their former agitation.  From thismoment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him everyhour of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted on beingleft behind, the next morning, when the others went out.Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Streetduring their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister when theyreturned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no secondvisit there.  A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.""For me!"" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.""No, ma'am, for my mistress.""But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.""It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!""""You are expecting a letter, then?"" said Elinor, unable to be longersilent.""Yes, a little--not much.""After a short pause.  ""You have no confidence in me, Marianne.""""Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have confidence in noone!""""Me!"" returned Elinor in some confusion; ""indeed, Marianne, I havenothing to tell.""""Nor I,"" answered Marianne with energy, ""our situations then are alike.We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do notcommunicate, and I, because I conceal nothing.""Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she wasnot at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, topress for greater openness in Marianne.Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read italoud.  It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in ConduitStreet the night before, and requesting the company of her mother andcousins the following evening.  Business on Sir John's part, and aviolent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drewnear, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, thatthey should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficultyin persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing ofWilloughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is notmaterially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settledin town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twentyyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was an affair,however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.  In the country, anunpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where thereputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, itwas risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have itknown that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or ninecouple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they hadnot seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoidthe appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and thereforenever came near her, they received no mark of recognition on theirentrance.  He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who theywere, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of theroom.  Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: itwas enough--HE was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed toreceive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been assembled aboutan hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express hissurprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been firstinformed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself saidsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come.""I thought you were both in Devonshire,"" said he.""Did you?"" replied Elinor.""When do you go back again?""""I do not know."" And thus ended their discourse.Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she wasthat evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise.  Shecomplained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.""Aye, aye,"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""we know the reason of all that verywell; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, youwould not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not verypretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited.""""Invited!"" cried Marianne.""So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met himsomewhere in the street this morning."" Marianne said no more, butlooked exceedingly hurt.  Impatient in this situation to be doingsomething that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved towrite the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fearsfor the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had beenso long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure byperceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was againwriting to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any otherperson.About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself onbusiness, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, toorestless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from onewindow to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating allthat had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging herby every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an accountof her real situation with respect to him.Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, andColonel Brandon was announced.  Marianne, who had seen him from thewindow, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before heentered it.  He looked more than usually grave, and though expressingsatisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat inparticular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which hersister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.  It was not thefirst time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more thanonce before, beginning with the observation of ""your sister looksunwell to-day,"" or ""your sister seems out of spirits,"" he had appearedon the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, somethingparticular about her.  After a pause of several minutes, their silencewas broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he wasto congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was notprepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obligedto adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant?  Hetried to smile as he replied, ""your sister's engagement to Mr.Willoughby is very generally known.""""It cannot be generally known,"" returned Elinor, ""for her own family donot know it.""He looked surprised and said, ""I beg your pardon, I am afraid myinquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecyintended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universallytalked of.""""How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?""""By many--by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you aremost intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.  Butstill I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhapsrather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something tosupport its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby inyour sister's writing.  I came to inquire, but I was convinced before Icould ask the question.  Is every thing finally settled?  Is itimpossible to-?  But I have no right, and I could have no chance ofsucceeding.  Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong insaying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence Ihave the strongest dependence.  Tell me that it is all absolutelyresolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, ifconcealment be possible, is all that remains.""These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love forher sister, affected her very much.  She was not immediately able tosay anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated fora short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.  The realstate of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little knownto herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liableto say too much as too little.  Yet as she was convinced thatMarianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of ColonelBrandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, andat the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thoughtit most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more thanshe really knew or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that thoughshe had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which theystood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, andof their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,""to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that hemay endeavour to deserve her,""--took leave, and went away.Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, tolessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on thecontrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon'sunhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by heranxiety for the very event that must confirm it."
Sense & Sensibility,28,"CHAPTER 28Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinorregret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughbyneither came nor wrote.  They were engaged about the end of that timeto attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was keptaway by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party,Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seemingequally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without onelook of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by thedrawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton'sarrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude,lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's presence; andwhen at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at thedoor, she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon asthe string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended thestairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to anotherin an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite fullof company, and insufferably hot.  When they had paid their tribute ofpoliteness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permittedto mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat andinconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add.  After sometime spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down toCassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she andElinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no greatdistance from the table.They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceivedWilloughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnestconversation with a very fashionable looking young woman.  She sooncaught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting tospeak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her;and then continued his discourse with the same lady.  Elinor turnedinvoluntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved byher.  At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenanceglowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards himinstantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.""Good heavens!"" she exclaimed, ""he is there--he is there--Oh! why doeshe not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?""""Pray, pray be composed,"" cried Elinor, ""and do not betray what youfeel to every body present.  Perhaps he has not observed you yet.""This however was more than she could believe herself; and to becomposed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, itwas beyond her wish.  She sat in an agony of impatience which affectedevery feature.At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up,and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand tohim.  He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor thanMarianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observeher attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, andasked how long they had been in town.  Elinor was robbed of allpresence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word.  Butthe feelings of her sister were instantly expressed.  Her face wascrimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,""Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?  Have you notreceived my letters?  Will you not shake hands with me?""He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and heheld her hand only for a moment.  During all this time he was evidentlystruggling for composure.  Elinor watched his countenance and saw itsexpression becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's pause, he spokewith calmness.""I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to findyourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home.  My card was not lost, I hope.""""But have you not received my notes?"" cried Marianne in the wildestanxiety.  ""Here is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake.  Whatcan be the meaning of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tellme, what is the matter?""He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassmentreturned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom hehad been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion,he recovered himself again, and after saying, ""Yes, I had the pleasureof receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were sogood as to send me,"" turned hastily away with a slight bow and joinedhis friend.Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk intoher chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, triedto screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her withlavender water.""Go to him, Elinor,"" she cried, as soon as she could speak, ""and forcehim to come to me.  Tell him I must see him again--must speak to himinstantly.-- I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till thisis explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to himthis moment.""""How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait.  This isnot the place for explanations.  Wait only till tomorrow.""With difficulty however could she prevent her from following himherself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least,with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with moreprivacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continuedincessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings,by exclamations of wretchedness.  In a short time Elinor saw Willoughbyquit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Mariannethat he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again thatevening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.  She instantly beggedher sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she wastoo miserable to stay a minute longer.Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informedthat Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to herwish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, theydeparted as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word wasspoken during their return to Berkeley Street.  Marianne was in asilent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jenningswas luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,where hartshorn restored her a little to herself.  She was soonundressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, hersister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings,had leisure enough for thinking over the past.That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby andMarianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her ownwishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake ormisapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough change ofsentiment could account for it.  Her indignation would have been stillstronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment whichseemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and preventedher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting withthe affections of her sister from the first, without any design thatwould bear investigation.  Absence might have weakened his regard, andconvenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such aregard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must alreadyhave given her, and on those still more severe which might await her inits probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepestconcern.  Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while shecould ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided infuture, her mind might be always supported.  But every circumstancethat could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the miseryof Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate andirreconcilable rupture with him."
Sense & Sensibility,29,"CHAPTER 29Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or the sungained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, onlyhalf dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sakeof all the little light she could command from it, and writing as fastas a continual flow of tears would permit her.  In this situation,Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceivedher; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety,said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,""Marianne, may I ask-?""""No, Elinor,"" she replied, ""ask nothing; you will soon know all.""The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted nolonger than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a returnof the same excessive affliction.  It was some minutes before she couldgo on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which stillobliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough ofher feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for thelast time to Willoughby.Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; andshe would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had notMarianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervousirritability, not to speak to her for the world.  In suchcircumstances, it was better for both that they should not be longtogether; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only preventedher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, butrequiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made herwander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of everybody.At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; andElinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not inpitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring toengage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself.As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted aconsiderable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,round the common working table, when a letter was delivered toMarianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of adeath-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw asplainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must comefrom Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made herhardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour asmade her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice.  That goodlady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter fromWilloughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which shetreated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it toher liking.  Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed inmeasuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; andcalmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,""Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in mylife!  MY girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolishenough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.  Ihope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her waiting muchlonger, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.Pray, when are they to be married?""Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,trying to smile, replied, ""And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourselfinto a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  Ithought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems toimply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceiveyourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing would surprise memore than to hear of their being going to be married.""""For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so?  Don't weall know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears inlove with each other from the first moment they met?  Did not I seethem together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not Iknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy weddingclothes?  Come, come, this won't do.  Because you are so sly about ityourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no suchthing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever solong.  I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte.""""Indeed, Ma'am,"" said Elinor, very seriously, ""you are mistaken.Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, andyou will find that you have though you will not believe me now.""Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurriedaway to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Mariannestretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,and two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near, but withoutsaying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissedher affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst oftears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. Thelatter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness ofthis behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, sheput all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her facewith her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knewthat such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have itscourse, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spentitself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter, read asfollows:                              ""Bond Street, January.     ""MY DEAR MADAM,     ""I have just had the honour of receiving your     letter, for which I beg to return my sincere     acknowledgments.  I am much concerned to find there     was anything in my behaviour last night that did     not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at     a loss to discover in what point I could be so     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your     forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been     perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect on     my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire     without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or     misapprehension of my actions.  My esteem for your     whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than     I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself     for not having been more guarded in my professions     of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,     and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before     this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great     regret that I obey your commands in returning the     letters with which I have been honoured from you,     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed     on me.     ""I am, dear Madam,               ""Your most obedient                    ""humble servant,                                        ""JOHN WILLOUGHBY.""With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by MissDashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware, before she began it, that itmust bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm theirseparation for ever, she was not aware that such language could besuffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capableof departing so far from the appearance of every honourable anddelicate feeling--so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as tosend a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringingwith his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged nobreach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--a letter ofwhich every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to bedeep in hardened villainy.She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then readit again and again; but every perusal only served to increase herabhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him,that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might woundMarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss toher of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and mostirremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipledman, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on thedepravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on thevery different mind of a very different person, who had no otherconnection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him withevery thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of hersister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and soentirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearinga carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see whocould be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment toperceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been orderedtill one.  Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless ofcontributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuseherself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister beingindisposed.  Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern forits cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeingher safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to risefrom the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her fromfalling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper restand food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and manynights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no longersupported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this wasfelt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervousfaintness.  A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express somesense of her kindness, by saying,""Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!""""I only wish,"" replied her sister, ""there were any thing I COULD do,which might be of comfort to you.""This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, ""Oh! Elinor, I ammiserable, indeed,"" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief insilence.""Exert yourself, dear Marianne,"" she cried, ""if you would not killyourself and all who love you.  Think of your mother; think of hermisery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself.""""I cannot, I cannot,"" cried Marianne; ""leave me, leave me, if Idistress you; leave me, hate me, forget me!  but do not torture me so.Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk ofexertion!  Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what Isuffer.""""Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  Ah! if you knew!--And can you believeme to be so, while I see you so wretched!""""Forgive me, forgive me,"" throwing her arms round her sister's neck; ""Iknow you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet youare--you must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do awaysuch happiness as that?""""Many, many circumstances,"" said Elinor, solemnly.""No, no, no,"" cried Marianne wildly, ""he loves you, and only you.  YouCAN have no grief.""""I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state.""""And you will never see me otherwise.  Mine is a misery which nothingcan do away.""""You must not talk so, Marianne.  Have you no comforts? no friends?  Isyour loss such as leaves no opening for consolation?  Much as yousuffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery ofhis character had been delayed to a later period--if your engagementhad been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,before he chose to put an end to it.  Every additional day of unhappyconfidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful.""""Engagement!"" cried Marianne, ""there has been no engagement.""""No engagement!""""No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.  He has broken no faithwith me.""""But he told you that he loved you.""""Yes--no--never absolutely.  It was every day implied, but neverprofessedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it had been--but it neverwas.""""Yet you wrote to him?""--""Yes--could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I cannottalk.""Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which nowraised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over thecontents of all.  The first, which was what her sister had sent him ontheir arrival in town, was to this effect.                         Berkeley Street, January.     ""How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on     receiving this; and I think you will feel something     more than surprise, when you know that I am in town.     An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs.     Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.     I wish you may receive this in time to come here     to-night, but I will not depend on it.  At any rate     I shall expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.                                             ""M.D.""Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the danceat the Middletons', was in these words:--     ""I cannot express my disappointment in having     missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment     at not having received any answer to a note which     I sent you above a week ago.  I have been expecting     to hear from you, and still more to see you, every     hour of the day.  Pray call again as soon as possible,     and explain the reason of my having expected this     in vain.  You had better come earlier another time,     because we are generally out by one.  We were last     night at Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance.     I have been told that you were asked to be of the     party.  But could it be so?  You must be very much     altered indeed since we parted, if that could be     the case, and you not there.  But I will not suppose     this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your     personal assurance of its being otherwise.                                            ""M.D.""The contents of her last note to him were these:--     ""What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your     behaviour last night?  Again I demand an explanation     of it.  I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure     which our separation naturally produced, with the     familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared     to me to justify.  I was repulsed indeed! I have     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than     insulting; but though I have not yet been able to     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,     I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of     it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely     deceived, in something concerning me, which may have     lowered me in your opinion.  Tell me what it is,     explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall     be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  It     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill     of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that     you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that     your regard for us all was insincere, that your     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let     it be told as soon as possible.  My feelings are at     present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish     to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be     ease to what I now suffer.  If your sentiments are     no longer what they were, you will return my notes,     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.                                             ""M.D.""That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have beenso answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake, would have been unwillingto believe.  But her condemnation of him did not blind her to theimpropriety of their having been written at all; and she was silentlygrieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofsof tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severelycondemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finishedthe letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what anyone would have written in the same situation.""I felt myself,"" she added, ""to be as solemnly engaged to him, as ifthe strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other.""""I can believe it,"" said Elinor; ""but unfortunately he did not feel thesame.""""He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he felt it.  I knowhe did.  Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but theblackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dearto him as my own soul could wish.  This lock of hair, which now he canso readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnestsupplication.  Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard hisvoice at that moment!  Have you forgot the last evening of our beingtogether at Barton?  The morning that we parted too!  When he told methat it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can Iever forget his distress?""For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion hadpassed away, she added, in a firmer tone,""Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby.""""Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he have beeninstigated?""""By all the world, rather than by his own heart.  I could ratherbelieve every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin mein his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty.  Thiswoman of whom he writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but yourown dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me.Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would notrather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?""Elinor would not contend, and only replied, ""Whoever may have been sodetestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your owninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits.  It is areasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence.""""No, no,"" cried Marianne, ""misery such as mine has no pride.  I carenot who knows that I am wretched.  The triumph of seeing me so may beopen to all the world.  Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may beproud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or returnmortification--but I cannot.  I must feel--I must be wretched--and theyare welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can.""""But for my mother's sake and mine--""""I would do more than for my own.  But to appear happy when I am somiserable--Oh! who can require it?""Again they were both silent.  Elinor was employed in walkingthoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerningobjects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took upWilloughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,exclaimed--""It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor, nothing can.  Whateverhe might have heard against me--ought he not to have suspended hisbelief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the powerof clearing myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable.Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?  Oh,barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?""""No, Marianne, in no possible way.""""And yet this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long itmay have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who isshe?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young andattractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one--hetalked to me only of myself.""Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.""Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.  Can not we begone to-morrow?""""To-morrow, Marianne!""""Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby's sake--andnow who cares for me? Who regards me?""""It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much morethan civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such ahasty removal as that.""""Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, Icannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.The Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?  The pity ofsuch a woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE say to that!""Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; butno attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and bodyshe moved from one posture to another, till growing more and morehysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed atall, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call forassistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she was at lengthpersuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jenningsreturned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless."
Sense & Sensibility,30,"CHAPTER 30Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and withoutwaiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the door andwalked in with a look of real concern.""How do you do my dear?""--said she in a voice of great compassion toMarianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.""How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she looks very bad.-- Nowonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He is to be married very soon--agood-for-nothing fellow!  I have no patience with him.  Mrs. Taylortold me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particularfriend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believedit; and I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I, all I cansay is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of myacquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife mayplague his heart out.  And so I shall always say, my dear, you maydepend on it.  I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and ifever I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has nothad this many a day.  But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne;he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with yourpretty face you will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I won'tdisturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once andhave done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonightyou know, and that will amuse her.""She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if shesupposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise.Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining withthem.  Elinor even advised her against it.  But ""no, she would go down;she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less.""Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her intothe dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmerthan her sister had expected.  Had she tried to speak, or had she beenconscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentionsto her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not asyllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughtspreserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though itseffusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, madeher those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which hersister could not make or return for herself.  Their good friend sawthat Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to herwhich might make her at all less so.  She treated her therefore, withall the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on thelast day of its holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by thefire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and tobe amused by the relation of all the news of the day.  Had not Elinor,in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, shecould have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure adisappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and agood fire.  As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this wasforced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer.With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not tofollow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.""Poor soul!"" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, ""how itgrieves me to see her!  And I declare if she is not gone away withoutfinishing her wine!  And the dried cherries too!  Lord! nothing seemsto do her any good.  I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, Iwould send all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest thing tome, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill!  But when there isplenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord blessyou! they care no more about such things!--""""The lady then--Miss Grey I think you called her--is very rich?""""Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see her? a smart,stylish girl they say, but not handsome.  I remember her aunt verywell, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man.  But the familyare all rich together.  Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, itwon't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.  Nowonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!  Well, it don'tsignify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makeslove to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to flyoff from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl isready to have him.  Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, lethis house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? Iwarrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matterscame round.  But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way ofpleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age.""""Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?  Is she said to beamiable?""""I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard hermentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one dayMiss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison wouldnot be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison couldnever agree.""--""And who are the Ellisons?""""Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age and may choose forherself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now,"" after pausing amoment--""your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moanby herself.  Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well, by-and-by we shallhave a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.  What shall weplay at?  She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she caresfor?""""Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.  Marianne, I dare say,will not leave her room again this evening.  I shall persuade her if Ican to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest.""""Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her name her ownsupper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad andso cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has beenhanging over her head as long as that.  And so the letter that cametoday finished it!  Poor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,I would not have joked her about it for all my money.  But then youknow, how should I guess such a thing?  I made sure of its beingnothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to belaughed at about them.  Lord!  how concerned Sir John and my daughterswill be when they hear it!  If I had my senses about me I might havecalled in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.  But Ishall see them tomorrow.""""It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer andSir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightestallusion to what has passed, before my sister.  Their own good-naturemust point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thingabout it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said tomyself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you mydear madam will easily believe.""""Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  It must be terrible for you to hearit talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention aword about it to her for the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all verythoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as Icertainly will.  For my part, I think the less that is said about suchthings, the better, the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot.  And whatdoes talking ever do you know?""""In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many casesof a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, forthe sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become thepublic conversation.  I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby--he hasbroken no positive engagement with my sister.""""Law, my dear!  Don't pretend to defend him.  No positive engagementindeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on thevery rooms they were to live in hereafter!""Elinor, for her sister's sake, could not press the subject farther, andshe hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby's; since, thoughMarianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcementof the real truth.  After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.""Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will beall the better for Colonel Brandon.  He will have her at last; aye,that he will.  Mind me, now, if they an't married by Mid-summer.  Lord!how he'll chuckle over this news!  I hope he will come tonight.  Itwill be all to one a better match for your sister.  Two thousand a yearwithout debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, Ihad forgot her; but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and thenwhat does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts andconveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are coveredwith the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree inone corner!  Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we werethere!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and avery pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a milefrom the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and situp in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriagesthat pass along.  Oh! 'tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in thevillage, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw.  To my fancy,a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced tosend three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer thanyour mother.  Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.  If we CAN butput Willoughby out of her head!""""Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am,"" said Elinor, ""we shall do very wellwith or without Colonel Brandon."" And then rising, she went away tojoin Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,till Elinor's entrance, had been her only light.""You had better leave me,"" was all the notice that her sister receivedfrom her.""I will leave you,"" said Elinor, ""if you will go to bed."" But this,from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at firstrefused to do.  Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion,however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay heraching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quietrest before she left her.In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined byMrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.""My dear,"" said she, entering, ""I have just recollected that I havesome of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever wastasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister.  My poorhusband! how fond he was of it!  Whenever he had a touch of his oldcolicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in theworld.  Do take it to your sister.""""Dear Ma'am,"" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of thecomplaints for which it was recommended, ""how good you are!  But I havejust left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I thinknothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give meleave, I will drink the wine myself.""Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutesearlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as sheswallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on acolicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healingpowers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herselfas on her sister.Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his mannerof looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied thathe neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that hewas already aware of what occasioned her absence.  Mrs. Jennings wasnot struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walkedacross the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--""The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows nothing of it;do tell him, my dear.""He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a lookwhich perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after hersister.""Marianne is not well,"" said she.  ""She has been indisposed all day,and we have persuaded her to go to bed.""""Perhaps, then,"" he hesitatingly replied, ""what I heard this morningmay be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible atfirst.""""What did you hear?""""That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man,whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I tell you?  If you know italready, as surely you must, I may be spared.""""You mean,"" answered Elinor, with forced calmness, ""Mr. Willoughby'smarriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO know it all.  This seems to havebeen a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfoldedit to us.  Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?""""In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business.  Two ladieswere waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the otheran account of the intended match, in a voice so little attemptingconcealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The nameof Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught myattention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thingwas now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it wasno longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks,with many particulars of preparations and other matters.  One thing,especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man stillmore:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to CombeMagna, his seat in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but it would beimpossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative lady I learnt,on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs.Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of MissGrey's guardian.""""It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousandpounds?  In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation.""""It may be so; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think""--he stoppeda moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, ""Andyour sister--how did she--""""Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have only to hope that theymay be proportionately short.  It has been, it is a most cruelaffliction.  Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard;and even now, perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never wasreally attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and, in somepoints, there seems a hardness of heart about him.""""Ah!"" said Colonel Brandon, ""there is, indeed!  But your sister doesnot--I think you said so--she does not consider quite as you do?""""You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would stilljustify him if she could.""He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of thetea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject wasnecessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasurewhile they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of MissDashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on ColonelBrandon's side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, ofhope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole eveningmore serious and thoughtful than usual."
Sense & Sensibility,31,"CHAPTER 31From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke thenext morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she hadclosed her eyes.Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; andbefore breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again andagain; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel onElinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions onMarianne's, as before.  Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be asunfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost everyconsolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.  At one moment shewas absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, atanother she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a thirdcould resist it with energy.  In one thing, however, she was uniform,when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, thepresence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged toendure it.  Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs.Jennings's entering into her sorrows with any compassion.""No, no, no, it cannot be,"" she cried; ""she cannot feel.  Her kindnessis not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wantsis gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.""Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which hersister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritablerefinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by heron the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polishedmanner.  Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there bethat are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and anexcellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid.  She expectedfrom other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and shejudged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions onherself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were togetherin their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs.Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her ownweakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, thoughMrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room, saying,""Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.""Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination placed before hera letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; andinstantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the roomto inforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurancesof his letter.  The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.  Thehand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her;and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such anecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she hadnever suffered.The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her reach in hermoments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she couldreproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes withpassionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on itsobject, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, stillreferring her to the letter of comfort.  But the letter, when she wascalm enough to read it, brought little comfort.  Willoughby filledevery page.  Her mother, still confident of their engagement, andrelying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused byElinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towardsthem both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affectionfor Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in eachother, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother wasdearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistakenconfidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone.Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianneto be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except ofpatience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at length sheobtained her sister's consent to wait for that knowledge.Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easytill the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone forthe rest of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of thepain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne'sletter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, thensat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreather directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into thedrawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the tablewhere Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving overher for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondlyover its effect on her mother.In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, whenMarianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, wasstartled by a rap at the door.""Who can this be?"" cried Elinor.  ""So early too! I thought we HAD beensafe.""Marianne moved to the window--""It is Colonel Brandon!"" said she, with vexation.  ""We are never safefrom HIM.""""He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.""""I will not trust to THAT,"" retreating to her own room.  ""A man who hasnothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion onthat of others.""The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded oninjustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, whowas convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and whosaw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in hisanxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive her sisterfor esteeming him so lightly.""I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street,"" said he, after the firstsalutation, ""and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the moreeasily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find youalone, which I was very desirous of doing.  My object--my wish--my solewish in desiring it--I hope, I believe it is--is to be a means ofgiving comfort;--no, I must not say comfort--not present comfort--butconviction, lasting conviction to your sister's mind.  My regard forher, for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it, byrelating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincereregard--nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--I think I amjustified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincingmyself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may bewrong?"" He stopped.""I understand you,"" said Elinor.  ""You have something to tell me of Mr.Willoughby, that will open his character farther.  Your telling it willbe the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne.  MYgratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending tothat end, and HERS must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let mehear it.""""You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,--butthis will give you no idea--I must go farther back.  You will find me avery awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  Ashort account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it SHALL bea short one.  On such a subject,"" sighing heavily, ""can I have littletemptation to be diffuse.""He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, wenton.""You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--(it is not to besupposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversationbetween us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of adance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, insome measure, your sister Marianne.""""Indeed,"" answered Elinor, ""I have NOT forgotten it."" He looked pleasedby this remembrance, and added,""If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tenderrecollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as wellin mind as person.  The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness offancy and spirits.  This lady was one of my nearest relations, anorphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.  Ourages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we wereplayfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the time when I did notlove Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, asperhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, youmight think me incapable of having ever felt.  Hers, for me, was, Ibelieve, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby andit was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.  Atseventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was married--marriedagainst her inclination to my brother.  Her fortune was large, and ourfamily estate much encumbered.  And this, I fear, is all that can besaid for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.  I had hopedthat her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and forsome time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for sheexperienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and thoughshe had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate!  I havenever told you how this was brought on.  We were within a few hours ofeloping together for Scotland.  The treachery, or the folly, of mycousin's maid betrayed us.  I was banished to the house of a relationfar distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her fortitude toofar, and the blow was a severe one--but had her marriage been happy, soyoung as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or atleast I should not have now to lament it.  This however was not thecase.  My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not whatthey ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly.The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, soinexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  She resignedherself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had itbeen if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which theremembrance of me occasioned.  But can we wonder that, with such ahusband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise orrestrain her (for my father lived only a few months after theirmarriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she shouldfall?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote thehappiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purposehad procured my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,""he continued, in a voice of great agitation, ""was of triflingweight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two yearsafterwards, of her divorce.  It was THAT which threw this gloom,--evennow the recollection of what I suffered--""He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes aboutthe room.  Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by hisdistress, could not speak.  He saw her concern, and coming to her, tookher hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.  A fewminutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.""It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returnedto England.  My first care, when I DID arrive, was of course to seekfor her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.  I couldnot trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason tofear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life ofsin.  Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, norsufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from mybrother that the power of receiving it had been made over some monthsbefore to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her todispose of it for some immediate relief.  At last, however, and after Ihad been six months in England, I DID find her.  Regard for a formerservant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me tovisit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; andthere, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunatesister.  So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering of everykind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure beforeme, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whomI had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding her--but I have noright to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I havepained you too much already.  That she was, to all appearance, in thelast stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was mygreatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving timefor a better preparation for death; and that was given.  I saw herplaced in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visitedher every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in herlast moments.""Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings inan exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend.""Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended,"" said he, ""by the resemblanceI have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.  Theirfates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweetdisposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happiermarriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the otherbe.  But to what does all this lead?  I seem to have been distressingyou for nothing.  Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouchedfor fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!  I WILL bemore collected--more concise.  She left to my care her only child, alittle girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was thenabout three years old.  She loved the child, and had always kept itwith her.  It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would Ihave discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over hereducation myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but Ihad no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed atschool.  I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of mybrother, (which happened about five years ago, and which left to me thepossession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford.  Icalled her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have ingeneral been suspected of a much nearer connection with her.  It is nowthree years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that Iremoved her from school, to place her under the care of a veryrespectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of fouror five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years Ihad every reason to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.  I had allowedher, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire,to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending herfather there for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved, for, witha most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, wouldgive no clue, though she certainly knew all.  He, her father, awell-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house,while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintancethey chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he wasconvinced himself, of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in thebusiness.  In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; allthe rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.  What Ithought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too.""""Good heavens!"" cried Elinor, ""could it be--could Willoughby!""--""The first news that reached me of her,"" he continued, ""came in aletter from herself, last October.  It was forwarded to me fromDelaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended partyto Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,and which I believe gave offence to some.  Little did Mr. Willoughbyimagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility inbreaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whomhe had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it, what would it haveavailed?  Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles ofyour sister?  No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feelfor another would do.  He had left the girl whose youth and innocencehe had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with nocreditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address!  He hadleft her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, norrelieved her.""""This is beyond every thing!"" exclaimed Elinor.""His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse thanboth.  Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess whatI must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and onbeing assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have feltfor all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and found you alone,I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do whenit WAS known.  My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; butnow you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be so deceived; tosee your sister--but what could I do?  I had no hope of interferingwith success; and sometimes I thought your sister's influence might yetreclaim him.  But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell whatwere his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been, however, she maynow, and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her owncondition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when sheconsiders the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, andpictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still asstrong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, whichmust attend her through life.  Surely this comparison must have its usewith her.  She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  Theyproceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.  On thecontrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them.Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it,must strengthen every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however, incommunicating to her what I have told you.  You must know best whatwill be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believedit might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not havesuffered myself to trouble you with this account of my familyafflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended toraise myself at the expense of others.""Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage toMarianne, from the communication of what had passed.""I have been more pained,"" said she, ""by her endeavors to acquit himthan by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the mostperfect conviction of his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at firstshe will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.  Haveyou,"" she continued, after a short silence, ""ever seen Mr. Willoughbysince you left him at Barton?""""Yes,"" he replied gravely, ""once I have.  One meeting was unavoidable.""Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying,""What? have you met him to--""""I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed to me, though mostreluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, whichwas within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he todefend, I to punish his conduct.  We returned unwounded, and themeeting, therefore, never got abroad.""Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and asoldier she presumed not to censure it.""Such,"" said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, ""has been the unhappyresemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectlyhave I discharged my trust!""""Is she still in town?""""No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her nearher delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and thereshe remains.""Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinorfrom her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her againthe same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassionand esteem for him."
Sense & Sensibility,32,"CHAPTER 32When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by MissDashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her wasnot entirely such as the former had hoped to see.  Not that Marianneappeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened toit all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neitherobjection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, andseemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible.  Butthough this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guiltWAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction theeffect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind ofcompassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violentlyirritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.  Her mind didbecome settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.  She felt theloss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt theloss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, themisery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCEhave been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, thatshe could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor;and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sisterthan could have been communicated by the most open and most frequentconfession of them.To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving andanswering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of whather daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardlyless painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater thanElinor's.  Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express heranxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up withfortitude under this misfortune.  Bad indeed must the nature ofMarianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, whichSHE could wish her not to indulge!Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood haddetermined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, atthat time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would bebringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, byconstantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seenhim there.  She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by allmeans not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which,though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise atleast five or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, of objects, and ofcompany, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitablethere, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into someinterest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as theideas of both might now be spurned by her.From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered herto be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since hisacquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves herfriends.  Design could never bring them in each other's way: negligencecould never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less inits favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement ofBarton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit atAllenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at firstas a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain wherethey were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and hiswife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judgedit right that they should sometimes see their brother.Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion, and shesubmitted to it therefore without opposition, though it provedperfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she feltit to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that byrequiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the onlypossible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of hermother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must preventher ever knowing a moment's rest.But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evilto herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the otherhand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edwardentirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer staywould therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be betterfor Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby'sname mentioned, was not thrown away.  Marianne, though without knowingit herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, norSir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towardsherself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen dayafter day to the indignation of them all.Sir John, could not have thought it possible.  ""A man of whom he hadalways had such reason to think well!  Such a good-natured fellow!  Hedid not believe there was a bolder rider in England!  It was anunaccountable business.  He wished him at the devil with all his heart.He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, forall the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,and they were kept watching for two hours together.  Such a scoundrelof a fellow! such a deceitful dog!  It was only the last time they metthat he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! and this was the end ofit!""Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry.  ""She was determined todrop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that shehad never been acquainted with him at all.  She wished with all herheart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so muchthat she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she shouldtell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was.""The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all theparticulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicatingthem to Elinor.  She could soon tell at what coachmaker's the newcarriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait wasdrawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was ahappy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by theclamorous kindness of the others.  It was a great comfort to her to besure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circleof friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meether without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety forher sister's health.Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of themoment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried downby officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable tocomfort than good-nature.Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, ""It is veryshocking, indeed!"" and by the means of this continual though gentlevent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the firstwithout the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them withoutrecollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported thedignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what waswrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to theinterest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though ratheragainst the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at oncebe a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soonas she married.Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcometo Miss Dashwood.  He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimatediscussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal withwhich he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed withconfidence.  His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosingpast sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eyewith which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of hervoice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, orcould oblige herself to speak to him.  THESE assured him that hisexertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, andTHESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; butMrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that theColonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevailon him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it forhim, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead ofMidsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end ofa week that it would not be a match at all.  The good understandingbetween the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that thehonours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would allbe made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased tothink at all of Mrs. Ferrars.Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby'sletter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that hewas married.  She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed toherself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she wasdesirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it fromthe public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation onit, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burstout, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly lesspitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor nowhoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, toprevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blowfirst fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin'shouse in Bartlett's Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves againbefore their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; andwere welcomed by them all with great cordiality.Elinor only was sorry to see them.  Their presence always gave herpain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to theoverpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town.""I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you hereSTILL,"" said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.  ""ButI always thought I SHOULD.  I was almost sure you would not leaveLondon yet awhile; though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that youshould not stay above a MONTH.  But I thought, at the time, that youwould most likely change your mind when it came to the point.  It wouldhave been such a great pity to have went away before your brother andsister came.  And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.  Iam amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD.""Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all herself-command to make it appear that she did NOT.""Well, my dear,"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""and how did you travel?""""Not in the stage, I assure you,"" replied Miss Steele, with quickexultation; ""we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau toattend us.  Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we'd joinhim in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten ortwelve shillings more than we did.""""Oh, oh!"" cried Mrs. Jennings; ""very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor isa single man, I warrant you.""""There now,"" said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, ""everybody laughsat me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why.  My cousins say theyare sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I neverthink about him from one hour's end to another.  'Lord! here comes yourbeau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day, when she saw him crossing thestreet to the house.  My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who youmean.  The Doctor is no beau of mine.""""Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won't do--the Doctor isthe man, I see.""""No, indeed!"" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, ""and I begyou will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.""Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that shecertainly would NOT, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.""I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, MissDashwood, when they come to town,"" said Lucy, returning, after acessation of hostile hints, to the charge.""No, I do not think we shall.""""Oh, yes, I dare say you will.""Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.""What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both forso long a time together!""""Long a time, indeed!"" interposed Mrs. Jennings.  ""Why, their visit isbut just begun!""Lucy was silenced.""I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood,"" said MissSteele.  ""I am sorry she is not well--"" for Marianne had left the roomon their arrival.""You are very good.  My sister will be equally sorry to miss thepleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately withnervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation.""""Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy andme!--I think she might see US; and I am sure we would not speak a word.""Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.  Her sister wasperhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and thereforenot able to come to them.""Oh, if that's all,"" cried Miss Steele, ""we can just as well go and seeHER.""Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but shewas saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy's sharp reprimand, whichnow, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to themanners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other."
Sense & Sensibility,33,"CHAPTER 33After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties, andconsented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half anhour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, andwould do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street,where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a fewold-fashioned jewels of her mother.When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there wasa lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and asshe had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her youngfriends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return forthem.On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people beforethem in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend totheir orders; and they were obliged to wait.  All that could be donewas, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise thequickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it isprobable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness toa quicker despatch.  But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacyof his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.  He was giving ordersfor a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, andornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debatingfor a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, werefinally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure tobestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprisedin three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served toimprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong,natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style offashion.Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt andresentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and onthe puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors ofthe different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remainingunconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughtswithin herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, inMr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.At last the affair was decided.  The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the lastday on which his existence could be continued without the possession ofthe toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, andbestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one asseemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with ahappy air of real conceit and affected indifference.Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the pointof concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surpriseto be her brother.Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a verycreditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop.  John Dashwood was really farfrom being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave themsatisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful andattentive.Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.""I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,"" said he, ""but it wasimpossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts atExeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.Harry was vastly pleased.  THIS morning I had fully intended to call onyou, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always somuch to do on first coming to town.  I am come here to bespeak Fanny aseal.  But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call inBerkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.  Iunderstand she is a woman of very good fortune.  And the Middletonstoo, you must introduce me to THEM.  As my mother-in-law's relations, Ishall be happy to show them every respect.  They are excellentneighbours to you in the country, I understand.""""Excellent indeed.  Their attention to our comfort, their friendlinessin every particular, is more than I can express.""""I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they arerelated to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve tomake your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.  And so youare most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want fornothing!  Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: themost complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you allseemed to enjoy it beyond any thing.  It was a great satisfaction to usto hear it, I assure you.""Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry tobe spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.Jennings's servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited forthem at the door.Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jenningsat the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being able tocall on them the next day, took leave.His visit was duly paid.  He came with a pretence at an apology fromtheir sister-in-law, for not coming too; ""but she was so much engagedwith her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where.""Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not standupon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and sheshould certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring hersisters to see her.  His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectlykind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on ColonelBrandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiositywhich seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to beequally civil to HIM.After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with himto Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon asthey were out of the house, his enquiries began.""Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he a man of fortune?""""Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.""""I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectableestablishment in life.""""Me, brother! what do you mean?""""He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it.  Whatis the amount of his fortune?""""I believe about two thousand a year.""""Two thousand a-year;"" and then working himself up to a pitch ofenthusiastic generosity, he added, ""Elinor, I wish with all my heart itwere TWICE as much, for your sake.""""Indeed I believe you,"" replied Elinor; ""but I am very sure thatColonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME.""""You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.  A very littletrouble on your side secures him.  Perhaps just at present he may beundecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; hisfriends may all advise him against it.  But some of those littleattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fixhim, in spite of himself.  And there can be no reason why you shouldnot try for him.  It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment onyour side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it isquite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you havetoo much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon must be the man;and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased withyou and your family.  It is a match that must give universalsatisfaction.  In short, it is a kind of thing that""--lowering hisvoice to an important whisper--""will be exceedingly welcome to ALLPARTIES."" Recollecting himself, however, he added, ""That is, I mean tosay--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fannyparticularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assureyou.  And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I amsure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day.""Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.""It would be something remarkable, now,"" he continued, ""somethingdroll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at thesame time.  And yet it is not very unlikely.""""Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,"" said Elinor, with resolution, ""going to bemarried?""""It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.He has a most excellent mother.  Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmostliberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, ifthe match takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughterof the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.  A very desirableconnection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place intime.  A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, tomake over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give youanother instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we cameto town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,she put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundredpounds.  And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a greatexpense while we are here.""He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say,""Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable;but your income is a large one.""""Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.  I do not mean tocomplain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope willin time be better.  The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little purchase withinthis half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, whereold Gibson used to live.  The land was so very desirable for me inevery respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt itmy duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my conscience tolet it fall into any other hands.  A man must pay for his convenience;and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money.""""More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.""""Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again, the next day, formore than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might havebeen very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker'shands, I must have sold out to very great loss.""Elinor could only smile.""Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming toNorland.  Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all theStanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had anundoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, inconsequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases oflinen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.  You mayguess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from beingrich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is.""""Certainly,"" said Elinor; ""and assisted by her liberality, I hope youmay yet live to be in easy circumstances.""""Another year or two may do much towards it,"" he gravely replied; ""buthowever there is still a great deal to be done.  There is not a stonelaid of Fanny's green-house, and nothing but the plan of theflower-garden marked out.""""Where is the green-house to be?""""Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old walnut trees are all comedown to make room for it.  It will be a very fine object from manyparts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just beforeit, and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old thornsthat grew in patches over the brow.""Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was verythankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away thenecessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in hisnext visit at Gray's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he beganto congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.""She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house, her style ofliving, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintancethat has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end mayprove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly avast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great aregard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not beforgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave.""""Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only herjointure, which will descend to her children.""""But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income.  Fewpeople of common prudence will do THAT; and whatever she saves, shewill be able to dispose of.""""And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to herdaughters, than to us?""""Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore Icannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, andtreating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim onher future consideration, which a conscientious woman would notdisregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she canhardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.""""But she raises none in those most concerned.  Indeed, brother, youranxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.""""Why, to be sure,"" said he, seeming to recollect himself, ""people havelittle, have very little in their power.  But, my dear Elinor, what isthe matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,and is grown quite thin.  Is she ill?""""She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for severalweeks.""""I am sorry for that.  At her time of life, any thing of an illnessdestroys the bloom for ever!  Hers has been a very short one!  She wasas handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely toattract the man.  There was something in her style of beauty, to pleasethem particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say that she would marrysooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond ofYOU, but so it happened to strike her.  She will be mistaken, however.I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than fiveor six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived ifYOU do not do better.  Dorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire;but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among theearliest and best pleased of your visitors.""Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was nolikelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectationof too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was reallyresolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting themarriage by every possible attention.  He had just compunction enoughfor having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedinglyanxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer fromColonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest meansof atoning for his own neglect.They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir Johncame in before their visit ended.  Abundance of civilities passed onall sides.  Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwooddid not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a verygood-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in hisappearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwoodwent away delighted with both.""I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,"" said he, as hewalked back with his sister.  ""Lady Middleton is really a most elegantwoman!  Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.  And Mrs.Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegantas her daughter.  Your sister need not have any scruple even ofvisiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, andvery naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of aman who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrarswere both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughterswere such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with.  But nowI can carry her a most satisfactory account of both."""
Sense & Sensibility,34,"CHAPTER 34Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment,that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and herdaughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthyher notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the mostcharming women in the world!Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.  There was akind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutuallyattracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipidpropriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to thegood opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking womanof uncordial address, who met her husband's sisters without anyaffection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for ofthe quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at leastseven minutes and a half in silence.Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask,whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fannyvoluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her thathis marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband'sexpectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believedthem still so very much attached to each other, that they could not betoo sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.  Theintelligence however, which SHE would not give, soon flowed fromanother quarter.  Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassionon being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.and Mrs. Dashwood.  He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fearof detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to betold, they could do nothing at present but write.Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very shorttime, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.  Twice was his card found onthe table, when they returned from their morning's engagements.  Elinorwas pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she hadmissed him.The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined togive them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invitedthem to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good housefor three months.  Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invitedlikewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eagercivilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.  They were tomeet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were tobe of the party.  The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough tomake her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meetEdward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised toattend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfectindifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being incompany with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, wasas lively as ever.The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soonafterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearingthat the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeablehad their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainlynot so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready asSir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and ithappened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon asthe Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin afew days before the party took place.Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of thegentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might nothave done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; butas Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had longwanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view oftheir characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunityof endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began immediately todetermine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as hismother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for thefirst time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardlyknew how she could bear it!These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, andcertainly not at all on truth.  They were relieved however, not by herown recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself tobe inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edwardcertainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped tobe carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was keptaway by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not concealwhen they were together.The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladiesto this formidable mother-in-law.""Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!"" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairstogether--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,that they all followed the servant at the same time--""There is nobodyhere but you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all myhappiness depends on--that is to be my mother!""--Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting thepossibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own,whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assuredher, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utteramazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped atleast to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, inher figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect.  Hercomplexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, andnaturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow hadrescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving itthe strong characters of pride and ill nature.  She was not a woman ofmany words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to thenumber of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her, notone fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spiriteddetermination of disliking her at all events.Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few monthsago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars'power to distress her by it now;--and the difference of her manners tothe Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humbleher more, only amused her.  She could not but smile to see thegraciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- forLucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others, had they knownas much as she did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; whileshe herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, satpointedly slighted by both.  But while she smiled at a graciousness somisapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from whichit sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the MissSteeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them allfour.Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and MissSteele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thingbespoke the Mistress's inclination for show, and the Master's abilityto support it.  In spite of the improvements and additions which weremaking to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having oncebeen within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at aloss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried toinfer from it;--no poverty of any kind, except of conversation,appeared--but there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwoodhad not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wifehad still less.  But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it wasvery much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost alllaboured under one or other of these disqualifications for beingagreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want ofelegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this povertywas particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discoursewith some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land, andbreaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only engagedthe ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights ofHarry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William, who werenearly of the same age.Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determinedtoo easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, itwas all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a rightto be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and overagain as often as they liked.The parties stood thus:The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was thetallest, politely decided in favour of the other.The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity,were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could notconceive that there could be the smallest difference in the worldbetween them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, asfast as she could, in favour of each.Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William's side, by whichshe offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see thenecessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, whencalled on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had noopinion to give, as she had never thought about it.Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pairof screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted andbrought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemeninto the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon forhis admiration.""These are done by my eldest sister,"" said he; ""and you, as a man oftaste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.  I do not know whetheryou have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but sheis in general reckoned to draw extremely well.""The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted byMiss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of courseexcited, they were handed round for general inspection.  Mrs. Ferrars,not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to lookat them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of LadyMiddletons's approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done byMiss Dashwood.""Hum""--said Mrs. Ferrars--""very pretty,""--and without regarding them atall, returned them to her daughter.Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rudeenough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said,""They are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?"" But then again, the dread ofhaving been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her,for she presently added,""Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton's style ofpainting, Ma'am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifullyher last landscape is done!""""Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well.""Marianne could not bear this.--She was already greatly displeased withMrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor'sexpense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant byit, provoked her immediately to say with warmth,""This is admiration of a very particular kind!--what is Miss Morton tous?--who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE thinkand speak.""And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands,to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up morestiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, ""MissMorton is Lord Morton's daughter.""Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at hissister's audacity.  Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth thanshe had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as theywere fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiablein it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sisterslighted in the smallest point.Marianne's feelings did not stop here.  The cold insolence of Mrs.Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretellsuch difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded hearttaught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse ofaffectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister'schair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers,said in a low, but eager, voice,""Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them.  Don't let them make YOU unhappy.""She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding herface on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears.  Every body'sattention was called, and almost every body was concerned.--ColonelBrandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs.Jennings, with a very intelligent ""Ah! poor dear,"" immediately gave herher salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the authorof this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to oneclose by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account ofthe whole shocking affair.In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an endto the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retainedthe impression of what had passed, the whole evening.""Poor Marianne!"" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,as soon as he could secure his attention,-- ""She has not such goodhealth as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor'sconstitution;--and one must allow that there is something very tryingto a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personalattractions.  You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WASremarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--Now you see it is all gone."""
Sense & Sensibility,35,"CHAPTER 35Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had foundin her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection betweenthe families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride, hermeanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehendall the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, andretarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwisefree;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake,that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any otherof Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence upon hercaprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion.  Or at least, if shedid not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered toLucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she OUGHT tohave rejoiced.She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by thecivility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should sovery much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid herbecause she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allowher to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, becauseher real situation was unknown.  But that it was so, had not only beendeclared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over again thenext morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middletonset her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,to tell her how happy she was.The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soonafter she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.""My dear friend,"" cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, ""Icome to talk to you of my happiness.  Could anything be so flatteringas Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affableas she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--butthe very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in herbehaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy tome.  Now was not it so?-- You saw it all; and was not you quite struckwith it?""""She was certainly very civil to you.""""Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast dealmore.  Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride,no hauteur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness andaffability!""Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her toown that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to goon.--""Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,"" said she, ""nothingcould be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that wasnot the case""--""I guessed you would say so,""--replied Lucy quickly--""but there was noreason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she didnot, and her liking me is every thing.  You shan't talk me out of mysatisfaction.  I am sure it will all end well, and there will be nodifficulties at all, to what I used to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is acharming woman, and so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.Dashwood was!""To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.""Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don't speak;--sure youan't well.""""I never was in better health.""""I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it.  Ishould be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have been the greatestcomfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have donewithout your friendship.""--Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied,""Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next toEdward's love, it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--Butnow there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet prettyoften, for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shallbe a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half histime with his sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars willvisit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to saymore than once, they should always be glad to see me.-- They are suchcharming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think ofher, you cannot speak too high.""But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULDtell her sister.  Lucy continued.""I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had tooka dislike to me.  If she had only made me a formal courtesy, forinstance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice ofme, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I mean--ifI had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gaveit all up in despair.  I could not have stood it.  For where she DOESdislike, I know it is most violent.""Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, bythe door's being thrown open, the servant's announcing Mr. Ferrars, andEdward's immediately walking in.It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each shewed thatit was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed tohave as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as toadvance farther into it.  The very circumstance, in its unpleasantestform, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallenon them.--They were not only all three together, but were togetherwithout the relief of any other person.  The ladies recoveredthemselves first.  It was not Lucy's business to put herself forward,and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up.  She couldtherefore only LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,said no more.But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and herown, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment'srecollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almosteasy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort stillimproved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor theconsciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her fromsaying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very muchregretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, asa friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes ofLucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enoughto sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies ina proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex mightmake it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, norcould his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make nocontribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who wasobliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health,their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,but never did.Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herselfso heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetchingMarianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, andTHAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes onthe landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she wentto her sister.  When that was once done, however, it was time for theraptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into thedrawing-room immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him was like everyother of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken.  She methim with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed theaffection of a sister.""Dear Edward!"" she cried, ""this is a moment of great happiness!--Thiswould almost make amends for every thing!""Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before suchwitnesses he dared not say half what he really felt.  Again they allsat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne waslooking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward andsometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each othershould be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence.  Edward was the firstto speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and expresshis fear of her not finding London agree with her.""Oh, don't think of me!"" she replied with spirited earnestness, thoughher eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, ""don't think of MYhealth.  Elinor is well, you see.  That must be enough for us both.""This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, norto conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with novery benignant expression.""Do you like London?"" said Edward, willing to say any thing that mightintroduce another subject.""Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; andthank Heaven! you are what you always were!""She paused--no one spoke.""I think, Elinor,"" she presently added, ""we must employ Edward to takecare of us in our return to Barton.  In a week or two, I suppose, weshall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling toaccept the charge.""Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not evenhimself.  But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily traceit to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, andsoon talked of something else.""We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday!  So dull, sowretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, whichcannot be said now.""And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of herfinding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of herbeing particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more inprivate.""But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?""""I was engaged elsewhere.""""Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends were to be met?""""Perhaps, Miss Marianne,"" cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge onher, ""you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have nomind to keep them, little as well as great.""Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of thesting; for she calmly replied,""Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure thatconscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.  And I really believehe HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulousin performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may makeagainst his interest or pleasure.  He is the most fearful of givingpain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,of any body I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.  What!are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend ofmine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit tomy open commendation.""The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happenedto be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of herauditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soongot up to go away.""Going so soon!"" said Marianne; ""my dear Edward, this must not be.""And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucycould not stay much longer.  But even this encouragement failed, for hewould go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lastedtwo hours, soon afterwards went away.""What can bring her here so often?"" said Marianne, on her leaving them.""Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward!""""Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest knownto him of any.  It is but natural that he should like to see her aswell as ourselves.""Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, ""You know, Elinor, that thisis a kind of talking which I cannot bear.  If you only hope to haveyour assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, youought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it.  Icannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not reallywanted.""She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could giveno information that would convince Marianne; and painful as theconsequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she wasobliged to submit to it.  All that she could hope, was that Edwardwould not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearingMarianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part ofthe pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she had everyreason to expect."
Sense & Sensibility,36,"CHAPTER 36Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to theworld, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of ason and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at leastto all those intimate connections who knew it before.This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced atemporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in alike degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished tobe as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning assoon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening;and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons,spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfortthey would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs.Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishesof everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton andthe two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as littlevalued, as it was professedly sought.They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; andby the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding onTHEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour toElinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.  Because theyneither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe themgood-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied themsatirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use, and easilygiven.Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.  It checked theidleness of one, and the business of the other.  Lady Middleton wasashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy wasproud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they woulddespise her for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed of thethree, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her toit entirely.  Would either of them only have given her a full andminute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby,she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of thebest place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw outexpressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropta reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect wasproduced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust inthe latter.  An effort even yet lighter might have made her theirfriend.  Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor!  But solittle were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, thatif Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day withouthearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kindenough to bestow on herself.All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totallyunsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thingfor the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her youngfriends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid oldwoman so long.  She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes ather own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellentspirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's welldoing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detailof her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint.Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex,of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, atdifferent times, the most striking resemblance between this baby andevery one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing hisfather of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly likeevery other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought toacknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in theworld.I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this timebefell Mrs. John Dashwood.  It so happened that while her two sisterswith Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, anotherof her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself notapparently likely to produce evil to her.  But while the imaginationsof other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of ourconduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happinessmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.  In the presentinstance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outruntruth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the MissDashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, sheimmediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and thismisconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards ofinvitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a smallmusical party at her house.  The consequence of which was, that Mrs.John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly greatinconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, whatwas still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearingto treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might notexpect to go out with her a second time?  The power of disappointingthem, it was true, must always be hers.  But that was not enough; forwhen people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to bewrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better fromthem.Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit ofgoing out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference toher, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanicallyfor every evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallestamusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the lastmoment, where it was to take her.To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, asnot to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of hertoilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes oftheir being together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minuteobservation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked everything; was never easy till she knew the price of every part ofMarianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogetherwith better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopesof finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.  Theimpertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generallyconcluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, wasconsidered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for afterundergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, thecolour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almostsure of being told that upon ""her word she looked vastly smart, and shedared to say she would make a great many conquests.""With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the presentoccasion, to her brother's carriage; which they were ready to enterfive minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not veryagreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house ofher acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their partthat might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.The events of this evening were not very remarkable.  The party, likeother musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had realtaste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers inEngland.As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made noscruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever itsuited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, andvioloncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in theroom.  In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group ofyoung men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-casesat Gray's.  She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself, andspeaking familiarly to her brother; and had just determined to find outhis name from the latter, when they both came towards her, and Mr.Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bowwhich assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he wasexactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happyhad it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on hisown merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations!  For then hisbrother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what theill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun.  But while shewondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find thatthe emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity withthe modesty and worth of the other.  Why they WERE different, Robertexclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour'sconversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extremeGAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in propersociety, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to anynatural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;while he himself, though probably without any particular, any materialsuperiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.""Upon my soul,"" he added, ""I believe it is nothing more; and so I oftentell my mother, when she is grieving about it.  'My dear Madam,' Ialways say to her, 'you must make yourself easy.  The evil is nowirremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would yoube persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, toplace Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of hislife?  If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have beenprevented.' This is the way in which I always consider the matter, andmy mother is perfectly convinced of her error.""Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be hergeneral estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could notthink of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.""You reside in Devonshire, I think,""--was his next observation, ""in acottage near Dawlish.""Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rathersurprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without livingnear Dawlish.  He bestowed his hearty approbation however on theirspecies of house.""For my own part,"" said he, ""I am excessively fond of a cottage; thereis always so much comfort, so much elegance about them.  And I protest,if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build onemyself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myselfdown at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy.  Iadvise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage.  My friendLord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's.  I was to decideon the best of them.  'My dear Courtland,' said I, immediately throwingthem all into the fire, 'do not adopt either of them, but by all meansbuild a cottage.' And that I fancy, will be the end of it.""Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in acottage; but this is all a mistake.  I was last month at my friendElliott's, near Dartford.  Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  'Buthow can it be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it isto be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage that will hold tencouple, and where can the supper be?' I immediately saw that therecould be no difficulty in it, so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do notbe uneasy.  The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be openfor tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in thesaloon.'  Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought.  We measured thedining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and theaffair was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact, yousee, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be aswell enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.""Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved thecompliment of rational opposition.As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thoughtstruck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, forher approbation, when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs.Dennison's mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, hadsuggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,while Mrs. Jennings's engagements kept her from home.  The expense wouldbe nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether anattention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to berequisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to hisfather.  Fanny was startled at the proposal.""I do not see how it can be done,"" said she, ""without affronting LadyMiddleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should beexceedingly glad to do it.  You know I am always ready to pay them anyattention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.  Butthey are Lady Middleton's visitors.  How can I ask them away from her?""Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of herobjection.  ""They had already spent a week in this manner in ConduitStreet, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving thesame number of days to such near relations.""Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,""My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend afew days with us.  They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; andI think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very wellby Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but theMiss Steeles may not be in town any more.  I am sure you will likethem; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and sodoes my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!""Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity of inviting the MissSteeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolutionof inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slylysuspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, bybringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne asTHEIR visitor.Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that hadprocured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company andher sister's, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as LadyMiddleton could spare them.  This was enough to make Lucy really andreasonably happy.  Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!  Suchan opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above allthings, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation themost gratifying to her feelings!  It was an advantage that could not betoo gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and thevisit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days'time.When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes afterits arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in theexpectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafedon so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-willtowards her arose from something more than merely malice againstherself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thingthat Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already subdued the pride of LadyMiddleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. JohnDashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability ofgreater.The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinorof their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accountsof the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.  Mrs.Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in herlife, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book madeby some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not knowwhether she should ever be able to part with them.[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume II ended.]"
Sense & Sensibility,37,"CHAPTER 37Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother feltit no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her; and,contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned fromthat period to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found theMiss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled inBerkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit toMrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting byherself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her tohear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea,began directly to justify it, by saying,""Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?""""No, ma'am.  What is it?""""Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr.Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child.  She wassure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,' says I, 'it isnothing in the world, but the red gum--' and nurse said just the same.But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for;and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so hestepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he saidjust as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, andthen Charlotte was easy.  And so, just as he was going away again, itcame into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think ofit, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.  So uponthat, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to knowsomething or other, and at last he said in a whisper, 'For fear anyunpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as totheir sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that Ibelieve there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood willdo very well.'""""What! is Fanny ill?""""That is exactly what I said, my dear.  'Lord!' says I, 'is Mrs.Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the long and the short ofthe matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars,the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as itturns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to mycousin Lucy!--There's for you, my dear!--And not a creature knowing asyllable of the matter, except Nancy!--Could you have believed such athing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another;but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobodysuspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together,or I am sure I should have found it out directly.  Well, and so thiswas kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she noryour brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--till this verymorning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but noconjurer, popt it all out.  'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they areall so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at hercarpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had just beensaying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought tomake a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forgetwho.  So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride.She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams asreached your brother's ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-roomdown stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in thecountry.  So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, forLucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say, I think she was used veryhardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her intoa fainting fit.  Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly;and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not knowwhat to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minutelonger in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HISknees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed uptheir clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was sofrightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan foundthe house in all this uproar.  The carriage was at the door ready totake my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he cameoff; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; andNancy, she was almost as bad.  I declare, I have no patience with yoursister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite ofher.  Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears ofit!  To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrousfond of her, as well he may.  I should not wonder, if he was to be inthe greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and Ihad a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he isgone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs.Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousinsleft the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too;and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for either of them.  Ihave no notion of people's making such a to-do about money andgreatness.  There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy shouldnot marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by herson, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better thanany body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs.Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make asgood an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.  Lord!how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours--or a littlebigger--with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them toa housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fitthem exactly.""Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collecther thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make suchobservations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interestin it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be thecase) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happyabove all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well ableto speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment,as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every oneconcerned in it.She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event reallywas; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its beingpossible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward andLucy.  What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be adoubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious toknow how Edward would conduct himself.  For HIM she felt muchcompassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains toprocure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw thenecessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion.  No time was to belost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or anyresentment against Edward.Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was going to remove what shereally believed to be her sister's chief consolation,--to give suchparticulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her goodopinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointmentover again.  But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary tobe done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or torepresent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as theself-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward'sengagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be givenwithout emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, norimpetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Mariannelistened with horror, and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be thecomforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; andall the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composureof mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge butof imprudence, was readily offered.But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.  Edward seemeda second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HADloved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself!  As forLucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutelyincapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuadedat first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection ofEdward for her.  She would not even admit it to have been natural; andElinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which onlycould convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the factof the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne'sfeelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity ofdetail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe herdistress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The firstquestion on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,--""How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?""""I have known it these four months.  When Lucy first came to BartonPark last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement.""At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which herlips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed--""Four months!--Have you known of this four months?""Elinor confirmed it.""What!--while attending me in all my misery, has this been on yourheart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!""--""It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!""""Four months!""--cried Marianne again.--""So calm!--so cheerful!--howhave you been supported?""--""By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged meto be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint ofthe truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create inthem a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power tosatisfy.""Marianne seemed much struck.""I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother,"" addedElinor; ""and once or twice I have attempted it;--but without betrayingmy trust, I never could have convinced you.""""Four months!--and yet you loved him!""--""Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others wasdear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion.  I would not haveyou suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffermaterially myself.  I have many things to support me.  I am notconscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of myown, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther.I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.  I wish him very happy; and Iam so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harboursome regret, in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--Andafter all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of asingle and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one'shappiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is notmeant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edwardwill marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person andunderstanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him toforget that he ever thought another superior to HER.""--""If such is your way of thinking,"" said Marianne, ""if the loss of whatis most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, yourresolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to bewondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.""""I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--Forfour months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, withoutbeing at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that itwould make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained toyou, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was toldme,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whoseprior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,with triumph.-- This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had tooppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been mostdeeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had herhopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have knownmyself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing onecircumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothinghas proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent tome.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, andthe insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of anattachment, without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has beengoing on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my onlyunhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely youmay suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure of mind with whichI have brought myself at present to consider the matter, theconsolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect ofconstant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up ofthemselves;--they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No,Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothingcould have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearestfriends--from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy.""--Marianne was quite subdued.--""Oh! Elinor,"" she cried, ""you have made me hate myself for ever.--Howbarbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, whohave borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be onlysuffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I canmake you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been tryingto do it away.""The tenderest caresses followed this confession.  In such a frame ofmind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from herwhatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engagednever to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance ofbitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase ofdislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bringthem together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- Thesewere great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured,no reparation could be too much for her to make.She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.--Sheattended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with anunchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heardthree times to say, ""Yes, ma'am.""--She listened to her praise of Lucywith only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jenningstalked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in herthroat.--Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feelequal to any thing herself.The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from theirbrother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadfulaffair, and bring them news of his wife.""You have heard, I suppose,"" said he with great solemnity, as soon ashe was seated, ""of the very shocking discovery that took place underour roof yesterday.""They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.""Your sister,"" he continued, ""has suffered dreadfully.  Mrs. Ferrarstoo--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but Iwill hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of usquite overcome.  Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.  But Iwould not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there is nothing materiallyto be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolutionequal to any thing.  She has borne it all, with the fortitude of anangel!  She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and onecannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting with suchingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidencehad been placed!  It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart,that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because shethought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behavedgirls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wishedvery much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while yourkind friend there, was attending her daughter.  And now to be sorewarded!  'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in heraffectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead of them.'""Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.""What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, isnot to be described.  While she with the truest affection had beenplanning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed thathe could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such asuspicion could never have entered her head!  If she suspected ANYprepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter.  'THERE, tobe sure,' said she, 'I might have thought myself safe.' She was quitein an agony.  We consulted together, however, as to what should bedone, and at last she determined to send for Edward.  He came.  But Iam sorry to relate what ensued.  All that Mrs. Ferrars could say tomake him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may wellsuppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of no avail.Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.  I never thought Edwardso stubborn, so unfeeling before.  His mother explained to him herliberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him shewould settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax,brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grewdesperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if hestill persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certainpenury that must attend the match.  His own two thousand pounds sheprotested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so farwould she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if hewere to enter into any profession with a view of better support, shewould do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.""Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her handstogether, and cried, ""Gracious God!  can this be possible!""""Well may you wonder, Marianne,"" replied her brother, ""at the obstinacywhich could resist such arguments as these.  Your exclamation is verynatural.""Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, andforbore.""All this, however,"" he continued, ""was urged in vain.  Edward saidvery little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement.  He wouldstand to it, cost him what it might.""""Then,"" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to besilent, ""he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him arascal.  I have some little concern in the business, as well asyourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not abetter kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a goodhusband.""John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not opento provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especiallyanybody of good fortune.  He therefore replied, without any resentment,""I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under heruncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortuneas Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. Inshort, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whomyou have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish her extremely happy;and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole, has been such as everyconscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It hasbeen dignified and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fearit will be a bad one.""Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrungfor the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother's threats, for awoman who could not reward him.""Well, sir,"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""and how did it end?""""I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward isdismissed for ever from his mother's notice.  He left her houseyesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I donot know; for WE of course can make no inquiry.""""Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?""""What, indeed, ma'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.  Born to theprospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive a situation moredeplorable.  The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live onit?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but forhis own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of twothousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousandpounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition.  We mustall feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of ourpower to assist him.""""Poor young man!"" cried Mrs. Jennings, ""I am sure he should be verywelcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if Icould see him.  It is not fit that he should be living about at his owncharge now, at lodgings and taverns.""Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though shecould not forbear smiling at the form of it.""If he would only have done as well by himself,"" said John Dashwood,""as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have beenin his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing.  But as itis, it must be out of anybody's power to assist him.  And there is onething more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--hismother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settleTHAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward's, onproper conditions.  I left her this morning with her lawyer, talkingover the business.""""Well!"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""that is HER revenge.  Everybody has a wayof their own.  But I don't think mine would be, to make one sonindependent, because another had plagued me.""Marianne got up and walked about the room.""Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,"" continued John,""than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which mighthave been his own?  Poor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely.""A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded hisvisit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he reallybelieved there was no material danger in Fanny's indisposition, andthat they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the presentoccasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, theDashwoods', and Edward's.Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; andas her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary inMrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon theparty."
Sense & Sensibility,38,"CHAPTER 38Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but onlyElinor and Marianne understood its true merit.  THEY only knew howlittle he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was theconsolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remainto him in the loss of friends and fortune.  Elinor gloried in hisintegrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for hispunishment.  But though confidence between them was, by this publicdiscovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on whicheither of them were fond of dwelling when alone.  Elinor avoided itupon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by thetoo warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward'scontinued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; andMarianne's courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topicwhich always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by thecomparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister hadhoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain ofcontinual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had neverexerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened that shestill fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it onlydispirited her more.Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairsin Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.  But though so much of thematter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have hadenough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking aftermore, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort andinquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but thehindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to themwithin that time.The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was sofine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,though it was only the second week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinorwere of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys wereagain in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose ratherto stay at home, than venture into so public a place.An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after theyentered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuingwith them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she washerself left to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could byany chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her.  But at lastshe found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meetingthem, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness ofMrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's.Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,""Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you any thing if youask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke.""It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and Elinor's too,that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked; for nothing wouldotherwise have been learnt.""I am so glad to meet you;"" said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly bythe arm--""for I wanted to see you of all things in the world.""  Andthen lowering her voice, ""I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all aboutit.  Is she angry?""""Not at all, I believe, with you.""""That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?""""I cannot suppose it possible that she should be.""""I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have had such a time ofit!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life.  She vowed at firstshe would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for meagain, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we areas good friends as ever.  Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and putin the feather last night.  There now, YOU are going to laugh at metoo.  But why should not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it ISthe Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part, I should neverhave known he DID like it better than any other colour, if he had nothappened to say so.  My cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declaresometimes I do not know which way to look before them.""She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again tothe first.""Well, but Miss Dashwood,"" speaking triumphantly, ""people may say whatthey chuse about Mr. Ferrars's declaring he would not have Lucy, for itis no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for suchill-natured reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might thinkabout it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to setit down for certain.""""I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,""said Elinor.""Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more thanone; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses couldexpect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirtythousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing atall; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.  And besides that, my cousinRichard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr.Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for threedays, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heartLucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother'sWednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, andSaturday, and did not know what was become of him.  Once Lucy thoughtto write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.  However thismorning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all cameout, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and beentalked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared beforethem all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would hehave.  And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon ashe had went away from his mother's house, he had got upon his horse,and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he had stayedabout at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the betterof it.  And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, itseemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, itwould be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it mustbe for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and nohope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had somethoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to liveupon that?--He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and sohe begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to thematter directly, and leave him shift for himself.  I heard him say allthis as plain as could possibly be.  And it was entirely for HER sake,and upon HER account, that he said a word about being off, and not uponhis own.  I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tiredof her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it.  But,to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so shetold him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things youknow)--she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the worldto be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little soever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know,or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy, and talkedon some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should takeorders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living.And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called frombelow to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would takeone of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the roomand interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she didnot care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair ofsilk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.""""I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,"" said Elinor;""you were all in the same room together, were not you?""""No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make lovewhen any body else is by?  Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must knowbetter than that.  (Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up inthe drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at thedoor.""""How!"" cried Elinor; ""have you been repeating to me what you onlylearnt yourself by listening at the door?  I am sorry I did not know itbefore; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give meparticulars of a conversation which you ought not to have knownyourself.  How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?""""Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at the door, and heardwhat I could.  And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me;for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secretstogether, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind achimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said.""Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not bekept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.""Edward talks of going to Oxford soon,"" said she; ""but now he islodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  What an ill-natured woman his mother is,an't she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, Ishan't say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure they did sendus home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.  Andfor my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask usfor the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however,nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight.Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go therefor a time; and after THAT, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, hewill be ordained.  I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!(giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what my cousins willsay, when they hear of it.  They will tell me I should write to theDoctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living.  I know they will;but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- 'La!' Ishall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think of such a thing?  Iwrite to the Doctor, indeed!'""""Well,"" said Elinor, ""it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst.You have got your answer ready.""Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach ofher own party made another more necessary.""Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  I had a vast deal more to say toyou, but I must not stay away from them not any longer.  I assure youthey are very genteel people.  He makes a monstrous deal of money, andthey keep their own coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jenningsabout it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is notin anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anythingshould happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jenningsshould want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and staywith her for as long a time as she likes.  I suppose Lady Middletonwon't ask us any more this bout.  Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne wasnot here.  Remember me kindly to her.  La! if you have not got yourspotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn.""Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to payher farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company wasclaimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession ofknowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, thoughshe had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen andforeplanned in her own mind.  Edward's marriage with Lucy was as firmlydetermined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutelyuncertain, as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended,exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, ofwhich, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager forinformation; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possibleintelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, sheconfined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, asshe felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, wouldchoose to have known.  The continuance of their engagement, and themeans that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all hercommunication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the followingnatural remark.""Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how THAT willend:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interestof his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year! and Lordhelp 'em! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give themtowards furnishing their house.  Two maids and two men, indeed!--as Italked of t'other day.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of allworks.-- Betty's sister would never do for them NOW.""The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post fromLucy herself.  It was as follows:                    ""Bartlett's Building, March.     ""I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the     liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such     a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after     all the troubles we have went through lately,     therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered     dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy     as we must always be in one another's love.  We have     had great trials, and great persecutions, but     however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge     many friends, yourself not the least among them,     whose great kindness I shall always thankfully     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of     it.  I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise     dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with     him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our     parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my     duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake,     and would have parted for ever on the spot, would     he consent to it; but he said it should never be,     he did not regard his mother's anger, while he could     have my affections; our prospects are not very     bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for     the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any     body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you     will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too,     trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John,     or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to     assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what     she did, but she did it for the best, so I say     nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't think it too much     trouble to give us a call, should she come this way     any morning, 'twould be a great kindness, and my     cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds     me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully     and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John,     and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you     chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,                                      ""I am, &c.""As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded tobe its writer's real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction andpraise.""Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quiteproper to let him be off if he would.  That was just like Lucy.--Poorsoul! I wish I COULD get him a living, with all my heart.--She calls medear Mrs. Jennings, you see.  She is a good-hearted girl as everlived.--Very well upon my word.  That sentence is very prettily turned.Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough.  How attentive she is, tothink of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  It is aspretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart greatcredit."""
Sense & Sensibility,39,"CHAPTER 39The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day.  She sighedfor the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that ifany place could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardlyless anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less benton its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of thedifficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be broughtto acknowledge.  She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughtstowards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes totheir kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of hergood-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them fromhome yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much moreeligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland aboutthe end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with bothher friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go withthem.  This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacyof Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness byMr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of hismanners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,induced her to accept it with pleasure.When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply wasnot very auspicious.""Cleveland!""--she cried, with great agitation.  ""No, I cannot go toCleveland.""--""You forget,"" said Elinor gently, ""that its situation is not...that itis not in the neighbourhood of...""""But it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go into Somersetshire.--There,where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me togo there.""Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming suchfeelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working onothers;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix thetime of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished tosee, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plancould do, and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland, whichwas within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was notbeyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servantmight easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be nooccasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now beat home in little more than three weeks' time.  As Marianne's affectionfor her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,over the imaginary evils she had started.Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, that shepressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter herdesign; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, everything relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--andMarianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours thatwere yet to divide her from Barton.""Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the MissDashwoods;""--was Mrs. Jennings's address to him when he first called onher, after their leaving her was settled--""for they are quite resolvedupon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be, when Icome back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as twocats.""Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of theirfuture ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might givehimself an escape from it;--and if so, she had soon afterwards goodreason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to thewindow to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which shewas going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look ofparticular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape herobservation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had evenchanged her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close bythe piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keepherself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended withagitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue heremployment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in theinterval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some wordsof the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to beapologising for the badness of his house.  This set the matter beyond adoubt.  She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.  What Elinor said in replyshe could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, thatshe did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jenningscommended her in her heart for being so honest.  They then talked onfor a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when anotherlucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her these words in theColonel's calm voice,--""I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.""Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almostready to cry out, ""Lord! what should hinder it?""--but checking herdesire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.""This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older.""This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend ormortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up theconference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jenningsvery plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her tofeel what she said,""I shall always think myself very much obliged to you.""Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered thatafter hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leaveof them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go awaywithout making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend couldhave made so indifferent a suitor.What had really passed between them was to this effect.""I have heard,"" said he, with great compassion, ""of the injustice yourfriend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understandthe matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for perseveringin his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I beenrightly informed?--Is it so?--""Elinor told him that it was.""The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,""--he replied, with greatfeeling,--""of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people longattached to each other, is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know whatshe may be doing--what she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr.Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased withhim.  He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquaintedin a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for hisown sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.  I understandthat he intends to take orders.  Will you be so good as to tell himthat the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by thisday's post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT,perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may benonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more  valuable.-- Itis a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did notmake more than 200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable ofimprovement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a verycomfortable income.  Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presentingit to him, will be very great.  Pray assure him of it.""Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have beengreater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.The preferment, which only two days before she had considered ashopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--andSHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!--Heremotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very differentcause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, mighthave a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which togetherprompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmlyexpressed.  She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke ofEdward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knewthem to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission withpleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an officeto another.  But at the same time, she could not help thinking that noone could so well perform it as himself.  It was an office in short,from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving anobligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be sparedherself;-- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, decliningit likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through hermeans, that she would not on any account make farther opposition.Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heardhis address from Miss Steele.  She could undertake therefore to informhim of it, in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing sorespectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that hementioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;--anevil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made verylight of, at least as far as regarded its size.""The smallness of the house,"" said she, ""I cannot imagine anyinconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family andincome.""By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr.Ferrars's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation; forhe did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply suchan income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settleon--and he said so.""This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortableas a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.  I am sorry to say thatmy patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive.If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to servehim farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do,if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish Icould be at present.  What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal,his only object of happiness.  His marriage must still be a distantgood;--at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--""Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended thedelicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of whatreally passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood atthe window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, mayperhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor lessproperly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage."
Sense & Sensibility,40,"CHAPTER 40""Well, Miss Dashwood,"" said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soonas the gentleman had withdrawn, ""I do not ask you what the Colonel hasbeen saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out ofhearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his business.And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish youjoy of it with all my heart.""""Thank you, ma'am,"" said Elinor.  ""It is a matter of great joy to me;and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly.  There arenot many men who would act as he has done.  Few people who have socompassionate a heart!  I never was more astonished in my life.""""Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an't the least astonished at itin the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing morelikely to happen.""""You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's general benevolence;but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so verysoon occur.""""Opportunity!"" repeated Mrs. Jennings--""Oh! as to that, when a man hasonce made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soonfind an opportunity.  Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again andagain; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think Ishall soon know where to look for them.""""You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose,"" said Elinor, with afaint smile.""Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house being a bad one,I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one asever I saw.""""He spoke of its being out of repair.""""Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he repair it?--who should doit but himself?""They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce thecarriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing togo, said,--""Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall bequite alone.  I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mindis too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you mustlong to tell your sister all about it.""Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.""Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mentionit at present to any body else.""""Oh! very well,"" said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.  ""Then youwould not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far asHolborn to-day.""""No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please.  One day's delay will not bevery material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it oughtnot to be mentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.  It isof importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will ofcourse have much to do relative to his ordination.""This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.  Why Mr.Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she couldnot immediately comprehend.  A few moments' reflection, however,produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed;--""Oh, ho!--I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be the man.  Well, somuch the better for him.  Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained inreadiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward betweenyou.  But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?  Should notthe Colonel write himself?--sure, he is the proper person.""Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings'sspeech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and thereforeonly replied to its conclusion.""Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one toannounce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself.""""And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy!However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to write.)  Youknow your own concerns best.  So goodby, my dear.  I have not heard ofany thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed.""And away she went; but returning again in a moment,""I have just been thinking of Betty's sister, my dear.  I should bevery glad to get her so good a mistress.  But whether she would do fora lady's maid, I am sure I can't tell.  She is an excellent housemaid,and works very well at her needle.  However, you will think of all thatat your leisure.""""Certainly, ma'am,"" replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.How she should begin--how she should express herself in her note toEdward, was now all her concern.  The particular circumstances betweenthem made a difficulty of that which to any other person would havebeen the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say toomuch or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the penin her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as hecame to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for notreturning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that MissDashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particularbusiness.Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of herperplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herselfproperly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving theinformation by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force herupon this greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusionwere very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had not seen himbefore since his engagement became public, and therefore not since hisknowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness ofwhat she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made herfeel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.  He too was muchdistressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state ofembarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion onfirst coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining tobe on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he couldsay any thing, after taking a chair.""Mrs. Jennings told me,"" said he, ""that you wished to speak with me, atleast I understood her so--or I certainly should not have intruded onyou in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have beenextremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;especially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable thatI should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again.  I go to Oxfordtomorrow.""""You would not have gone, however,"" said Elinor, recovering herself,and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon aspossible, ""without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not beenable to give them in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what shesaid.  I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was onthe point of communicating by paper.  I am charged with a mostagreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.)Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me tosay, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasurein offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishesit were more valuable.  Allow me to congratulate you on having sorespectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that theliving--it is about two hundred a-year--were much more considerable,and such as might better enable you to--as might be more than atemporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might establishall your views of happiness.""What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expectedthat any one else should say for him.  He LOOKED all the astonishmentwhich such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail ofexciting; but he said only these two words,""Colonel Brandon!""""Yes,"" continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of theworst was over, ""Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concernfor what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which theunjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern which Iam sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; andlikewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, andhis particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion.""""Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible?""""The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to findfriendship any where.""""No,"" replied he, with sudden consciousness, ""not to find it in YOU;for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe itall.--I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know,I am no orator.""""You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you that you owe it entirely,at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon'sdiscernment of it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,till I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had itever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift.As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know heHAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owenothing to my solicitation.""Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, butshe was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress ofEdward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probablycontributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recentlyentered it.  For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor hadceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,""Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.  I havealways heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems himhighly.  He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectlythe gentleman.""""Indeed,"" replied Elinor, ""I believe that you will find him, on fartheracquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will besuch very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almostclose to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that heSHOULD be all this.""Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave hera look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that hemight hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and themansion-house much greater.""Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street,"" said he, soonafterwards, rising from his chair.Elinor told him the number of the house.""I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will notallow me to give YOU; to assure him that he has made me a very--anexceedingly happy man.""Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a veryearnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for hishappiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on HIS,with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power ofexpressing it.""When I see him again,"" said Elinor to herself, as the door shut himout, ""I shall see him the husband of Lucy.""And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider thepast, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings ofEdward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing peoplewhom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have agreat deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the importantsecret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted toit again as soon as Elinor appeared.""Well, my dear,"" she cried, ""I sent you up the young man.  Did not Ido right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not findhim very unwilling to accept your proposal?""""No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely.""""Well, and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend uponthat.""""Really,"" said Elinor, ""I know so little of these kind of forms, that Ican hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparationnecessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete hisordination.""""Two or three months!"" cried Mrs. Jennings; ""Lord! my dear, how calmlyyou talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lordbless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And thoughone would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do thinkit is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.  Suresomebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is inorders already.""""My dear ma'am,"" said Elinor, ""what can you be thinking of?-- Why,Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.""""Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that theColonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.Ferrars!""The deception could not continue after this; and an explanationimmediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement forthe moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs.Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and stillwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first.""Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one,"" said she, after the firstebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, ""and very likely MAYbe out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for ahouse that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor,and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--and toyou too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quiteridiculous.  But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do something to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucygoes to it.""""But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living'sbeing enough to allow them to marry.""""The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-yearhimself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less.  Take my wordfor it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at DelafordParsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an'tthere.""Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their notwaiting for any thing more."
Sense & Sensibility,41,"CHAPTER 41Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded withhis happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time hereached Bartlett's Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.Jennings, who called on her again the next day with hercongratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before inher life.Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; andshe joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of theirbeing all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinorthat credit which Edward WOULD give her, that she spoke of herfriendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready toown all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertionfor their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future, wouldever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing inthe world for those she really valued.  As for Colonel Brandon, she wasnot only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover trulyanxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcelyresolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could,of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in BerkeleyStreet, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of hiswife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feelit necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation, however,which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not theassistance of any encouragement from her companions.  Marianne, notcontented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent toprevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though hercarriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs.John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked afterthe late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by takingEdward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her companyagain.  The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay avisit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to runthe risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others hadso much reason to dislike.Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from thehouse, her husband accidentally came out.  He expressed great pleasurein meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call inBerkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to seeher, invited her to come in.They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.""Fanny is in her own room, I suppose,"" said he:--""I will go to herpresently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in theworld to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially therecannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always greatfavourites.--Why would not Marianne come?""--Elinor made what excuse she could for her.""I am not sorry to see you alone,"" he replied, ""for I have a good dealto say to you.  This living of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--hashe really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and wascoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it.""""It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living ofDelaford to Edward.""""Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--noconnection between them!--and now that livings fetch such aprice!--what was the value of this?""""About two hundred a year.""""Very well--and for the next presentation to a living of thatvalue--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, andlikely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteenhundred pounds.  And how came he not to have settled that matter beforethis person's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but aman of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvidentin a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I am convincedthat there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every humancharacter.  I suppose, however--on recollection--that the case mayprobably be THIS.  Edward is only to hold the living till the person towhom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough totake it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.""Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating thatshe had herself been employed in conveying the offer from ColonelBrandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on whichit was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.""It is truly astonishing!""--he cried, after hearing what shesaid--""what could be the Colonel's motive?""""A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.""""Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very luckyman.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though Ihave broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,--she will not liketo hear it much talked of.""Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that shethought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealthto her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possiblyimpoverished.""Mrs. Ferrars,"" added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming soimportant a subject, ""knows nothing about it at present, and I believeit will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as maybe.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all.""""But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to besupposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction inknowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must bequite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is shesupposed to feel at all?--She has done with her son, she cast him offfor ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, casthim off likewise.  Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imaginedliable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she cannotbe interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weakas to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety ofa parent!""""Ah! Elinor,"" said John, ""your reasoning is very good, but it isfounded on ignorance of human nature.  When Edward's unhappy matchtakes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she hadnever discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that mayaccelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much aspossible.  Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.""""You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memoryby THIS time.""""You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one of the mostaffectionate mothers in the world.""Elinor was silent.""We think NOW,""--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, ""of ROBERT'Smarrying Miss Morton.""Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother'stone, calmly replied,""The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair.""""Choice!--how do you mean?""""I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must bethe same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert.""""Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to allintents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to anything else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know thatone is superior to the other.""Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.--Hisreflections ended thus.""Of ONE thing, my dear sister,"" kindly taking her hand, and speaking inan awful whisper,--""I may assure you;--and I WILL do it, because I knowit must gratify you.  I have good reason to think--indeed I have itfrom the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise itwould be very wrong to say any thing about it--but I have it from thevery best authority--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars sayit herself--but her daughter DID, and I have it from her--That inshort, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a certainconnection--you understand me--it would have been far preferable toher, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does.  Iwas exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in thatlight--a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.  'It wouldhave been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the least evil of the two, andshe would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse.' But however, allthat is quite out of the question--not to be thought of ormentioned--as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all thatis gone by.  But I thought I would just tell you of this, because Iknew how much it must please you.  Not that you have any reason toregret, my dear Elinor.  There is no doubt of your doing exceedinglywell--quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered.  HasColonel Brandon been with you lately?""Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise herself-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she wastherefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in replyherself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from herbrother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.  After a few moments'chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of hersister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor wasleft to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gayunconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying sounfair a division of his mother's love and liberality, to the prejudiceof his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course oflife, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her mostunfavourable opinion of his head and heart.They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began tospeak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was veryinquisitive on the subject.  Elinor repeated the particulars of it, asshe had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though verydifferent, was not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughedmost immoderately.  The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and livingin a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when tothat was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in awhite surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smithand Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, theconclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixedon him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited.  It was alook, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,and gave no intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.""We may treat it as a joke,"" said he, at last, recovering from theaffected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaietyof the moment--""but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business.  PoorEdward!  he is ruined for ever.  I am extremely sorry for it--for Iknow him to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellowperhaps, as any in the world.  You must not judge of him, MissDashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners arecertainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born, youknow, with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to seehim in a circle of strangers!--to be sure it was pitiable enough!--butupon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom;and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, aswhen it all burst forth.  I could not believe it.-- My mother was thefirst person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to actwith resolution, immediately said to her, 'My dear madam, I do not knowwhat you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I mustsay, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see himagain.' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonlyshocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himselfcompletely--shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but, asI directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it;from his style of education, it was always to be expected.  My poormother was half frantic.""""Have you ever seen the lady?""""Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop infor ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her.  The merest awkwardcountry girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.--I remember her perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I should supposelikely to captivate poor Edward.  I offered immediately, as soon as mymother related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuadehim from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found, to do any thing,for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of ittill after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, youknow, to interfere.  But had I been informed of it a few hoursearlier--I think it is most probable--that something might have beenhit on.  I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a verystrong light.  'My dear fellow,' I should have said, 'consider what youare doing.  You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such aone as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot helpthinking, in short, that means might have been found.  But now it isall too late.  He must be starved, you know;--that is certain;absolutely starved.""He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entranceof Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject.  But though SHE neverspoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence onher mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which sheentered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.  Sheeven proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and hersister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more ofthem;--an exertion in which her husband, who attended her into theroom, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish everything that was most affectionate and graceful."
Sense & Sensibility,42,"CHAPTER 42One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received herbrother's congratulations on their travelling so far towards Bartonwithout any expense, and on Colonel Brandon's being to follow them toCleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother andsisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norlandwhenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things wasthe most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public,assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he shouldcome to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in thecountry.It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to sendher to Delaford;--a place, in which, of all others, she would now leastchuse to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it considered asher future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy, whenthey parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two partiesfrom Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respectivehomes, to meet, by appointment, on the road.  For the convenience ofCharlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on theirjourney, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with ColonelBrandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager asshe had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bidadieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed thosehopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguishedfor ever, without great pain.  Nor could she leave the place in whichWilloughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in whichSHE could have no share, without shedding many tears.Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she leftno creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment's regret to bedivided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from thepersecution of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful for bringing hersister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she lookedforward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton mightdo towards restoring Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own.Their journey was safely performed.  The second day brought them intothe cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such wasit dwelt on by turns in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon ofthe third they drove up to Cleveland.Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a slopinglawn.  It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerablyextensive; and like every other place of the same degree of importance,it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smoothgravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn wasdotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship ofthe fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of themaltogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out theoffices.Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from theconsciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirtyfrom Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within itswalls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her childto the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through thewinding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain adistant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wanderingover a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest onthe farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from theirsummits Combe Magna might be seen.In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tearsof agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuitto the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, ofwandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, sheresolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remainedwith the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house,on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest ofthe morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchengarden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to thegardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through thegreen-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter ofCharlotte,--and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in thedisappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, orbeing stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising youngbrood, she found fresh sources of merriment.The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employmentabroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stayat Cleveland.  With great surprise therefore, did she find herselfprevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner.  She haddepended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all overthe grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterredher from it; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dryor pleasant weather for walking.Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.  Mrs. Palmerhad her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of thefriends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton's engagements,and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get fartherthan Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned in it,joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of findingher way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided bythe family in general, soon procured herself a book.Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant and friendlygood humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome.  Theopenness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want ofrecollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the formsof politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, wasengaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it wasnot conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affordinga pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome variety totheir conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain hadreduced very low.Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen somuch variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she knewnot what to expect to find him in his own family.  She found him,however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found himvery capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented frombeing so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as muchsuperior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.Jennings and Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits, theywere marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at allunusual in his sex and time of life.  He was nice in his eating,uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slightit; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have beendevoted to business.  She liked him, however, upon the whole, muchbetter than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that shecould like him no more;--not sorry to be driven by the observation ofhis Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest withcomplacency on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simpletaste, and diffident feelings.Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now receivedintelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshirelately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend ofMr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her agreat deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.--Hisbehaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, hisopen pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, hisreadiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment,and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from thefirst, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect itherself.  But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered herhead, except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could not helpbelieving herself the nicest observer of the two;--she watched hiseyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;--and while hislooks of anxious solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head andthroat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,entirely escaped the latter lady's observation;--SHE could discover inthem the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of herbeing there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but allover the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where thetrees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wetshoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for aday or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasingailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were alldeclined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and acough, and a sore throat, a good night's rest was to cure her entirely;and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she wentto bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies."
Sense & Sensibility,43,"CHAPTER 43Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiryreplied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engagingin her accustomary employments.  But a day spent in sitting shiveringover the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, orin lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour ofher amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and moreindisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister'scomposure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, againstMarianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night,trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, andfelt no real alarm.A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed theexpectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to herbed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice, of sendingfor the Palmers' apothecary.He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood toexpect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet, bypronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing theword ""infection"" to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,on her baby's account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from thefirst to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor, nowlooked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte'sfears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal withher infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions asidle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to bewithstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hourafter Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her little boy and hisnurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived afew miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, ather earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she wasalmost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings,however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long asMarianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care,to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; andElinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her betterexperience in nursing, of material use.Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, andfeeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrowwould find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would haveproduced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; foron that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attendedthe whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken theirmother by surprise on the following forenoon.  The little she said wasall in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried toraise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believedherself, that it would be a very short one.The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of thepatient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was noamendment, did not appear worse.  Their party was now farther reduced;for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanityand good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened awayby his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform hispromise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, ColonelBrandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of goinglikewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed mostacceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so muchuneasiness on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, shethought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that hisstay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him toplay at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with hersister, &c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who wasgratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could notlong even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty waswarmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise MissDashwood in any emergence.Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners ofCleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival.  Itgave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as itgave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and hersituation continued, with little variation, the same.  Mr. Harris, whoattended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, andMiss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the otherswas by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined very earlyin the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and ColonelBrandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings'sforebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.  Hetried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment ofthe apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each dayin which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for theadmission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from hismind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations ofboth were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declaredhis patient materially better.  Her pulse was much stronger, and everysymptom more favourable than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmedin every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in herletters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than herfriend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed themat Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be ableto travel.But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.-- Towards theevening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, anduncomfortable than before.  Her sister, however, still sanguine, waswilling to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue ofhaving sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering thecordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into aslumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects.  Hersleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted aconsiderable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, sheresolved to sit with her during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings,knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early tobed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreatingherself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone withMarianne.The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and hersister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change ofposture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaintwhich passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painfula slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise inthe house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,--""Is mama coming?--""""Not yet,"" cried the other, concealing her terror, and assistingMarianne to lie down again, ""but she will be here, I hope, before it islong.  It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton.""""But she must not go round by London,"" cried Marianne, in the samehurried manner.  ""I shall never see her, if she goes by London.""Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, whileattempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower andquicker than ever!  and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, heralarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantlyfor Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting thelatter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of itsperformance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place byher sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew hewas generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.It was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her difficulties wereimmediately before him.  Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence toattempt the removal of:--he listened to them in silent despondence;--buther difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness thatseemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his mind,he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She thanked himwith brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off hisservant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horsesdirectly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or sucha companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a companionwhose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whosefriendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summonsCOULD be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,would lessen it.HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of acollected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmostdespatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she mightlook for his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.  Thehorses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandononly pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spokentoo low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage.  It was then abouttwelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait forthe arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of thenight.  It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.  Hour afterhour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne's side, andin the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared.  Herapprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her formersecurity; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allowMrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of whather mistress had always thought.Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on hermother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to theheart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled withso many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing hadbeen delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering motherarriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE couldnot come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till afterfive o'clock--arrived.  His opinion, however, made some little amendsfor his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected andunpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger tobe material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatmentmust procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, wascommunicated to Elinor.  He promised to call again in the course ofthree or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxiousattendant more composed than he had found them.With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called totheir aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her nodoubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, herconviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer thecomfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.  The rapid decay, theearly death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have strucka less interested person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's compassionshe had other claims.  She had been for three months her companion, wasstill under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured,and long unhappy.  The distress of her sister too, particularly afavourite, was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jenningsconsidered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was toherself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;--but he came to bedisappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce.  Hismedicines had failed;--the fever was unabated; and Marianne only morequiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catchingall, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call infurther advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had still somethingmore to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was asconfident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouragingassurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of MissDashwood.  She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but shewas almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon,scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering fromone image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spiritsoppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, whoscrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to themany weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointmenthad brought on.  Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and itgave fresh misery to her reflections.About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread ofdisappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to herfriend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in hersister's pulse;--she waited, watched, and examined it again andagain;--and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury underexterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured tocommunicate her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend fromindulging a thought of its continuance;--and Elinor, conning over everyinjunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope.  But it wastoo late.  Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxiousflutter, she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her.Others even arose to confirm it.  Her breath, her skin, her lips, allflattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyeson her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and hope nowoppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillitytill the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;--when his assurances,his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing hisexpectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared herentirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with thepartial justification of her forebodings which had been found in theirlate alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, theprobability of an entire recovery.Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a different kind, and ledto any thing rather than to gaiety.  Marianne restored to life, health,friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart withsensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in ferventgratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,no smiles.  All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent andstrong.She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission thewhole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of herenfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost everylook and every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--but when shesaw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom ofrecovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet,steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced everydoubt.The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expectedback.  At ten o'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later hermother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she mustnow be travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcelyless an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress of time whichyet kept them in ignorance!At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joinedMrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.  Of breakfast she had beenkept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eatingmuch;--and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings ofcontent as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.  Mrs. Jenningswould have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest beforeher mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; butElinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that momentabout her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister anunnecessary instant.  Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairsinto the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to herown room to write letters and sleep.The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared round the house, andthe rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,regarded it not.  Marianne slept through every blast; and thetravellers--they had a rich reward in store, for every presentinconvenience.The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten, Elinor would have beenconvinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to thehouse; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of theALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved intothe adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to besatisfied of the truth.  She instantly saw that her ears had notdeceived her.  The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately inview.  By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to bedrawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poormother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as atthat moment.  The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as thecarriage stopt at the door--of her doubt--her dread--perhaps herdespair!--and of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it wasimpossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done was to be speedy;and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maidwith her sister, she hurried down stairs.The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,assured her that they were already in the house.  She rushed to thedrawing-room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby."
Sense & Sensibility,44,"CHAPTER 44Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyedthe first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room,and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended byhis hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command thansupplication,""Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--I entreat you tostay.""""No, sir,"" she replied with firmness, ""I shall NOT stay.  Your businesscannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you thatMr. Palmer was not in the house.""""Had they told me,"" he cried with vehemence, ""that Mr. Palmer and allhis relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from thedoor.  My business is with you, and only you.""""With me!""--in the utmost amazement--""well, sir,--be quick--and if youcan--less violent.""""Sit down, and I will be both.""She hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility of ColonelBrandon's arriving and finding her there, came across her.  But she hadpromised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor wasengaged.  After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding thatprudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would bestpromote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down.  Hetook the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said byeither.""Pray be quick, sir,""--said Elinor, impatiently;--""I have no time tospare.""He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not tohear her.""Your sister,"" said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--""is outof danger.  I heard it from the servant.  God be praised!--But is ittrue? is it really true?""Elinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with yet greatereagerness.""For God's sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?""""We hope she is.""He rose up, and walked across the room.""Had I known as much half an hour ago--But since I AM here,""--speakingwith a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat--""what does itsignify?--For once, Miss Dashwood--it will be the last time,perhaps--let us be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood forgaiety.-- Tell me honestly""--a deeper glow overspreading hischeeks--""do you think me most a knave or a fool?""Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.  She began tothink that he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, andof such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with thisimpression she immediately rose, saying,""Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am notat leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may bewith me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow.""""I understand you,"" he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voiceperfectly calm; ""yes, I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my coldbeef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.""""At Marlborough!""--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understandwhat he would be at.""Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only tenminutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me anuncheon at Marlborough.""The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as hespoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly mightbring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, shesaid, after a moment's recollection,""Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DO--that after whathas passed--your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself uponmy notice, requires a very particular excuse.--What is it, that youmean by it?""--""I mean,""--said he, with serious energy--""if I can, to make you hate meone degree less than you do NOW.  I mean to offer some kind ofexplanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heartto you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always ablockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something likeforgiveness from Ma--from your sister.""""Is this the real reason of your coming?""""Upon my soul it is,""--was his answer, with a warmth which brought allthe former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself madeher think him sincere.""If that is all, you may be satisfied already,--for Marianne DOES--shehas LONG forgiven you.""""Has she?""--he cried, in the same eager tone.-- ""Then she has forgivenme before she ought to have done it.  But she shall forgive me again,and on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?""Elinor bowed her assent.""I do not know,"" said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, andthoughtfulness on his own,--""how YOU may have accounted for mybehaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may haveimputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it isworth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.  When I firstbecame intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other viewin the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obligedto remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not butplease me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of akind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHEwas, that my heart should have been so insensible!  But at first I mustconfess, my vanity only was elevated by it.  Careless of her happiness,thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I hadalways been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by everymeans in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any designof returning her affection.""Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the mostangry contempt, stopped him, by saying,""It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for meto listen any longer.  Such a beginning as this cannot be followed byany thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on thesubject.""""I insist on you hearing the whole of it,"" he replied, ""My fortune wasnever large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit ofassociating with people of better income than myself.  Every year sincemy coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; andthough the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yetthat event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been forsome time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying awoman of fortune.  To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was nota thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness,cruelty--which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, MissDashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting in this manner,trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it.--Butone thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfishvanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because Idid not THEN know what it was to love.  But have I ever known it?--Wellmay it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed myfeelings to vanity, to avarice?--or, what is more, could I havesacrificed hers?-- But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,which her affection and her society would have deprived of all itshorrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing thatcould make it a blessing.""""You did then,"" said Elinor, a little softened, ""believe yourself atone time attached to her?""""To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood suchtenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes, Ifound myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and thehappiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt myintentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.  EvenTHEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, Iallowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the momentof doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while mycircumstances were so greatly embarrassed.  I will not reason here--norwill I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse thanabsurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was alreadybound.  The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing withgreat circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myselfcontemptible and wretched for ever.  At last, however, my resolutionwas taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openlyassure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains todisplay.  But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours thatwere to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with herin private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruinall my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery tookplace,""--here he hesitated and looked down.--""Mrs. Smith had somehow orother been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interestit was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection--but Ineed not explain myself farther,"" he added, looking at her with anheightened colour and an enquiring eye--""your particular intimacy--youhave probably heard the whole story long ago.""""I have,"" returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heartanew against any compassion for him, ""I have heard it all.  And how youwill explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, Iconfess is beyond my comprehension.""""Remember,"" cried Willoughby, ""from whom you received the account.Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge that her situation and hercharacter ought to have been respected by me.  I do not mean to justifymyself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I havenothing to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.  If the violence ofher passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not mean,however, to defend myself.  Her affection for me deserved bettertreatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tendernesswhich, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.  Iwish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured more thanherself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me--(may I sayit?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind--Oh! howinfinitely superior!""--""Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must sayit, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may wellbe--your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her.  Donot think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect ofunderstanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself inDevonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she wasreduced to the extremest indigence.""""But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,"" he warmly replied; ""I did notrecollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sensemight have told her how to find it out.""""Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?""""She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may beguessed.  The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, herignorance of the world--every thing was against me.  The matter itselfI could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She waspreviously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct ingeneral, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in mypresent visit.  In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure Imight have saved myself.  In the height of her morality, good woman!she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza.  That couldnot be--and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--wasspent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be.  Thestruggle was great--but it ended too soon.  My affection for Marianne,my thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all insufficientto outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those falseideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined tofeel, and expensive society had increased.  I had reason to believemyself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and Ipersuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remainedfor me to do.  A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leaveDevonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; someapology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement.  Butwhether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was apoint of long debate.  To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, andI even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to myresolution.  In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable,and left her miserable--and left her hoping never to see her again.""""Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?"" said Elinor, reproachfully; ""a notewould have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call?""""It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear to leave thecountry in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of theneighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed betweenMrs. Smith and myself--and I resolved therefore on calling at thecottage, in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister, however,was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.You were all gone I do not know where.  I had left her only the eveningbefore, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!  Afew hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember howhappy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage toAllenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body!  But inthis, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a senseof guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling.  Hersorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I wasobliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I never shall forgetit--united too with such reliance, such confidence in me!--Oh,God!--what a hard-hearted rascal I was!""They were both silent for a few moments.  Elinor first spoke.""Did you tell her that you should soon return?""""I do not know what I told her,"" he replied, impatiently; ""less thanwas due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much morethan was justified by the future.  I cannot think of it.--It won'tdo.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all herkindness and confidence.  Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I wasmiserable.  Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort itgives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge to myselffor the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my pastsufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now.  Well, Iwent, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I wasonly indifferent.  My journey to town--travelling with my own horses,and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my own reflectionsso cheerful--when I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when Ilooked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessedjourney!""He stopped.""Well, sir,"" said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient forhis departure, ""and this is all?""""Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamousletter--Did she shew it you?""""Yes, I saw every note that passed.""""When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was intown the whole time,) what I felt is--in the common phrase, not to beexpressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise anyemotion--my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every wordwas--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,would forbid--a dagger to my heart.  To know that Marianne was in townwas--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts anddaggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste, heropinions--I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I amsure they are dearer.""Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of thisextraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt ither duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.""This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married.Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear.""""Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as informer days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had beenseparated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full offaith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I sayawakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had insome measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardenedvillain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy thatshe too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of ourpast attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up myshoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, 'I shall beheartily glad to hear she is well married.'-- But this note made meknow myself better.  I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me thanany other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously.  Butevery thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me.  To retreatwas impossible.  All that I had to do, was to avoid you both.  I sentno answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from herfarther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call inBerkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of acool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safelyout of the house one morning, and left my name.""""Watched us out of the house!""""Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, howoften I was on the point of falling in with you.  I have entered many ashop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I didin Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch aglimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constantwatchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keepout of your sight, could have separated us so long.  I avoided theMiddletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who waslikely to prove an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being intown, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of hiscoming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings's.  He asked meto a party, a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me asan inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should havefelt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.  The nextmorning brought another short note from Marianne--still affectionate,open, artless, confiding--everything that could make MY conduct mosthateful.  I could not answer it.  I tried--but could not frame asentence.  But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN.With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play thehappy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worsethan all.  Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced onme; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!--Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby insuch a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand to me, asking me for anexplanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speakingsolicitude on my face!--and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the otherhand, looking all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is overnow.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white asdeath.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--the lastmanner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid sight!--yet when Ithought of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to meto imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who sawher last in this world.  She was before me, constantly before me, as Itravelled, in the same look and hue.""A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.  Willoughby firstrousing himself, broke it thus:""Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister is certainly better,certainly out of danger?""""We are assured of it.""""Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne.""""But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing tosay about that?""""Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  Your sister wrote to me again, youknow, the very next morning.  You saw what she said.  I wasbreakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, wasbrought to me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch Sophia'seye before it caught mine--and its size, the elegance of the paper, thehand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vaguereport had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady inDevonshire, and what had passed within her observation the precedingevening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealousthan ever.  Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which isdelightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly,and read its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could haveborne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it must be appeased.And, in short--what do you think of my wife's style ofletter-writing?--delicate--tender--truly feminine--was it not?""""Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing.""""Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences asI was ashamed to put my name to.  The original was all her own--her ownhappy thoughts and gentle diction.  But what could I do!--we wereengaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But I amtalking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words, her moneywas necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to bedone to prevent a rupture.  And after all, what did it signify to mycharacter in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what languagemy answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end.  My businesswas to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or abluster was of little importance.-- 'I am ruined for ever in theiropinion--' said I to myself--'I am shut out for ever from theirsociety, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter willonly make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were my reasonings, as,in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife's words, andparted with the last relics of Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckilythey were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied theirexistence, and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up, andcould not even kiss them.  And the lock of hair--that too I had alwayscarried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched byMadam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock--all, everymemento was torn from me.""""You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,"" said Elinor, whileher voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate emotion;""you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or mysister.  You had made your own choice.  It was not forced on you.  Yourwife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least.  Shemust be attached to you, or she would not have married you.  To treather with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement toMarianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience.""""Do not talk to me of my wife,"" said he with a heavy sigh.-- ""She doesnot deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when wemarried.--Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to behappy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pityme, Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?-- Am I--beit only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion than I wasbefore?--My intentions were not always wrong.  Have I explained awayany part of my guilt?""""Yes, you have certainly removed something--a little.-- You have provedyourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you.  You haveproved your heart less wicked, much less wicked.  But I hardlyknow--the misery that you have inflicted--I hardly know what could havemade it worse.""""Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have beentelling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as wellas in yours.  You tell me that she has forgiven me already.  Let me beable to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my presentfeelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, moregentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  Tell her of my misery and mypenitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and ifyou will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever.""""I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively becalled, your justification.  But you have not explained to me theparticular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her illness.""""Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, andwhen he saw who I was--for the first time these two months--he spoke tome.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen withoutsurprise or resentment.  Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupidsoul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister,could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew oughtto--though probably he did not think it WOULD--vex me horridly.  Asbluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that MarianneDashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter thatmorning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger mostimminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c.--I was too muchshocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to theundiscerning Sir John.  His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer;and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, healmost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promiseabout a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing that your sister wasdying--and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,scorning, hating me in her latest moments--for how could I tell whathorrid projects might not have been imputed?  ONE person I was surewould represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt wasdreadful!--My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock thismorning I was in my carriage.  Now you know all.""Elinor made no answer.  Her thoughts were silently fixed on theirreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequenthabits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, thecharacter, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of personand talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and afeeling, affectionate temper.  The world had made him extravagant andvain--Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another,had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at leastits offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.  Each faultypropensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment.The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, againstevery better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when nolonger allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for thesake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery,was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far moreincurable nature.  From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at theend of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverieat least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, andsaid--""There is no use in staying here; I must be off.""""Are you going back to town?""""No--to Combe Magna.  I have business there; from thence to town in aday or two.  Good bye.""He held out his hand.  She could not refuse to give him hers;--hepressed it with affection.""And you DO think something better of me than you did?""--said he,letting it fall, and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgettinghe was to go.Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave, pitied, wished himwell--was even interested in his happiness--and added some gentlecounsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it.  His answer wasnot very encouraging.""As to that,"" said he, ""I must rub through the world as well as I can.Domestic happiness is out of the question.  If, however, I am allowedto think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, itmay be the means--it may put me on my guard--at least, it may besomething to live for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--""Elinor stopped him with a reproof.""Well,""--he replied--""once more good bye. I shall now go away and livein dread of one event.""""What do you mean?""""Your sister's marriage.""""You are very wrong.  She can never be more lost to you than she isnow.""""But she will be gained by some one else.  And if that some one shouldbe the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear--but I will notstay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing thatwhere I have most injured I can least forgive.  Good bye,--God blessyou!""And with these words, he almost ran out of the room."
Sense & Sensibility,45,"CHAPTER 45Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after thesound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by acrowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadnesswas the general result, to think even of her sister.Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the mostworthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited adegree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which madeher think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with atenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledgedwithin herself--to his wishes than to his merits.  She felt that hisinfluence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought notin reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, thatopen, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess;and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not eveninnocent to indulge.  But she felt that it was so, long, long beforeshe could feel his influence less.When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found herjust awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent ofher hopes.  Elinor's heart was full.  The past, the present, thefuture, Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her mother'sexpected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spiritswhich kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearfulof betraying herself to her sister.  Short was the time, however, inwhich that fear could affect her, for within half an hour afterWilloughby's leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by thesound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from everyunnecessary moment's horrible suspense, she ran immediately into thehall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and supporther as she entered it.Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had producedalmost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no voice toinquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neitherfor salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--and hermother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment as muchovercome by her happiness, as she had been before by her fears.  Shewas supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and herfriend;--and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable tospeak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervalsto press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at once hergratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the blissof the moment.  He shared it, however, in a silence even greater thanher own.As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was herfirst desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was onlychecked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farthersleep;--but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, whenthe life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowingher mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak forconversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed byevery nurse around her.  Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night;and Elinor, in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed.  Butthe rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of themost wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off byirritation of spirits.  Willoughby, ""poor Willoughby,"" as she nowallowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she wouldnot but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, nowacquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before.  But herpromise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful.  Shedreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Mariannemight be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever behappy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HISsufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival's, the rewardof her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.Willoughby's death.The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softenedto Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was heruneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set outfor Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any furtherintelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away,as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection.Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness ofMrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedlydeclared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.  Elinor couldnot hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimeswondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.  But Mrs.Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointmentwhich Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy tothink only of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to herfrom a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistakenjudgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, hadcontributed to place her;--and in her recovery she had yet anothersource of joy unthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her, assoon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.""At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet know all myhappiness.  Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.  He has told me so himself.""Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised andnot surprised, was all silent attention.""You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at yourcomposure now.  Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to myfamily, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you asthe object most desirable.  And I believe Marianne will be the mosthappy with him of the two.""Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, becausesatisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age,characters, or feelings, could be given;--but her mother must always becarried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, andtherefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.""He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.  It cameout quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  I, you may well believe, couldtalk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress; I sawthat it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship,as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather,not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible feelings,made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection forMarianne.  He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment ofseeing her.""Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the professionsof Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother'sactive fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose.""His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughbyever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere orconstant--which ever we are to call it--has subsisted through all theknowledge of dear Marianne's unhappy prepossession for that worthlessyoung man!--and without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--couldhe have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--such openness,such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM.""""Colonel Brandon's character,"" said Elinor, ""as an excellent man, iswell established.""""I know it is,""--replied her mother seriously, ""or after such a warning,I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be pleasedby it.  But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such readyfriendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men.""""His character, however,"" answered Elinor, ""does not rest on ONE act ofkindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of thecase, would have prompted him.  To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, hehas been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him;and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is veryconsiderable; and so highly do I value and esteem him, that if Mariannecan be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think ourconnection the greatest blessing to us in the world.  What answer didyou give him?--Did you allow him to hope?""""Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.Marianne might at that moment be dying.  But he did not ask for hope orencouragement.  His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressibleeffusion to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.  Yetafter a time I DID say, for at first I was quite overcome--that if shelived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie inpromoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightfulsecurity, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him everyencouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time, I tell him, willdo everything;--Marianne's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such aman as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it.""""To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however, you have not yet madehim equally sanguine.""""No.--He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply rooted for any changein it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart againfree, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such adifference of age and disposition he could ever attach her.  There,however, he is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond hers asto be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed;--andhis disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to makeyour sister happy.  And his person, his manners too, are all in hisfavour.  My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not sohandsome as Willoughby--but at the same time, there is something muchmore pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--ifyou remember,--in Willoughby's eyes at times, which I did not like.""Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother, without waiting for herassent, continued,""And his manners, the Colonel's manners are not only more pleasing tome than Willoughby's ever were, but they are of a kind I well know tobe more solidly attaching to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuineattention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is muchmore accordant with her real disposition, than the liveliness--oftenartificial, and often ill-timed of the other.  I am very sure myself,that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has provedhimself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy withHIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon.""She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but herdissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.""At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me,"" added Mrs.Dashwood, ""even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,--for Ihear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some smallhouse or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as ourpresent situation.""Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--buther spirit was stubborn.""His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know, everybody caresabout THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know, what itreally is, I am sure it must be a good one.""Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, andElinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to herfriend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby."
Sense & Sensibility,46,"CHAPTER 46Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been longenough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, andher mother's presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable herto remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs.Palmer's dressing-room.  When there, at her own particular request, forshe was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching hermother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and inreceiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, wassuch, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something more thanhis affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known toothers; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varyingcomplexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of manypast scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblancebetween Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthenedby the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, butwith a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to verydifferent effect, saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arosefrom the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actionsand words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that somethingmore than gratitude already dawned.At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly strongerevery twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and herdaughter's wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HERmeasures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could notquit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was soonbrought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there asequally determinate, if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs.Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on toaccept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the betteraccommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the jointinvitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-naturemade her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself,engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in thecourse of a few weeks.The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after takingso particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestlygrateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her ownheart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and biddingColonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefullyassisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that sheshould engross at least half.  Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, andfeel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaiseto take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two youngcompanions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took hissolitary way to Delaford.The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journeyon both, without essential fatigue.  Every thing that the most zealousaffection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their rewardin her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits.  To Elinor, theobservation of the latter was particularly grateful.  She, who had seenher week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish ofheart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude toconceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, anapparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trustedof serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment andcheerfulness.As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which everyfield and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from theirnotice, sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here, Elinorcould neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assistedMarianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only anemotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the whole of hersubsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened toreasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their commonsitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look ofresolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to thesight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could beconnected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away withoutthe atonement of a smile.  After dinner she would try her piano-forte.She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was anopera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of theirfavourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in hishand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head, put the musicaside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained offeebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaringhowever with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practicemuch.The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms.  On thecontrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she lookedand spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure ofMargaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which wouldthen be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as theonly happiness worth a wish.""When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,"" saidshe, ""we will take long walks together every day.  We will walk to thefarm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we willwalk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;and we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace itsfoundations as far as we are told they once reached.  I know we shallbe happy.  I know the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never tobe later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shalldivide every moment between music and reading.  I have formed my plan,and am determined to enter on a course of serious study.  Our ownlibrary is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyondmere amusement.  But there are many works well worth reading at thePark; and there are others of more modern production which I know I canborrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six hours a-day, I shallgain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction whichI now feel myself to want.""Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this;though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading herto the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at workin introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment andvirtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when sheremembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and fearedshe had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind ofMarianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busytranquillity.  Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolvedto wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she appointedit.  But the resolution was made only to be broken.Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather wasfine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out.  But at last asoft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter'swishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor'sarm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, inthe lane before the house.The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in anexercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they hadadvanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of thehill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turnedtowards it, Marianne calmly said,""There, exactly there,""--pointing with one hand, ""on that projectingmound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby.""Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,""I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on thespot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?""--hesitatingly itwas said.--""Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now, I hope, as Iought to do.""--Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.""As for regret,"" said Marianne, ""I have done with that, as far as HE isconcerned.  I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have beenfor him, but what they are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied onone point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS actinga part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all, if I could be assuredthat he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fanciedhim, since the story of that unfortunate girl""--She stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered,""If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy.""""Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;--for not only is ithorrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE has been to ME, ofsuch designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in asituation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection couldexpose me to""--""How then,"" asked her sister, ""would you account for his behaviour?""""I would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle,very, very fickle.""Elinor said no more.  She was debating within herself on theeligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it tillMarianne were in stronger health;--and they crept on for a few minutesin silence.""I am not wishing him too much good,"" said Marianne at last with asigh, ""when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasantthan my own.  He will suffer enough in them.""""Do you compare your conduct with his?""""No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it withyours.""""Our situations have borne little resemblance.""""They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not, my dearest Elinor, letyour kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure.  Myillness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness forserious recollection.  Long before I was enough recovered to talk, Iwas perfectly able to reflect.  I considered the past: I saw in my ownbehaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him lastautumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want ofkindness to others.  I saw that my own feelings had prepared mysufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led meto the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on bymyself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at thetime to be wrong.  Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. Idid not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with suchfeelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonderthat the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time foratonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had Idied,--in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, myfriend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of mylatter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How shouldI have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! How could you haveconsoled her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.  WheneverI looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failingindulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.  The kindness, theunceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungratefulcontempt.  To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to everycommon acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a hearthardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their veryattention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them, little as theydeserve, I had given less than their due.  But you,--you above all,above my mother, had been wronged by me.  I, and only I, knew yourheart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to anycompassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was beforeme; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort?Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by takingany part in those offices of general complaisance or particulargratitude which you had hitherto been left to dischargealone?--No;--not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I hadbelieved you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty orfriendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regrettingonly THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, forwhom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.""Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantlythat praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so welldeserved.  Marianne pressed her hand and replied,""You are very good.--The future must be my proof.  I have laid down myplan, and if I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall begoverned and my temper improved.  They shall no longer worry others,nor torture myself.  I shall now live solely for my family.  You, mymother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you willshare my affections entirely between you.  From you, from my home, Ishall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mixin other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, myheart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesserduties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.  As for Willoughby--tosay that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle.His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances oropinions.  But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion,by reason, by constant employment.""She paused--and added in a low voice, ""If I could but know HIS heart,everything would become easy.""Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety orimpropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at allnearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that asreflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herselfleading to the fact.She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared heranxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chiefpoints on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to hisrepentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes were fixed on theground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them.  Athousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urgeone.  She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears coveredher cheeks.Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till theyreached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiositymust be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothingbut Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefullyminute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness couldbe safely indulged.  As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with akiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through hertears, ""Tell mama,"" withdrew from her sister and walked slowly upstairs.  Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonableas what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging itsresult, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Mariannefail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her partinginjunction."
Sense & Sensibility,47,"CHAPTER 47Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her formerfavourite.  She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of hisimputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But thefeelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore himwith a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne.  Nothingcould do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through hismeans, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.  Nothingcould replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure theinterests of Colonel Brandon.Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story fromhimself--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influenceof his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassionwould have been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor inher wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailedexplanation, as had at first been called forth in herself.  Reflectionhad given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion ofWilloughby's deserts;--she wished, therefore, to declare only thesimple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to hischaracter, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancyastray.In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne beganvoluntarily to speak of him again;--but that it was not without aneffort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been forsome time previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--and herunsteady voice, plainly shewed.""I wish to assure you both,"" said she, ""that I see every thing--as youcan desire me to do.""Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothingtenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister'sunbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence.  Marianneslowly continued--""It is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I havenow heard exactly what I wished to hear.""--For some moments her voicewas lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmnessthan before--""I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change.  Inever could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or laterI must have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence, noesteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings.""""I know it--I know it,"" cried her mother.  ""Happy with a man oflibertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearestof our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heartto be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her sensitiveconscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husbandought to have felt.""Marianne sighed, and repeated, ""I wish for no change.""""You consider the matter,"" said Elinor, ""exactly as a good mind and asound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, aswell as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved youin many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would havebeen poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.Had you married, you must have been always poor.  His expensiveness isacknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares thatself-denial is a word hardly understood by him.  His demands and yourinexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have broughton distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from havingbeen entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense of honourand honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation,to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and,perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--and howlittle could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruinwhich had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT, had youendeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it notto be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish toconsent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,and made him regret the connection which had involved him in suchdifficulties?""Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word ""Selfish?"" in atone that implied--""do you really think him selfish?""""The whole of his behaviour,"" replied Elinor, ""from the beginning tothe end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness.  It wasselfishness which first made him sport with your affections; whichafterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession ofit, and which finally carried him from Barton.  His own enjoyment, orhis own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.""""It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.""""At present,"" continued Elinor, ""he regrets what he has done.  And whydoes he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towardshimself.  It has not made him happy.  His circumstances are nowunembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks onlythat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.But does it follow that had he married you, he would have beenhappy?--The inconveniences would have been different.  He would thenhave suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they areremoved, he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife of whosetemper he could make no complaint, but he would have been alwaysnecessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rankthe innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of farmore importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of awife.""""I have not a doubt of it,"" said Marianne; ""and I have nothing toregret--nothing but my own folly.""""Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child,"" said Mrs. Dashwood;""SHE must be answerable.""Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that eachfelt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that mightweaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the firstsubject, immediately continued,""One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of thestory--that all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the firstoffence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crimehas been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his presentdiscontents.""Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was ledby it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon's injuries and merits, warmas friendship and design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did notlook, however, as if much of it were heard by her.Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three followingdays, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done;but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appearcheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of timeupon her health.Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to eachother, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing theirusual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came toBarton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.  She had heardnothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,nothing certain even of his present abode.  Some letters had passedbetween her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; andin the first of John's, there had been this sentence:-- ""We knownothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on soprohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford;"" whichwas all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; andwhen, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of hismistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntarycommunication--""I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.""Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw herturning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood,whose eyes, as she answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitivelytaken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor'scountenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,alike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child tobestow her principal attention.The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had senseenough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance,supported her into the other room.  By that time, Marianne was ratherbetter, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and themaid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so farrecovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning aninquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwoodimmediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had thebenefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.""Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?""""I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning in Exeter, and his ladytoo, Miss Steele as was.  They was stopping in a chaise at the door ofthe New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at thePark to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look upas I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest MissSteele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, andinquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies, especially MissMarianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's,their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had nottime to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to goforwards, for they was going further down for a little while, buthowsever, when they come back, they'd make sure to come and see you.""""But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?""""Yes, ma'am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name sinceshe was in these parts.  She was always a very affable and free-spokenyoung lady, and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy.""""Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?""""Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not lookup;--he never was a gentleman much for talking.""Elinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himselfforward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.""Was there no one else in the carriage?""""No, ma'am, only they two.""""Do you know where they came from?""""They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.""""And are they going farther westward?""""Yes, ma'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon be back again, andthen they'd be sure and call here.""Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better thanto expect them.  She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, andwas very confident that Edward would never come near them.  Sheobserved in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably goingdown to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.Thomas's intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked as if she wished tohear more.""Did you see them off, before you came away?""""No, ma'am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide anylonger; I was afraid of being late.""""Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?""""Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she wasalways a very handsome young lady--and she seemed vastly contented.""Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and thetablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaretmight think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as bothher sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had oftenhad to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to gowithout her dinner before.When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood andElinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in asimilarity of thoughtfulness and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared tohazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation.  She nowfound that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation ofherself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expresslysoftened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne.  She found that shehad been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of herdaughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so wellunderstood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont tobelieve, or than it was now proved to be.  She feared that under thispersuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to herElinor;--that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged, moreimmediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and ledher away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter sufferingalmost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greaterfortitude."
Sense & Sensibility,48,"CHAPTER 48Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of anunpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,and certainty itself.  She now found, that in spite of herself, she hadalways admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that somethingwould occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of hisown, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity ofestablishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurkingflattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be inorders, and consequently before he could be in possession of theliving, surprised her a little at first.  But she soon saw how likelyit was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to securehim, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.  They weremarried, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle's.  Whathad Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing hermother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message!They would soon, she supposed, be settled at Delaford.--Delaford,--thatplace in which so much conspired to give her an interest; which shewished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.  She saw themin an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active,contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance withthe utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half hereconomical practices;--pursuing her own interest in every thought,courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of everywealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew not what she saw, nor what shewished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing pleased her; she turned awayher head from every sketch of him.Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in Londonwould write to them to announce the event, and give fartherparticulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, notidings.  Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found faultwith every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless or indolent.""When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?"" was an inquiry whichsprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.""I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than tohear from him again.  I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and shouldnot be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.""This was gaining something, something to look forward to.  ColonelBrandon must have some information to give.Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man onhorseback drew her eyes to the window.  He stopt at their gate.  It wasa gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more;and she trembled in expectation of it.  But--it was NOT ColonelBrandon--neither his air--nor his height.  Were it possible, she mustsay it must be Edward.  She looked again.  He had just dismounted;--shecould not be mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.""He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us.  I WILL be calm; I WILLbe mistress of myself.""In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of themistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them lookat herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other.  She would havegiven the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand thatshe hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour tohim;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to theirown discretion.Not a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited in silence for theappearance of their visitor.  His footsteps were heard along the gravelpath; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was beforethem.His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even forElinor.  His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as iffearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes ofthat daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to beguided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave himher hand, and wished him joy.He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.  Elinor's lipshad moved with her mother's, and, when the moment of action was over,she wished that she had shaken hands with him too.  But it was then toolate, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again andtalked of the weather.Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal herdistress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole ofthe case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and thereforetook a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a strictsilence.When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a veryawful pause took place.  It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, whofelt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In ahurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.Another pause.Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her ownvoice, now said,""Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?""""At Longstaple!"" he replied, with an air of surprise.-- ""No, my motheris in town.""""I meant,"" said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, ""to inquirefor Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.""She dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned theireyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,after some hesitation, said,--""Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars.""""Mrs. Robert Ferrars!""--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in anaccent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder.  Herose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from notknowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, andwhile spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter topieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,""Perhaps you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother islately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele.""His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of suchagitation as made her hardly know where she was.""Yes,"" said he, ""they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish.""Elinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran out of the room, and assoon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at firstshe thought would never cease.  Edward, who had till then looked anywhere, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--or evenheard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie,which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quittedthe room, and walked out towards the village--leaving the others in thegreatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, sowonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means oflessening but by their own conjectures."
Sense & Sensibility,49,"CHAPTER 49Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release mightappear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and towhat purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determinedby all;--for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudentengagement, contracted without his mother's consent, as he had alreadydone for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him inthe failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another.His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.  It was only to askElinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogetherinexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he shouldfeel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much inneed of encouragement and fresh air.How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, howsoon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner heexpressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularlytold.  This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table atfour o'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured hislady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturousprofession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, oneof the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was more than commonlyjoyful.  He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love toswell his heart, and raise his spirits.  He was released without anyreproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed hismisery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--and elevated atonce to that security with another, which he must have thought ofalmost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it withdesire.  He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery tohappiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed inhim before.His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errorsconfessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all thephilosophic dignity of twenty-four.""It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side,"" said he, ""theconsequence of ignorance of the world--and want of employment.  Had mymother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteenfrom the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure, it would neverhave happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at thetime, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then hadany pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distancefrom her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fanciedattachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case Imust have done.  But instead of having any thing to do, instead ofhaving any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse anymyself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the firsttwelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, whichbelonging to the university would have given me; for I was not enteredat Oxford till I was nineteen.  I had therefore nothing in the world todo, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my homein every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in mybrother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me tobe very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, andwas always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest partof my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everythingthat was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty too--at least I thoughtso THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make nocomparisons, and see no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, Ihope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in everyway been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusablepiece of folly.""The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happinessof the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, thesatisfaction of a sleepless night.  Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to becomfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, howto be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversationtogether, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.  Comparisons wouldoccur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her lovefor her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment oflearning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to themoment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, shewas every thing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment hadpassed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, comparedher situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourablyreleased from his former engagement, saw him instantly profiting by therelease, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, asconstant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed, she wasovercome by her own felicity;--and happily disposed as is the humanmind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, itrequired several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degreeof tranquillity to her heart.Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whateverother claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than aweek should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, orsuffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, andthe future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor ofincessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be incommon between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it isdifferent.  Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication iseven made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--andElinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her inevery view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountablecircumstances she had ever heard.  How they could be thrown together,and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, ofwhose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--agirl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account thatbrother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond hercomprehension to make out.  To her own heart it was a delightfulaffair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to herreason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so workedon by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of hisopinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might havedone, if applied to in time.  She repeated it to Edward.""THAT was exactly like Robert,""--was his immediate observation.--""AndTHAT,"" he presently added, ""might perhaps be in HIS head when theacquaintance between them first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first mightthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour.  Other designsmight afterward arise.""How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equallyat a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he hadremained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no meansof hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very lastwere neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.  Not thesmallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him forwhat followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucyherself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified betweenthe wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.  He put theletter into Elinor's hands.     ""DEAR SIR,     ""Being very sure I have long lost your affections,     I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own     on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with     him as I once used to think I might be with you;     but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was     another's.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always     good friends, as our near relationship now makes     proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any     ill offices.  Your brother has gained my affections     entirely, and as we could not live without one     another, we are just returned from the altar, and     are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,     but thought I would first trouble you with these     few lines, and shall always remain,     ""Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister,                                        ""LUCY FERRARS.     ""I have burnt all your letters, and will return     your picture the first opportunity.  Please to destroy     my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very     welcome to keep.""Elinor read and returned it without any comment.""I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,"" saidEdward.--""For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOUin former days.--In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!--how Ihave blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may saythat since the first half year of our foolish--business--this is theonly letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made meany amends for the defect of the style.""""However it may have come about,"" said Elinor, after a pause,--""theyare certainly married.  And your mother has brought on herself a mostappropriate punishment.  The independence she settled on Robert,through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his ownchoice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousanda-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other forintending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert'smarrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.""""She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.--Shewill be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive himmuch sooner.""In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knewnot, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attemptedby him.  He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours afterLucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearestroad to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, withwhich that road did not hold the most intimate connection.  He could donothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by hisrapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of thejealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite ofthe modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politenesswith which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expecta very cruel reception.  It was his business, however, to say that heDID, and he said it very prettily.  What he might say on the subject atwelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands andwives.That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish ofmalice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear toElinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on hercharacter, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmostmeanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened,even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and awant of liberality in some of her opinions--they had been equallyimputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letterreached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed,good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.  Nothing butsuch a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to anengagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to hismother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret tohim.""I thought it my duty,"" said he, ""independent of my feelings, to giveher the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I wasrenounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend inthe world to assist me.  In such a situation as that, where thereseemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any livingcreature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmlyinsisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing butthe most disinterested affection was her inducement?  And even now, Icannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantageit could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not thesmallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.""""No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;that your own family might in time relent.  And at any rate, she lostnothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that itfettered neither her inclination nor her actions.  The connection wascertainly a respectable one, and probably gained her considerationamong her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it wouldbe better for her to marry YOU than be single.""Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could havebeen more natural than Lucy's conduct, nor more self-evident than themotive of it.Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence whichcompliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them atNorland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.""Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,"" said she; ""because--to saynothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it tofancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be.""He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistakenconfidence in the force of his engagement.""I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted toanother, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that theconsciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacredas my honour.  I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was onlyfriendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself andLucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that, I suppose, I WASwrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which Ireconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better thanthese:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody butmyself.""Elinor smiled, and shook her head.Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's being expected at theCottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him,but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resentedhis giving him the living of Delaford--""Which, at present,"" said he,""after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion,he must think I have never forgiven him for offering.""NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place.But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed all hisknowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish,condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, whohad heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so muchattention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.One question after this only remained undecided, between them, onedifficulty only was to be overcome.  They were brought together bymutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happinesscertain--and they only wanted something to live upon.  Edward had twothousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was allthat they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quiteenough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-yearwould supply them with the comforts of life.Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in hismother towards him; and on THAT he rested for the residue of theirincome.  But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward wouldstill be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had beenspoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser evilthan his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offence wouldserve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, tocomplete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her the dignity ofhaving, for the first time since her living at Barton, more companywith her than her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain theprivilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked everynight to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returnedin the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tetebefore breakfast.A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours atleast, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion betweenthirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mindwhich needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindnessof her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother's language, tomake it cheerful.  Among such friends, however, and such flattery, hedid revive.  No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knewnothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit wereconsequently spent in hearing and in wondering.  Every thing wasexplained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoicein what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted theinterest of Elinor.It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the goodopinion of each other, as they advanced in each other's acquaintance,for it could not be otherwise.  Their resemblance in good principlesand good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probablyhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any otherattraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sistersfond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.The letters from town, which a few days before would have made everynerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be readwith less emotion than mirth.  Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell thewonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jiltinggirl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, shewas sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by allaccounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.-- ""I do think,"" shecontinued, ""nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two daysbefore Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soulsuspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!  camecrying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars,as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seemsborrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose wesuppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings inthe world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take herdown to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks withMrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctoragain.  And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them alongwith them in the chaise is worse than all.  Poor Mr. Edward! I cannotget him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton, and MissMarianne must try to comfort him.""Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.  Mrs. Ferrars was the mostunfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies ofsensibility--and he considered the existence of each, under such ablow, with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence was unpardonable, butLucy's was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were ever again to bementioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be inducedto forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as herdaughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy withwhich everything had been carried on between them, was rationallytreated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicionof it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken toprevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him inregretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not rather beenfulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading miseryfarther in the family.-- He thus continued:""Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's name, which does notsurprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has beenreceived from him on the occasion.  Perhaps, however, he is kept silentby his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by aline to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of propersubmission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn toher mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness ofMrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to beon good terms with her children.""This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct ofEdward.  It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though notexactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.""A letter of proper submission!"" repeated he; ""would they have me begmy mother's pardon for Robert's ingratitude to HER, and breach ofhonour to ME?--I can make no submission--I am grown neither humble norpenitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy; but that would notinterest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make.""""You may certainly ask to be forgiven,"" said Elinor, ""because you haveoffended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as toprofess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drewon you your mother's anger.""He agreed that he might.""And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may beconvenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudentin HER eyes as the first.""He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of aletter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him,as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions byword of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writingto Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her goodoffices in his favour.-- ""And if they really DO interest themselves,""said Marianne, in her new character of candour, ""in bringing about areconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirelywithout merit.""After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of only three or four days, thetwo gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately toDelaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his futurehome, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvementswere needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple ofnights, he was to proceed on his journey to town."
Sense & Sensibility,50,"CHAPTER 50After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violentand so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she alwaysseemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edwardwas admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.  For many years ofher life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edwarda few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation ofRobert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by theresuscitation of Edward, she had one again.In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did notfeel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed hispresent engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, hefeared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him offas rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution therefore it wasrevealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness.  Mrs.Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marryingMiss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in MissMorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--andenforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughterof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was onlythe daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but whenshe found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of herrepresentation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, shejudged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--andtherefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her owndignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, sheissued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next tobe considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was nowher only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert wasinevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallestobjection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of twohundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either forthe present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which hadbeen given with Fanny.It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, byEdward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of theliving, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, withan eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was makingconsiderable improvements; and after waiting some time for theircompletion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointmentsand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marryingtill every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Bartonchurch early in the autumn.The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at theMansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of theParsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--couldchuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jennings'sprophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; forshe was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage byMichaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she reallybelieved, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in factnothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,and rather better pasturage for their cows.They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relationsand friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she wasalmost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at theexpense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.""I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,"" said John, asthey were walking together one morning before the gates of DelafordHouse, ""THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been oneof the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, Iconfess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandonbrother.  His property here, his place, his house, every thing is insuch respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have notseen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing inDelaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactlythe person to attract him--yet I think it would altogether be advisablefor you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as ColonelBrandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what mayhappen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little ofanybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her off toadvantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her achance--You understand me.""--But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated themwith the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted byher real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before manymonths had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which hadat first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument ofhis deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduousattentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening wasgiven for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, andre-established him completely in her favour.The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity whichcrowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instanceof what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, howeverits progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing everyadvantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time andconscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privatelyvisited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputedto him by his brother.  He merely meant to persuade her to give up theengagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affectionof both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settlethe matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he erred;--forthough Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince herin TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted toproduce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her mind whenthey parted, which could only be removed by another half hour'sdiscourse with himself.  His attendance was by this means secured, andthe rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they camegradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had alwaysmore to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed aninterest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedilyevident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He wasproud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud ofmarrying privately without his mother's consent.  What immediatelyfollowed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness atDawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--andhe drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thencereturning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by thesimple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, wasadopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty andtherefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weekslonger unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct andmessages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude forthe unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughtynotice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny;and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intendedto marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth,was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, andalways openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled intown, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on thebest terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside thejealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequentdomestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothingcould exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might havepuzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed toit, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothingever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give asuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leavinghis brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edwardmight be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in everyparticular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, andfrom the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed noless contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of anexchange.Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could wellbe contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time withher.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasurein the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringingMarianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, thoughrather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now herdarling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to hervalued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house wasequally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, andtheir own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be thereward of all.With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate ofhis goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,which at last, though long after it was observable to everybodyelse--burst on her--what could she do?Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She was born todiscover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by herconduct, her most favourite maxims.  She was born to overcome anaffection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentimentsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to giveher hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no lessthan herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two yearsbefore, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still soughtthe constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!But so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistiblepassion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--insteadof remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her onlypleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm andsober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at nineteen,submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a newhome, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every pastaffliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation,and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her ownhappiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight ofeach observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves; and herwhole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it hadonce been to Willoughby.Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and hispunishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness ofMrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, asthe source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had hebehaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happyand rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought itsown punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he longthought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  Butthat he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, orcontracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, mustnot be depended on--for he did neither.  He lived to exert, andfrequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree ofdomestic felicity.For Marianne, however--in spite of his incivility in surviving herloss--he always retained that decided regard which interested him inevery thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard ofperfection in woman;--and many a rising beauty would be slighted by himin after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, withoutattempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached anage highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for beingsupposed to have a lover.Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communicationwhich strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among themerits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be rankedas the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almostwithin sight of each other, they could live without disagreementbetween themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.THE END"
Pride & Prejudice,0,PRIDE AND PREJUDICEBy Jane Austen
Pride & Prejudice,1,"Chapter 1It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possessionof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on hisfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the mindsof the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful propertyof some one or other of their daughters.""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" said his lady to him one day, ""have you heard thatNetherfield Park is let at last?""Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.""But it is,"" returned she; ""for Mrs. Long has just been here, and shetold me all about it.""Mr. Bennet made no answer.""Do you not want to know who has taken it?"" cried his wife impatiently.""_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.""This was invitation enough.""Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is takenby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he camedown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so muchdelighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that heis to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are tobe in the house by the end of next week.""""What is his name?""""Bingley.""""Is he married or single?""""Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four orfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!""""How so? How can it affect them?""""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" replied his wife, ""how can you be so tiresome! Youmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""""Is that his design in settling here?""""Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him assoon as he comes.""""I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may sendthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you areas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of theparty.""""My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, butI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has fivegrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.""""In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.""""But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes intothe neighbourhood.""""It is more than I engage for, I assure you.""""But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it wouldbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined togo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit nonewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ tovisit him if you do not.""""You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be veryglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of myhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; thoughI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.""""I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than theothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half sogood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.""""They have none of them much to recommend them,"" replied he; ""they areall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more ofquickness than her sisters.""""Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? Youtake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.""""You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. Theyare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with considerationthese last twenty years at least.""""Ah, you do not know what I suffer.""""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of fourthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.""""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will notvisit them.""""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit themall.""Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years hadbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mindwas less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get herdaughters married; its solace was visiting and news."
Pride & Prejudice,2,"Chapter 2Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. Hehad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuringhis wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit waspaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the followingmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, hesuddenly addressed her with:""I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.""""We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"" said her motherresentfully, ""since we are not to visit.""""But you forget, mamma,"" said Elizabeth, ""that we shall meet him at theassemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.""""I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two niecesof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinionof her.""""No more have I,"" said Mr. Bennet; ""and I am glad to find that you donot depend on her serving you.""Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to containherself, began scolding one of her daughters.""Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a littlecompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.""""Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,"" said her father; ""she timesthem ill.""""I do not cough for my own amusement,"" replied Kitty fretfully. ""When isyour next ball to be, Lizzy?""""To-morrow fortnight.""""Aye, so it is,"" cried her mother, ""and Mrs. Long does not come backtill the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,for she will not know him herself.""""Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduceMr. Bingley to _her_.""""Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with himmyself; how can you be so teasing?""""I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainlyvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of afortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, asshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I willtake it on myself.""The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, ""Nonsense,nonsense!""""What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"" cried he. ""Doyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid onthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and readgreat books and make extracts.""Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.""While Mary is adjusting her ideas,"" he continued, ""let us return to Mr.Bingley.""""I am sick of Mr. Bingley,"" cried his wife.""I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? IfI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have calledon him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, wecannot escape the acquaintance now.""The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joywas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all thewhile.""How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I shouldpersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well toneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such agood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said aword about it till now.""""Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,"" said Mr. Bennet; and,as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.""What an excellent father you have, girls!"" said she, when the door wasshut. ""I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not sopleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; butfor your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the nextball.""""Oh!"" said Lydia stoutly, ""I am not afraid; for though I _am_ theyoungest, I'm the tallest.""The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he wouldreturn Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him todinner."
Pride & Prejudice,3,"Chapter 3Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her fivedaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from herhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked himin various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, anddistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were atlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had beendelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremelyagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assemblywith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond ofdancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very livelyhopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.""If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,""said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, ""and all the others equally wellmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.""In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat aboutten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of beingadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he hadheard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat morefortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upperwindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and alreadyhad Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to herhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingleywas obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unableto accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quitedisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in townso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear thathe might be always flying about from one place to another, and neversettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fearsa little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to geta large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingleywas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted theday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought onlysix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And whenthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only fivealtogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, andanother young man.Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasantcountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merelylooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, andthe report which was in general circulation within five minutesafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemenpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared hewas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to beproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not allhis large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a mostforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be comparedwith his friend.Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of givingone himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak forthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy dancedonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined beingintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening inwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable manin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughters.Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sitdown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friendto join it.""Come, Darcy,"" said he, ""I must have you dance. I hate to see youstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much betterdance.""""I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I amparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as thisit would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is notanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me tostand up with.""""I would not be so fastidious as you are,"" cried Mr. Bingley, ""for akingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls inmy life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you seeuncommonly pretty.""""_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"" said Mr.Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.""Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and Idare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.""""Which do you mean?"" and turning round he looked for a moment atElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:""She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy hersmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.""Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfieldparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had beendistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this asher mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane'spleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had beenfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that theyhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in goodspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which theywere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. Witha book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views onthe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had adifferent story to hear.""Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,"" as she entered the room, ""we have had a mostdelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how wellshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced withher twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with hertwice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a secondtime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him standup with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobodycan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was goingdown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, andasked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--""""If he had had any compassion for _me_,"" cried her husband impatiently,""he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more ofhis partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!""""Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessivelyhandsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life sawanything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.Hurst's gown--""Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against anydescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and someexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.""But I can assure you,"" she added, ""that Lizzy does not lose much by notsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not atall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduringhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so verygreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, mydear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."""
Pride & Prejudice,4,"Chapter 4When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious inher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how verymuch she admired him.""He is just what a young man ought to be,"" said she, ""sensible,good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so muchease, with such perfect good breeding!""""He is also handsome,"" replied Elizabeth, ""which a young man oughtlikewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.""""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. Idid not expect such a compliment.""""Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference betweenus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. Whatcould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not helpseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other womanin the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly isvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many astupider person.""""Dear Lizzy!""""Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeablein your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in yourlife.""""I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speakwhat I think.""""I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense ofothers! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with iteverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take thegood of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothingof the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.""""Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when youconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keephis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charmingneighbour in her.""Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with morequickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, shewas very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fineladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in thepower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud andconceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of thefirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousandpounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and ofassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respectentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were ofa respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeplyimpressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and theirown had been acquired by trade.Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase anestate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, andsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with agood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of thosewho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation topurchase.His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who hadmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to considerhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been ofage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendationto look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it forhalf-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principalrooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took itimmediately.Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite ofgreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by theeasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no dispositioncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own henever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingleyhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no meansdeficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were notinviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continuallygiving offense.The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people orprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentiveto him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon feltacquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could notconceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen acollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, fornone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none receivedeither attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,but she smiled too much.Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admiredher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and onewhom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chose."
Pride & Prejudice,5,"Chapter 5Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennetswere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in tradein Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him adisgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a houseabout a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to allthe world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render himsupercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. Bynature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.James's had made him courteous.Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be avaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldestof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, wasElizabeth's intimate friend.That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk overa ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assemblybrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.""_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,"" said Mrs. Bennet with civilself-command to Miss Lucas. ""_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.""""Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.""""Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To besure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--somethingabout Mr. Robinson.""""Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did notI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Merytonassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great manypretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and hisanswering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'""""Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem asif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.""""_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,"" saidCharlotte. ""Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.""""I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by hisill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quitea misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that hesat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.""""Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"" said Jane.""I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.""""Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and hecould not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry atbeing spoke to.""""Miss Bingley told me,"" said Jane, ""that he never speaks much,unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkablyagreeable.""""I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so veryagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how itwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he hadheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come tothe ball in a hack chaise.""""I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,"" said Miss Lucas, ""but Iwish he had danced with Eliza.""""Another time, Lizzy,"" said her mother, ""I would not dance with _him_,if I were you.""""I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.""""His pride,"" said Miss Lucas, ""does not offend _me_ so much as prideoften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that sovery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_to be proud.""""That is very true,"" replied Elizabeth, ""and I could easily forgive_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.""""Pride,"" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections, ""is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I haveever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that humannature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of uswho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of somequality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are differentthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person maybe proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion ofourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.""""If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,"" cried a young Lucas, who came withhis sisters, ""I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack offoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.""""Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,"" said Mrs.Bennet; ""and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottledirectly.""The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that shewould, and the argument ended only with the visit."
Pride & Prejudice,6,"Chapter 6The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visitwas soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew onthe goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother wasfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towardsthe two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatestpleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatmentof everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising inall probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. Itwas generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her andto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in away to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Janeunited, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and auniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicionsof the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.""It may perhaps be pleasant,"" replied Charlotte, ""to be able to imposeon the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to beso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skillfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; andit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally inthe dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost everyattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there arevery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love withoutencouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but hemay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.""""But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I canperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not todiscover it too.""""Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.""""But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to concealit, he must find it out.""""Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Janemeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as theyalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible thatevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane shouldtherefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command hisattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure forfalling in love as much as she chooses.""""Your plan is a good one,"" replied Elizabeth, ""where nothing is inquestion but the desire of being well married, and if I were determinedto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. Butthese are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of itsreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced fourdances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quiteenough to make her understand his character.""""Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she mightonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you mustremember that four evenings have also been spent together--and fourevenings may do a great deal.""""Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that theyboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any otherleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.""""Well,"" said Charlotte, ""I wish Jane success with all my heart; andif she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. Ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other orever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in theleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlife.""""You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is notsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.""Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at theball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But nosooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardlyhad a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. Tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Ofthis she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance with.He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversingwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing sodrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party wereassembled.""What does Mr. Darcy mean,"" said she to Charlotte, ""by listening to myconversation with Colonel Forster?""""That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.""""But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I seewhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin bybeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.""On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to haveany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention sucha subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, sheturned to him and said:""Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonlywell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball atMeryton?""""With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a ladyenergetic.""""You are severe on us.""""It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,"" said Miss Lucas. ""I am goingto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.""""You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting meto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had takena musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I wouldreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit ofhearing the very best performers."" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,she added, ""Very well, if it must be so, it must."" And gravely glancingat Mr. Darcy, ""There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is ofcourse familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and Ishall keep mine to swell my song.""Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a songor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several thatshe would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by hersister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one inthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was alwaysimpatient for display.Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given herapplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceitedmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than shehad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to withmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at theend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude byScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly indancing at one end of the room.Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode ofpassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was toomuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas washis neighbour, till Sir William thus began:""What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! Thereis nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the firstrefinements of polished society.""""Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongstthe less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.""Sir William only smiled. ""Your friend performs delightfully,"" hecontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; ""and I doubtnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.""""You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.""""Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Doyou often dance at St. James's?""""Never, sir.""""Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?""""It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.""""You have a house in town, I conclude?""Mr. Darcy bowed.""I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fondof superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air ofLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.""He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposedto make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he wasstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out toher:""My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allowme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. Youcannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.""And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, thoughextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantlydrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:""Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat younot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.""Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour ofher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William atall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.""You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to denyme the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes theamusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige usfor one half-hour.""""Mr. Darcy is all politeness,"" said Elizabeth, smiling.""He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such apartner?""Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had notinjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with somecomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:""I can guess the subject of your reverie.""""I should imagine not.""""You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many eveningsin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--thenothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What wouldI give to hear your strictures on them!""""Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was moreagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasurewhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.""Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired hewould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:""Miss Elizabeth Bennet.""""Miss Elizabeth Bennet!"" repeated Miss Bingley. ""I am all astonishment.How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish youjoy?""""That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady'simagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from loveto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.""""Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter isabsolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.""He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose toentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced herthat all was safe, her wit flowed long."
Pride & Prejudice,7,"Chapter 7Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of twothousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother'sfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supplythe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, andhad left her four thousand pounds.She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk totheir father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled inLondon in a respectable line of trade.The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a mostconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually temptedthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt andto a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothingbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morninghours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of newsthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn somefrom their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both withnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in theneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was theheadquarters.Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the mostinteresting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledgeof the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long asecret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store offelicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; andMr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animationto their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to theregimentals of an ensign.After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.Bennet coolly observed:""From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be twoof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, butI am now convinced.""Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfectindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going thenext morning to London.""I am astonished, my dear,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""that you should be soready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightinglyof anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.""""If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.""""Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.""""This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. Ihad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I mustso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonlyfoolish.""""My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense oftheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they willnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time whenI liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at myheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thoughtColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's inhis regimentals.""""Mamma,"" cried Lydia, ""my aunt says that Colonel Forster and CaptainCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they firstcame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.""Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman witha note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waitedfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she waseagerly calling out, while her daughter read,""Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.""""It is from Miss Bingley,"" said Jane, and then read it aloud.""MY DEAR FRIEND,--""If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without aquarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and thegentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,""CAROLINE BINGLEY""""With the officers!"" cried Lydia. ""I wonder my aunt did not tell us of_that_.""""Dining out,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""that is very unlucky.""""Can I have the carriage?"" said Jane.""No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely torain; and then you must stay all night.""""That would be a good scheme,"" said Elizabeth, ""if you were sure thatthey would not offer to send her home.""""Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.""""I had much rather go in the coach.""""But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They arewanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?""""They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.""""But if you have got them to-day,"" said Elizabeth, ""my mother's purposewill be answered.""She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horseswere engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and hermother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of abad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long beforeit rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother wasdelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;Jane certainly could not come back.""This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"" said Mrs. Bennet more thanonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till thenext morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of hercontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfieldbrought the following note for Elizabeth:""MY DEAREST LIZZY,--""I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to beimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will nothear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having beento me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much thematter with me.--Yours, etc.""""Well, my dear,"" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the notealoud, ""if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if sheshould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit ofMr. Bingley, and under your orders.""""Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little triflingcolds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it isall very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.""Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, thoughthe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walkingwas her only alternative. She declared her resolution.""How can you be so silly,"" cried her mother, ""as to think of such athing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you getthere.""""I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.""""Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,"" said her father, ""to send for thehorses?""""No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothingwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.""""I admire the activity of your benevolence,"" observed Mary, ""but everyimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.""""We will go as far as Meryton with you,"" said Catherine and Lydia.Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set offtogether.""If we make haste,"" said Lydia, as they walked along, ""perhaps we maysee something of Captain Carter before he goes.""In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of oneof the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossingfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springingover puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at lastwithin view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a faceglowing with the warmth of exercise.She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane wereassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in suchdirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst andMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contemptfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in theirbrother's manners there was something better than politeness; therewas good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of thebrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt asto the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter wasthinking only of his breakfast.Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. MissBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and notwell enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to herimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of givingalarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longedfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left themtogether, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for theextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attendedher.When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabethbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection andsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and havingexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caughta violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advicewas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her headached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor werethe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, infact, nothing to do elsewhere.When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and veryunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she onlywanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concernin parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offerof the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched toLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supplyof clothes."
Pride & Prejudice,8,"Chapter 8At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past sixElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which thenpoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing themuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a veryfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearingthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, howshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and theirindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restoredElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and hisattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley wasengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only toeat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plaindish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners werepronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought thesame, and added:""She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellentwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She reallylooked almost wild.""""She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Verynonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about thecountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!""""Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deepin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down tohide it not doing its office.""""Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,"" said Bingley; ""but this wasall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkablywell when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quiteescaped my notice.""""_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"" said Miss Bingley; ""and I aminclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make suchan exhibition.""""Certainly not.""""To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean byit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,a most country-town indifference to decorum.""""It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,"" saidBingley.""I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,"" observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, ""thatthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.""""Not at all,"" he replied; ""they were brightened by the exercise."" Ashort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:""I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a verysweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But withsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there isno chance of it.""""I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney inMeryton.""""Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.""""That is capital,"" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.""If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,"" cried Bingley, ""itwould not make them one jot less agreeable.""""But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world,"" replied Darcy.To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friend's vulgar relations.With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room onleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, tilllate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, andwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should godownstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the wholeparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspectingthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister theexcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could staybelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.""Do you prefer reading to cards?"" said he; ""that is rather singular.""""Miss Eliza Bennet,"" said Miss Bingley, ""despises cards. She is a greatreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.""""I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,"" cried Elizabeth; ""I am_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.""""In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,"" said Bingley; ""andI hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.""Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards thetable where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch herothers--all that his library afforded.""And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have morethan I ever looked into.""Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room.""I am astonished,"" said Miss Bingley, ""that my father should have leftso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have atPemberley, Mr. Darcy!""""It ought to be good,"" he replied, ""it has been the work of manygenerations.""""And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buyingbooks.""""I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days asthese.""""Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may behalf as delightful as Pemberley.""""I wish it may.""""But I would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not afiner county in England than Derbyshire.""""With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.""""I am talking of possibilities, Charles.""""Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to getPemberley by purchase than by imitation.""Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her verylittle attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drewnear the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and hiseldest sister, to observe the game.""Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?"" said Miss Bingley; ""willshe be as tall as I am?""""I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, orrather taller.""""How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted meso much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplishedfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.""""It is amazing to me,"" said Bingley, ""how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all are.""""All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?""""Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, andnet purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sureI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without beinginformed that she was very accomplished.""""Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,"" said Darcy, ""hastoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. Icannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of myacquaintance, that are really accomplished.""""Nor I, I am sure,"" said Miss Bingley.""Then,"" observed Elizabeth, ""you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished woman.""""Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.""""Oh! certainly,"" cried his faithful assistant, ""no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besidesall this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the wordwill be but half-deserved.""""All this she must possess,"" added Darcy, ""and to all this she mustyet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind byextensive reading.""""I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.""""Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthis?""""I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, andapplication, and elegance, as you describe united.""Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As allconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom.""Elizabeth Bennet,"" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,""is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to theother sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, itsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.""""Undoubtedly,"" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,""there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable.""Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, andthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent forimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settledthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennetwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sistersdeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better reliefto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everyattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister."
Pride & Prejudice,9,"Chapter 9Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have anote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form herown judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, andits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by hertwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have beenvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. Shewould not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carriedhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, thinkit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on MissBingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopesthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.""Indeed I have, sir,"" was her answer. ""She is a great deal too ill to bemoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespassa little longer on your kindness.""""Removed!"" cried Bingley. ""It must not be thought of. My sister, I amsure, will not hear of her removal.""""You may depend upon it, Madam,"" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,""that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while sheremains with us.""Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.""I am sure,"" she added, ""if it was not for such good friends I do notknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffersa vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which isalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetesttemper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they arenothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and acharming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in thecountry that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting itin a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.""""Whatever I do is done in a hurry,"" replied he; ""and therefore if Ishould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in fiveminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.""""That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,"" said Elizabeth.""You begin to comprehend me, do you?"" cried he, turning towards her.""Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.""""I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seenthrough I am afraid is pitiful.""""That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricatecharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.""""Lizzy,"" cried her mother, ""remember where you are, and do not run on inthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.""""I did not know before,"" continued Bingley immediately, ""that you were astudier of character. It must be an amusing study.""""Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have atleast that advantage.""""The country,"" said Darcy, ""can in general supply but a few subjects forsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying society.""""But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to beobserved in them for ever.""""Yes, indeed,"" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioninga country neighbourhood. ""I assure you there is quite as much of _that_going on in the country as in town.""Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him, continued her triumph.""I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, formy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast dealpleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?""""When I am in the country,"" he replied, ""I never wish to leave it;and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each theiradvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.""""Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But thatgentleman,"" looking at Darcy, ""seemed to think the country was nothingat all.""""Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,"" said Elizabeth, blushing for hermother. ""You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,which you must acknowledge to be true.""""Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meetingwith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.""Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep hiscountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towardsMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her ifCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.""Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man SirWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! Sogenteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves veryimportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.""""Did Charlotte dine with you?""""No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. Formy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is tojudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I thinkCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.""""She seems a very pleasant young woman.""""Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herselfhas often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boastof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybodybetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my ownpartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brotherGardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law wassure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, hedid not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verseson her, and very pretty they were.""""And so ended his affection,"" said Elizabeth impatiently. ""There hasbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!""""I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,"" said Darcy.""Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what isstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, Iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.""Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed tospeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness toJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to becivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her partindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that theyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexionand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had highanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which theattention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her owneasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was veryequal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, andabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the mostshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to thissudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:""I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and whenyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day ofthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.""Lydia declared herself satisfied. ""Oh! yes--it would be much better towait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carterwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,"" sheadded, ""I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell ColonelForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.""Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returnedinstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to theremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite ofall Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_."
Pride & Prejudice,10,"Chapter 10The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and MissBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, whocontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joinedtheir party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watchingthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention bymessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, andMrs. Hurst was observing their game.Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetualcommendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evennessof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and wasexactly in union with her opinion of each.""How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!""He made no answer.""You write uncommonly fast.""""You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.""""How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of ayear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!""""It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.""""Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.""""I have already told her so once, by your desire.""""I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mendpens remarkably well.""""Thank you--but I always mend my own.""""How can you contrive to write so even?""He was silent.""Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautifullittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to MissGrantley's.""""Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? Atpresent I have not room to do them justice.""""Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do youalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?""""They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for meto determine.""""It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter withease, cannot write ill.""""That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,"" cried herbrother, ""because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much forwords of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?""""My style of writing is very different from yours.""""Oh!"" cried Miss Bingley, ""Charles writes in the most careless wayimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.""""My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by whichmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.""""Your humility, Mr. Bingley,"" said Elizabeth, ""must disarm reproof.""""Nothing is more deceitful,"" said Darcy, ""than the appearance ofhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes anindirect boast.""""And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?""""The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects inwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity ofthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, youthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything withquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without anyattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfieldyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort ofpanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so verylaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?""""Nay,"" cried Bingley, ""this is too much, to remember at night all thefoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at thismoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needlessprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.""""I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced thatyou would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite asdependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you weremounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had betterstay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably notgo--and at another word, might stay a month.""""You have only proved by this,"" cried Elizabeth, ""that Mr. Bingley didnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now muchmore than he did himself.""""I am exceedingly gratified,"" said Bingley, ""by your converting what myfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I amafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no meansintend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such acircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as Icould.""""Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentionsas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?""""Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak forhimself.""""You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, tostand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, andthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offeringone argument in favour of its propriety.""""To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no meritwith you.""""To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding ofeither.""""You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence offriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often makeone readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reasonone into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you havesupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till thecircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?""""Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, toarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is toappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsistingbetween the parties?""""By all means,"" cried Bingley; ""let us hear all the particulars, notforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have moreweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assureyou, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison withmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do notknow a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and inparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,when he has nothing to do.""Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsense.""I see your design, Bingley,"" said his friend. ""You dislike an argument,and want to silence this.""""Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and MissBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be verythankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.""""What you ask,"" said Elizabeth, ""is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.Darcy had much better finish his letter.""Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabethfor an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrityto the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would leadthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, sheseated herself.Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-booksthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixedon her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at herbecause he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,however, at last that she drew his notice because there was somethingmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than inany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She likedhim too little to care for his approbation.After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm bya lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing nearElizabeth, said to her:""Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such anopportunity of dancing a reel?""She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with somesurprise at her silence.""Oh!"" said she, ""I heard you before, but I could not immediatelydetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I alwaysdelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person oftheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tellyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me ifyou dare.""""Indeed I do not dare.""Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at hisgallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcyhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He reallybelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, heshould be in some danger.Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking oftheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.""I hope,"" said she, as they were walking together in the shrubberythe next day, ""you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when thisdesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running afterofficers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour tocheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,which your lady possesses.""""Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?""""Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placedin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle thejudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in differentlines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, forwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?""""It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but theircolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might becopied.""At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst andElizabeth herself.""I did not know that you intended to walk,"" said Miss Bingley, in someconfusion, lest they had been overheard.""You used us abominably ill,"" answered Mrs. Hurst, ""running away withouttelling us that you were coming out.""Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walkby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,and immediately said:""This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into theavenue.""But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,laughingly answered:""No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appearto uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth. Good-bye.""She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope ofbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recoveredas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening."
Pride & Prejudice,11,"Chapter 11When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to hersister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into thedrawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with manyprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeableas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe anentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laughat their acquaintance with spirit.But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressedhimself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst alsomade her a slight bow, and said he was ""very glad;"" but diffusenessand warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy andattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest sheshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desireto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further fromthe door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyoneelse. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with greatdelight.When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of thecard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, andthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of thesofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her braceletsand rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with MissBennet.Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and shewas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. Shecould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered herquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, ""How pleasantit is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is noenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of abook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have notan excellent library.""No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, andcast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearingher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenlytowards him and said:""By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance atNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consultthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there arenot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than apleasure.""""If you mean Darcy,"" cried her brother, ""he may go to bed, if hechooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settledthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall sendround my cards.""""I should like balls infinitely better,"" she replied, ""if they werecarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferablytedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be muchmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order ofthe day.""""Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not benear so much like a ball.""Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walkedabout the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; butDarcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. Inthe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,turning to Elizabeth, said:""Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take aturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitude.""Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy lookedup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter asElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He wasdirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and downthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere. ""What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be hismeaning?""--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?""Not at all,"" was her answer; ""but depend upon it, he means to be severeon us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothingabout it.""Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy inanything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of histwo motives.""I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,"" said he, as soonas she allowed him to speak. ""You either choose this method of passingthe evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secretaffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figuresappear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would becompletely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much betteras I sit by the fire.""""Oh! shocking!"" cried Miss Bingley. ""I never heard anything soabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?""""Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,"" said Elizabeth. ""Wecan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimateas you are, you must know how it is to be done.""""But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy hasnot yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence ofmind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we willnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without asubject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.""""Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!"" cried Elizabeth. ""That is anuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it wouldbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love alaugh.""""Miss Bingley,"" said he, ""has given me more credit than can be.The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of theiractions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object inlife is a joke.""""Certainly,"" replied Elizabeth--""there are such people, but I hope Iam not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are preciselywhat you are without.""""Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the studyof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strongunderstanding to ridicule.""""Such as vanity and pride.""""Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a realsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.""Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.""Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,"" said Miss Bingley;""and pray what is the result?""""I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns ithimself without disguise.""""No,"" said Darcy, ""I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouchfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for theconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of othersso soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelingsare not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temperwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lostforever.""""_That_ is a failing indeed!"" cried Elizabeth. ""Implacable resentment_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. Ireally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.""""There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particularevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.""""And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.""""And yours,"" he replied with a smile, ""is willfully to misunderstandthem.""""Do let us have a little music,"" cried Miss Bingley, tired of aconversation in which she had no share. ""Louisa, you will not mind mywaking Mr. Hurst?""Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte wasopened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry forit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention."
Pride & Prejudice,12,"Chapter 12In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote thenext morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent forthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated onher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, whichwould exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receivethem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, atleast not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriagebefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingleyand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare themvery well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positivelyresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on thecontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and atlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfieldthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough wassaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to workon Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley wasthen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislikeof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go sosoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not besafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm whereshe felt herself to be right.To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been atNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and MissBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admirationshould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hopeof influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had beensuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weightin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoketen words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they wereat one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered mostconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almostall, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at lastvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give herto see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her mosttenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave ofthe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennetwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so muchtrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But theirfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was reallyglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. Theevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much ofits animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane andElizabeth.They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and humannature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations ofthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had informationfor them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been saidin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officershad dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and ithad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married."
Pride & Prejudice,13,"Chapter 13""I hope, my dear,"" said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were atbreakfast the next morning, ""that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.""""Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinnersare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.""""The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.""Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. ""A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to begot to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill thismoment.""""It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,"" said her husband; ""it is a person whom Inever saw in the whole course of my life.""This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of beingeagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:""About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight agoI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiringearly attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.""""Oh! my dear,"" cried his wife, ""I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thingin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your ownchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long agoto do something or other about it.""Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. Theyhad often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on whichMrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to railbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family offive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.""It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,"" said Mr. Bennet, ""andnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a littlesoftened by his manner of expressing himself.""""No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent ofhim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such falsefriends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father didbefore him?""""Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on thathead, as you will hear.""""Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.""Dear Sir,--""The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honouredfather always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had themisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; butfor some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it mightseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyonewith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for havingreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to bedistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine deBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence haspreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall bemy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards herladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies whichare instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, Ifeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace inall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds Iflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, andthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estatewill be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject theoffered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being themeans of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise forit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possibleamends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection toreceive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waitingon you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, andshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennightfollowing, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherineis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, providedthat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--Iremain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady anddaughters, your well-wisher and friend,""WILLIAM COLLINS""""At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,""said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. ""He seems to be a mostconscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not willprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be soindulgent as to let him come to us again.""""There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and ifhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person todiscourage him.""""Though it is difficult,"" said Jane, ""to guess in what way he can meanto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to hiscredit.""Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for LadyCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and buryinghis parishioners whenever it were required.""He must be an oddity, I think,"" said she. ""I cannot make himout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can hemean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose hewould help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?""""No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite thereverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in hisletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.""""In point of composition,"" said Mary, ""the letter does not seemdefective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet Ithink it is well expressed.""To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in anydegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin shouldcome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they hadreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As fortheir mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure whichastonished her husband and daughters.Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with greatpoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but theladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither inneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was atall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave andstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seatedbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family ofdaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in thisinstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he didnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. Thisgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.""You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it mayprove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled sooddly.""""You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.""""Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, youmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such thingsI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estateswill go when once they come to be entailed.""""I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, andcould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearingforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I comeprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,when we are better acquainted--""He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on eachother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. Thehall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet'sheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as hisown future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; andhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of itscooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, whoassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep agood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. Hebegged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declaredherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about aquarter of an hour."
Pride & Prejudice,14,"Chapter 14During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servantswere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. LadyCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration forhis comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosenbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated himto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspecthe protested that ""he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour ina person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himselfexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased toapprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour ofpreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool ofquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by manypeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; shemade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of theneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week ortwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him tomarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and hadonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectlyapproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafedto suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.""""That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""andI dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladiesin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?""""The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lanefrom Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.""""I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?""""She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of veryextensive property.""""Ah!"" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, ""then she is better off thanmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?""""She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself saysthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to thehandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marksthe young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sicklyconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in manyaccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I aminformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who stillresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescendsto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.""""Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies atcourt.""""Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived theBritish court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleasedwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion tooffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptableto ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, thather charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the mostelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned byher. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, andit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound topay.""""You judge very properly,"" said Mr. Bennet, ""and it is happy for youthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I askwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of themoment, or are the result of previous study?""""They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though Isometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegantcompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish togive them as unstudied an air as possible.""Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurdas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partnerin his pleasure.By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was gladto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readilyassented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everythingannounced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, andbegging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared athim, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after somedeliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened thevolume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read threepages, she interrupted him with:""Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning awayRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told meso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear moreabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.""Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:""I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by booksof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazesme, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous tothem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.""Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist atbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he actedvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia'sinterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he wouldresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore hisyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as anyaffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and preparedfor backgammon."
Pride & Prejudice,15,"Chapter 15Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature hadbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest partof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate andmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, hehad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any usefulacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up hadgiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now agood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living inretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpectedprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine deBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect whichhe felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as aclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture ofpride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended tomarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he hada wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he foundthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father'sestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility andsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his ownpart.His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely faceconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of whatwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settledchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in aquarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, aconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturallyto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it atLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and generalencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. ""As toher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she couldnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on herto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.""Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soondone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equallynext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon havetwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak ofthe day before was now high in her good graces.Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sisterexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followedhim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged withone of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Suchdoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had beenalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he toldElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of thehouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in theirwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walkerthan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of hiscousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention ofthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes wereimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, andnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin ina shop window, could recall them.But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whomthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walkingwith another officer on the other side of the way. The officer wasthe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia cameto inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with thestranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, underpretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunatelyhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, hadreached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreatedpermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned withhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted acommission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for theyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part ofbeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readinessof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct andunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking togethervery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcyand Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing theladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, andbegan the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, andMiss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way toLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroboratedit with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyeson Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of thestranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as theylooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy justdeigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible toimagine; it was impossible not to long to know.In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed whatpassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door ofMr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia'spressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite ofMrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding theinvitation.Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she waseagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, astheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothingabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in thestreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts toNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civilitywas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. Shereceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned withas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previousacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies whointroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such anexcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soonput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, thatMr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have alieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him thelast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued theoccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of theofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become ""stupid,disagreeable fellows."" Some of them were to dine with the Phillipsesthe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbournwould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillipsprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lotterytickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of suchdelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assuredwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen passbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended eitheror both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explainsuch behaviour than her sister.Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiringMrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except LadyCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but evenpointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, althoughutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might beattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with somuch attention in the whole course of his life."
Pride & Prejudice,16,"Chapter 16As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with theiraunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet fora single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coachconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; andthe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then inthe house.When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so muchstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared hemight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfastparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey muchgratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him whatRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to thedescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and foundthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt allthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparisonwith the housekeeper's room.In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, andthe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until thegentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentivelistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what sheheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours assoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examinetheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, theinterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinkingof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; butMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, andwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye wasturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seatedhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell intoconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feelthat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be renderedinteresting by the skill of the speaker.With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and theofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the youngladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kindlistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantlysupplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, hehad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.""I know little of the game at present,"" said he, ""but I shall be gladto improve myself, for in my situation in life--"" Mrs. Phillips was veryglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was hereceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first thereseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a mostdetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making betsand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was thereforeat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hearhim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to betold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared noteven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedlyrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how farNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked ina hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.""About a month,"" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subjectdrop, added, ""He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, Iunderstand.""""Yes,"" replied Mr. Wickham; ""his estate there is a noble one. A clearten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person morecapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, forI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from myinfancy.""Elizabeth could not but look surprised.""You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, afterseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meetingyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?""""As much as I ever wish to be,"" cried Elizabeth very warmly. ""I havespent four days in the same house with him, and I think him verydisagreeable.""""I have no right to give _my_ opinion,"" said Wickham, ""as to his beingagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known himtoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in generalastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so stronglyanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.""""Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house inthe neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked inHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not findhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.""""I cannot pretend to be sorry,"" said Wickham, after a shortinterruption, ""that he or that any man should not be estimated beyondtheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. Theworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by hishigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.""""I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be anill-tempered man."" Wickham only shook his head.""I wonder,"" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, ""whether he islikely to be in this country much longer.""""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when Iwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire willnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.""""Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason foravoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a senseof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what heis. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best menthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can neverbe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul bya thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has beenscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything andeverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing thememory of his father.""Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened withall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, theneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all thathe had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but veryintelligible gallantry.""It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,"" he added,""which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to bea most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted mefurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very greatattentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, andmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances havenow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--Iwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been inpossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman wewere speaking of just now.""""Indeed!""""Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the bestliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was givenelsewhere.""""Good heavens!"" cried Elizabeth; ""but how could _that_ be? How could hiswill be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?""""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as togive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted theintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merelyconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claimto it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certainit is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I wasof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and noless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really doneanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, andI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I canrecall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sortof men, and that he hates me.""""This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.""""Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till Ican forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.""Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer thanever as he expressed them.""But what,"" said she, after a pause, ""can have been his motive? What canhave induced him to behave so cruelly?""""A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot butattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked meless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommonattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He hadnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sortof preference which was often given me.""""I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never likedhim. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to bedespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him ofdescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity asthis.""After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, ""I _do_remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability ofhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His dispositionmust be dreadful.""""I will not trust myself on the subject,"" replied Wickham; ""I can hardlybe just to him.""Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, ""Totreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of hisfather!"" She could have added, ""A young man, too, like _you_, whose verycountenance may vouch for your being amiable""--but she contented herselfwith, ""and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!""""We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatestpart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be ofuse to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of thePemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a mostintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself tobe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him avoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it tobe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.""""How strange!"" cried Elizabeth. ""How abominable! I wonder that the verypride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no bettermotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--fordishonesty I must call it.""""It _is_ wonderful,"" replied Wickham, ""for almost all his actions maybe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It hasconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we arenone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were strongerimpulses even than pride.""""Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?""""Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his moneyfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve thepoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of whathis father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of thePemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind andcareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried upas the most attentive and best of brothers.""""What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?""He shook his head. ""I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain tospeak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, veryproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fondof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she isnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, herhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends hereducation.""After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could nothelp reverting once more to the first, and saying:""I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do youknow Mr. Bingley?""""Not at all.""""He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.Darcy is.""""Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does notwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worthhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he isa very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. Hispride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing somethingfor fortune and figure.""The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered roundthe other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousinElizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success weremade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost everypoint; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the leastimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and beggedthat she would not make herself uneasy.""I know very well, madam,"" said he, ""that when persons sit down to acard-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily Iam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. Thereare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to LadyCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regardinglittle matters.""Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins fora few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relationwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.""Lady Catherine de Bourgh,"" she replied, ""has very lately given hima living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to hernotice, but he certainly has not known her long.""""You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcywere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.""""No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine'sconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day beforeyesterday.""""Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it isbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.""This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor MissBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless heraffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were alreadyself-destined for another.""Mr. Collins,"" said she, ""speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and herdaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being hispatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.""""I believe her to be both in a great degree,"" replied Wickham; ""I havenot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never likedher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has thereputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believeshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part fromher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for hernephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have anunderstanding of the first class.""Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, andthey continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supperput an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noiseof Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him toeverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, donegracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She couldthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, allthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his nameas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydiatalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and thefish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. andMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his lossesat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearingthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well managebefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House."
Pride & Prejudice,17,"Chapter 17Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; sheknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question theveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. Thepossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough tointerest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to bedone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not beotherwise explained.""They have both,"" said she, ""been deceived, I dare say, in some wayor other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhapsmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us toconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,without actual blame on either side.""""Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say onbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in thebusiness? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill ofsomebody.""""Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of myopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful lightit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in sucha manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It isimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for hischaracter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be soexcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.""""I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, thanthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave melast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If itbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in hislooks.""""It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what tothink.""""I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.""But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affairbecame public.The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where thisconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they hadbeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personalinvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixedfor the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see theirdear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedlyasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. Tothe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennetas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all tothe others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with anactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as ifeager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to everyfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given incompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flatteredby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of aceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in thesociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; andElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's lookand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia dependedless on any single event, or any particular person, for though theyeach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ballwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that shehad no disinclination for it.""While I can have my mornings to myself,"" said she, ""it is enough--Ithink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of thosewho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable foreverybody.""Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she didnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help askinghim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and ifhe did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening'samusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained noscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebukeeither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing todance.""I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,"" said he, ""that a ballof this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancingmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my faircousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity ofsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the rightcause, and not to any disrespect for her.""Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed beingengaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collinsinstead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no helpfor it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforcedelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with asgood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with hisgallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now firststruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthyof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form aquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasingcivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at acompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished thangratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long beforeher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriagewas extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not chooseto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be theconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, andtill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, theyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at thistime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, therewas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Merytononce. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the veryshoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might havefound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended theimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less thana dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, andMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia."
Pride & Prejudice,18,"Chapter 18Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked invain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, adoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certaintyof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections thatmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more thanusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of allthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more thanmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arosethe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy'spleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and thoughthis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence waspronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and whotold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business theday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,""I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, ifhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.""This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught byElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable forWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, everyfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediatedisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility tothe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. Shewas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned awaywith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even inspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospectof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on herspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she hadnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transitionto the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particularnotice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without beingaware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeablepartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release fromhim was ecstasy.She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking ofWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those danceswere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation withher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who tookher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away againimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence ofmind; Charlotte tried to console her:""I dare say you will find him very agreeable.""""Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To finda man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such anevil.""When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim herhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be asimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasantin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made noanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to whichshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, andreading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholdingit. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began toimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and atfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it wouldbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she madesome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was againsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second timewith:--""It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talkedabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the sizeof the room, or the number of couples.""He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should besaid.""Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I mayobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But_now_ we may be silent.""""Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?""""Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to beentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have thetrouble of saying as little as possible.""""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do youimagine that you are gratifying mine?""""Both,"" replied Elizabeth archly; ""for I have always seen a greatsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to saysomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down toposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.""""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,""said he. ""How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.""""I must not decide on my own performance.""He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone downthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very oftenwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resistthe temptation, added, ""When you met us there the other day, we had justbeen forming a new acquaintance.""The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread hisfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herselffor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in aconstrained manner said, ""Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy mannersas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of_retaining_ them, is less certain.""""He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,"" replied Elizabethwith emphasis, ""and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from allhis life.""Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. Atthat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to passthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him onhis dancing and his partner.""I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such verysuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to thefirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does notdisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing ather sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will thenflow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. Youwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of thatyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.""The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but SirWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and hiseyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley andJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,he turned to his partner, and said, ""Sir William's interruption has mademe forget what we were talking of.""""I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not haveinterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what weare to talk of next I cannot imagine.""""What think you of books?"" said he, smiling.""Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the samefeelings.""""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least beno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.""""No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full ofsomething else.""""The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"" said he,with a look of doubt.""Yes, always,"" she replied, without knowing what she said, for herthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appearedby her suddenly exclaiming, ""I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created wasunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _beingcreated_.""""I am,"" said he, with a firm voice.""And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?""""I hope not.""""It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,to be secure of judging properly at first.""""May I ask to what these questions tend?""""Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,"" said she, endeavouringto shake off her gravity. ""I am trying to make it out.""""And what is your success?""She shook her head. ""I do not get on at all. I hear such differentaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.""""I can readily believe,"" answered he gravely, ""that reports may varygreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you werenot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason tofear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.""""But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have anotheropportunity.""""I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,"" he coldly replied.She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted insilence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towardsher, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger againstanother.They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, andwith an expression of civil disdain accosted her:""So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousandquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, amonghis other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the lateMr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not togive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy'susing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he hasalways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treatedMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, butI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that hecannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brotherthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation tothe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himselfout of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolentthing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,considering his descent, one could not expect much better.""""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,"" saidElizabeth angrily; ""for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worsethan of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I canassure you, he informed me himself.""""I beg your pardon,"" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.""Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.""""Insolent girl!"" said Elizabeth to herself. ""You are much mistakenif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I seenothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.Darcy."" She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to makeinquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile ofsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficientlymarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude forWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave waybefore the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.""I want to know,"" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than hersister's, ""what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you havebeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which caseyou may be sure of my pardon.""""No,"" replied Jane, ""I have not forgotten him; but I have nothingsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole ofhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which haveprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced thatMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he hasreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he hasbeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.""""Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?""""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.""""This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I amsatisfied. But what does he say of the living?""""He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heardthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left tohim _conditionally_ only.""""I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,"" said Elizabeth warmly;""but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; butsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learntthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think ofboth gentlemen as I did before.""She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and onwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened withdelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidencein it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrewto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her lastpartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate asto make a most important discovery.""I have found out,"" said he, ""by a singular accident, that there is nowin the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear thegentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours ofthe house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother LadyCatherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would havethought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine deBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is madein time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going todo, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My totalignorance of the connection must plead my apology.""""You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!""""Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power toassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.""Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring himthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introductionas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; thatit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on eitherside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior inconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to herwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when sheceased speaking, replied thus:""My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world inyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of yourunderstanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a widedifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe thatI consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity withthe highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility ofbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me tofollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me toperform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting toprofit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constantguide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted byeducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a younglady like yourself."" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whoseastonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefacedhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word ofit, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips thewords ""apology,"" ""Hunsford,"" and ""Lady Catherine de Bourgh."" It vexedher to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing himwith unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him timeto speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemedabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at theend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.Collins then returned to Elizabeth.""I have no reason, I assure you,"" said he, ""to be dissatisfied with myreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answeredme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of sayingthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to becertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a veryhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.""As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turnedher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and thetrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled inthat very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affectioncould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, ofendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughtsshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not toventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down tosupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness whichplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to findthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soonbe married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennetseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of thematch. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living butthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; andthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were ofJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much asshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her youngerdaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way ofother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to beable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, thatshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It wasnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because onsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. Sheconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equallyfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was nochance of it.In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother'swords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audiblewhisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that thechief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Hermother only scolded her for being nonsensical.""What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I amsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to saynothing _he_ may not like to hear.""""For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for youto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend byso doing!""Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother wouldtalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed andblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequentlyglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of whatshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she wasconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expressionof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed andsteady gravity.At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, whohad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw nolikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham andchicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval oftranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, andshe had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silententreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity ofexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth'seyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched herprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was veryill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanksof the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on tofavour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice wasweak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked atJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking toBingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signsof derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat hisinterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, ""That will doextremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the otheryoung ladies have time to exhibit.""Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; andElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraidher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.""If I,"" said Mr. Collins, ""were so fortunate as to be able to sing, Ishould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with anair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectlycompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our timeto music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. Therector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must makesuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and notoffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the timethat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the careand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from makingas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importancethat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquithim of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit anoccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with thefamily."" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which hadbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--manysmiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while hiswife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkablyclever, good kind of young man.To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement toexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it wouldhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit orfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sisterthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that hisfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which hemust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, shouldhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of thegentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased byMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and thoughhe could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of herpower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up withsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself toher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to herthe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owedher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, andgood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;though often standing within a very short distance of her, quitedisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be theprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced init.The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, bya manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter ofan hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see howheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and hersister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, andwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsedevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw alanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by thelong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and hissisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality andpoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy saidnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from therest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady asilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was toomuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of ""Lord,how tired I am!"" accompanied by a violent yawn.When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressinglycivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, andaddressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy hewould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, withoutthe ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting onher, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the nextday for a short time.Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under thedelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations ofsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedlysee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or fourmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thoughtwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though theman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of eachwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield."
Pride & Prejudice,19,"Chapter 19The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made hisdeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, ashis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and havingno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even atthe moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all theobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. Onfinding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:""May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in thecourse of this morning?""Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.Bennet answered instantly, ""Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzywill be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, Iwant you up stairs."" And, gathering her work together, she was hasteningaway, when Elizabeth called out:""Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuseme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I amgoing away myself.""""No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are."" And uponElizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about toescape, she added: ""Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.Collins.""Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment'sconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get itover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried toconceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided betweendistress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon asthey were gone, Mr. Collins began.""Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far fromdoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. Youwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this littleunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respectedmother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt thepurport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you todissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost assoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion ofmy future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on thissubject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons formarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the designof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.""The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run awaywith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she couldnot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,and he continued:""My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing forevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the exampleof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it willadd very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I oughtto have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice andrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of callingpatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unaskedtoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before Ileft Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson wasarranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, youmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choosea gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a smallincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon asyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by theway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the noticeand kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of theadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyondanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must beacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence andrespect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my generalintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my viewswere directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where Ican assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, thatbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honouredfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfymyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, thatthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholyevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may notbe for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, andI flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothingremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of theviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, andshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am wellaware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand poundsin the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother'sdecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself thatno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.""It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.""You are too hasty, sir,"" she cried. ""You forget that I have made noanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks forthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour ofyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than todecline them.""""I am not now to learn,"" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of thehand, ""that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of theman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for theirfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even athird time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have justsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.""""Upon my word, sir,"" cried Elizabeth, ""your hope is a ratherextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am notone of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are sodaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a secondtime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world whocould make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, Iam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for thesituation.""""Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,"" said Mr. Collinsvery gravely--""but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at alldisapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour ofseeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of yourmodesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.""""Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. Youmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the complimentof believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and byrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of yourfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbournestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter maybe considered, therefore, as finally settled."" And rising as shethus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thusaddressed her:""When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, Ishall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now givenme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because Iknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man onthe first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much toencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of thefemale character.""""Really, Mr. Collins,"" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, ""you puzzle meexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the formof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way asto convince you of its being one.""""You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that yourrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons forbelieving it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand isunworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer wouldbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connectionswith the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, arecircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into furtherconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by nomeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Yourportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undothe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I musttherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love bysuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.""""I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kindof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I wouldrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank youagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, butto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respectforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegantfemale, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speakingthe truth from her heart.""""You are uniformly charming!"" cried he, with an air of awkwardgallantry; ""and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the expressauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail ofbeing acceptable.""To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would makeno reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, ifhe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flatteringencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be utteredin such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least couldnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female."
Pride & Prejudice,20,"Chapter 20Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of hissuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibuleto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth openthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than sheentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself inwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collinsreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and thenproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the resultof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since therefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flowfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have beenglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encouragehim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,and could not help saying so.""But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,"" she added, ""that Lizzy shall bebrought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a veryheadstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will_make_ her know it.""""Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,"" cried Mr. Collins; ""but ifshe is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she wouldaltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, whonaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore sheactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better notto force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects oftemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.""""Sir, you quite misunderstand me,"" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. ""Lizzy isonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is asgood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, andwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.""She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to herhusband, called out as she entered the library, ""Oh! Mr. Bennet, youare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and makeLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if youdo not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.""Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed themon her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered byher communication.""I have not the pleasure of understanding you,"" said he, when she hadfinished her speech. ""Of what are you talking?""""Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.""""And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.""""Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon hermarrying him.""""Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.""Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to thelibrary.""Come here, child,"" cried her father as she appeared. ""I have sent foryou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has madeyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?"" Elizabeth replied that it was.""Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?""""I have, sir.""""Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon youraccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?""""Yes, or I will never see her again.""""An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you mustbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see youagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you againif you _do_.""Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded theaffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.""What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to_insist_ upon her marrying him.""""My dear,"" replied her husband, ""I have two small favours to request.First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on thepresent occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have thelibrary to myself as soon as may be.""Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, didMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Janein her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declinedinterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, andsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her mannervaried, however, her determination never did.Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousincould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no otherway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of herdeserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spendthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying toher, cried in a half whisper, ""I am glad you are come, for there is suchfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins hasmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.""Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered thebreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began onthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreatingher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all herfamily. ""Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,"" she added in a melancholy tone,""for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,nobody feels for my poor nerves.""Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.""Aye, there she comes,"" continued Mrs. Bennet, ""looking as unconcernedas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, providedshe can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take itinto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who isto maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keepyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I toldyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talkingto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talkingto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can haveno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But itis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.""Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible thatany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase theirritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any ofthem, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room withan air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said tothe girls, ""Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, holdyour tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversationtogether.""Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, butLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries afterherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a littlecuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretendingnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projectedconversation: ""Oh! Mr. Collins!""""My dear madam,"" replied he, ""let us be for ever silent on this point.Far be it from me,"" he presently continued, in a voice that marked hisdispleasure, ""to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignationto inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of ayoung man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubtof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect aswhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in ourestimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespectto your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions toyour daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet thecompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in mybehalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted mydismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are allliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with dueconsideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."""
Pride & Prejudice,21,"Chapter 21The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, andElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarilyattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of hermother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chieflyexpressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoketo her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible ofhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whosecivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, andespecially to her friend.The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or illhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabethhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan didnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone onSaturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickhamwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to theiraunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, waswell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledgedthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.""I found,"" said he, ""as the time drew near that I had better not meetMr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for somany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenesmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.""She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a fulldiscussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civillybestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back withthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended toher. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all thecompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as anoccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it camefrom Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; andElizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and sawher dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollectedherself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usualcheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxietyon the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and nosooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Janeinvited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,Jane, taking out the letter, said:""This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a gooddeal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are ontheir way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. Youshall hear what she says.""She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the informationof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had ahouse. The next was in these words: ""I do not pretend to regret anythingI shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of thatdelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile maylessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreservedcorrespondence. I depend on you for that."" To these highflownexpressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she sawnothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that theirabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and asto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease toregard it, in the enjoyment of his.""It is unlucky,"" said she, after a short pause, ""that you should not beable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we nothope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looksforward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightfulintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greatersatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London bythem.""""Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return intoHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:""""When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business whichtook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as weare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that whenCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we havedetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spendhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances arealready there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, mydearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but ofthat I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire mayabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that yourbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of thethree of whom we shall deprive you.""""It is evident by this,"" added Jane, ""that he comes back no more thiswinter.""""It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.""""Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his ownmaster. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage whichparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.""""Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not thinkGeorgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened intosomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain ofher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever beforementioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave thecountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem themunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will havefrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister'spartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles mostcapable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances tofavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearestJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happinessof so many?""""What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"" said Jane as shefinished it. ""Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare thatCaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she isperfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if shesuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) toput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?""""Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?""""Most willingly.""""You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother isin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows himto town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that hedoes not care about you.""Jane shook her head.""Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen youtogether can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. Sheis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But thecase is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and sheis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notionthat when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less troublein achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, andI dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingleytells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallestdegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you onTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, insteadof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.""""If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"" replied Jane, ""yourrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know thefoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceivinganyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceivingherself.""""That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since youwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.""""But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, inaccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marryelsewhere?""""You must decide for yourself,"" said Elizabeth; ""and if, upon maturedeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters ismore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you byall means to refuse him.""""How can you talk so?"" said Jane, faintly smiling. ""You must know thatthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I couldnot hesitate.""""I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consideryour situation with much compassion.""""But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never berequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!""The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmostcontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline'sinterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that thosewishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young manso totally independent of everyone.She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felton the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, thatBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of thefamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happento go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. Afterlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and theconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he hadbeen invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have twofull courses."
Pride & Prejudice,22,"Chapter 22The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during thechief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. ""It keeps him in goodhumour,"" said she, ""and I am more obliged to you than I can express.""Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, andthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This wasvery amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabethhad any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure herfrom any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towardsherself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were sofavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almostsecure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so verysoon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of hischaracter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the nextmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throwhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail toconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt knowntill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almostsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucasperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, andinstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little hadshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and asthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day thatwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation mustbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle withhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature mustguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for itscontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pureand disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon thatestablishment were gained.Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's presentcircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whomthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth wereexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with moreinterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longerMr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decidedopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of theLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wifeshould make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopesof _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise havedone; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte'sdying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She hadgained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections werein general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensiblenor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her mustbe imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highlyeither of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it wasthe only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantestpreservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and atthe age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt allthe good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the businesswas the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendshipshe valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to beshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolvedto give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what hadpassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course verydutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for thecuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very directquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he wasat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing topublish his prosperous love.As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of thefamily, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies movedfor the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, wheneverhis engagements might allow him to visit them.""My dear madam,"" he replied, ""this invitation is particularlygratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; andyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon aspossible.""They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish forso speedy a return, immediately said:""But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, mygood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk ofoffending your patroness.""""My dear sir,"" replied Mr. Collins, ""I am particularly obliged to youfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking somaterial a step without her ladyship's concurrence.""""You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than herdispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to usagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.""""Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by suchaffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receivefrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of yourregard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, thoughmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall nowtake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting mycousin Elizabeth.""With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equallysurprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished tounderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of heryounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there wasa solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by nomeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to readand improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a veryagreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of thiskind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in aprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with herfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; butthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far frompossibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment wasconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, andshe could not help crying out:""Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!""The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling herstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct areproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regainedher composure, and calmly replied:""Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incrediblethat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?""But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effortfor it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect oftheir relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished herall imaginable happiness.""I see what you are feeling,"" replied Charlotte. ""You must be surprised,very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marryyou. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will besatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I neverwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins'scharacter, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that mychance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast onentering the marriage state.""Elizabeth quietly answered ""Undoubtedly;"" and after an awkward pause,they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay muchlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of sounsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offersof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being nowaccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony wasnot exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possiblethat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every betterfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was amost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herselfand sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that itwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she hadchosen."
Pride & Prejudice,23,"Chapter 23Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on whatshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mentionit, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, toannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between thehouses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, butincredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded andoften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:""Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you knowthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?""Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have bornewithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carriedhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to thetruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with themost forbearing courtesy.Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasanta situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, bymentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; andendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sistersby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which shewas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on thehappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent characterof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal whileSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelingsfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelievingthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collinshad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never behappy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Twoinferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, thatElizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that sheherself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these twopoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing couldconsole and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out herresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth withoutscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir Williamor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before shecould at all forgive their daughter.Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and suchas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; forit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he hadbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, andmore foolish than his daughter!Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she saidless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kittyand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only aclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of newsto spread at Meryton.Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retorton Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and shecalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have beenenough to drive happiness away.Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept themmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded thatno real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Herdisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to hersister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion couldnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of hisreturn.Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was countingthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promisedletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed totheir father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which atwelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharginghis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with manyrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affectionof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it wasmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so readyto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whitherhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to takeplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerableargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making himthe happiest of men.Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter ofpleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed tocomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should cometo Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenientand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the housewhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people themost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, andthey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continuedabsence.Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day afterday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than thereport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more toNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalousfalsehood.Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but thathis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling asshe was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and sodishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent itsfrequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sistersand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of MissDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, forthe strength of his attachment.As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, morepainful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous ofconcealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subjectwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express herimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if hedid not come back she would think herself very ill used. It neededall Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerabletranquillity.Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but hisreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on hisfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved themfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent byhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in timeto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention ofanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sightof Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, sheregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to seethem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; andwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced thatthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herselfand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. Shecomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.""Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"" said she, ""it is very hard to think that CharlotteLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced tomake way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!""""My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope forbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.""This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead ofmaking any answer, she went on as before.""I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it wasnot for the entail, I should not mind it.""""What should not you mind?""""I should not mind anything at all.""""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of suchinsensibility.""""I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. Howanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's owndaughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?""""I leave it to yourself to determine,"" said Mr. Bennet."
Pride & Prejudice,24,"Chapter 24Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very firstsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London forthe winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having hadtime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he leftthe country.Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the restof the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of thewriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupiedthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Carolineboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predictthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her formerletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being aninmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans ofthe latter with regard to new furniture.Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concernfor her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline'sassertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid nocredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than shehad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, shecould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easinessof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slaveof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happinessto the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it inwhatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, asshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. Shecould think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had reallydied away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whetherhe had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped hisobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must bematerially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remainedthe same, her peace equally wounded.A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings toElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after alonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she couldnot help saying:""Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have noidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. ButI will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shallall be as we were before.""Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but saidnothing.""You doubt me,"" cried Jane, slightly colouring; ""indeed, you haveno reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of myacquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. Alittle time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.""With a stronger voice she soon added, ""I have this comfort immediately,that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that ithas done no harm to anyone but myself.""""My dear Jane!"" exclaimed Elizabeth, ""you are too good. Your sweetnessand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to sayto you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as youdeserve.""Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw backthe praise on her sister's warm affection.""Nay,"" said Elizabeth, ""this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all theworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only wantto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do notbe afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on yourprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few peoplewhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I seeof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirmsmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of thelittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit orsense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; theother is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it isunaccountable!""""My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They willruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for differenceof situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, andCharlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of alarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and beready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something likeregard and esteem for our cousin.""""To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one elsecould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded thatCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of herunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is aconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well asI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married himcannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, thoughit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuadeyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility ofdanger security for happiness.""""I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"" repliedJane; ""and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happytogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. Youmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreatyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, andsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancyourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young manto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing butour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more thanit does.""""And men take care that they should.""""If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no ideaof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.""""I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,""said Elizabeth; ""but without scheming to do wrong, or to make othersunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,will do the business.""""And do you impute it to either of those?""""Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying whatI think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.""""You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?""""Yes, in conjunction with his friend.""""I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They canonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman cansecure it.""""Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides hishappiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; theymay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, greatconnections, and pride.""""Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,"" replied Jane;""but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They haveknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they loveher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikelythey should have opposed their brother's. What sister would thinkherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something veryobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not tryto part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such anaffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me mostunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having beenmistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of whatI should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it inthe best light, in the light in which it may be understood.""Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley'sname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning nomore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not accountfor it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it withless perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what shedid not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely theeffect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw herno more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted atthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's bestcomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. ""So, Lizzy,"" said he one day,""your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next tobeing married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinctionamong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear tobe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough inMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickhambe _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.""""Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must notall expect Jane's good fortune.""""True,"" said Mr. Bennet, ""but it is a comfort to think that whatever ofthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will makethe most of it.""Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloomwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbournfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was nowadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had alreadyheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody waspleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before theyhad known anything of the matter.Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might beany extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the societyof Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded forallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody elseMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men."
Pride & Prejudice,25,"Chapter 25After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival ofSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on hisside, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reasonto hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day wouldbe fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of hisrelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his faircousins health and happiness again, and promised their father anotherletter of thanks.On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receivingher brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmasat Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatlysuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfieldladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who livedby trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been sowell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years youngerthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegantwoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between thetwo eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.They had frequently been staying with her in town.The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was todistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this wasdone she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. Theyhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of hergirls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there wasnothing in it.""I do not blame Jane,"" she continued, ""for Jane would have got Mr.Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to thinkthat she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it notbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will havea daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is justas much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it ofthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwartedso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselvesbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is thegreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, oflong sleeves.""Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made hersister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned theconversation.When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. ""Itseems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,"" said she. ""I amsorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, suchas you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girlfor a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgetsher, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.""""An excellent consolation in its way,"" said Elizabeth, ""but it will notdo for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not oftenhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man ofindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently inlove with only a few days before.""""But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, sodoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is asoften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley'slove?""""I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quiteinattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every timethey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball heoffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and Ispoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there befiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?""""Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. PoorJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not getover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; youwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think shewould be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might beof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful asanything.""Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuadedof her sister's ready acquiescence.""I hope,"" added Mrs. Gardiner, ""that no consideration with regard tothis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part oftown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we goout so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,unless he really comes to see her.""""And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of hisfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in sucha part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy mayperhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but hewould hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from itsimpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingleynever stirs without him.""""So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Janecorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.""""She will drop the acquaintance entirely.""But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place thispoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's beingwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject whichconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirelyhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, thathis affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friendssuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane'sattractions.Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and theBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as shehoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger ofseeing him.The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without itsengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainmentof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a familydinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers alwaysmade part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; andon these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth'swarm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preferenceof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; andshe resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she leftHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging suchan attachment.To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that verypart of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, manyacquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there sincethe death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresherintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way ofprocuring.Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy bycharacter perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subjectof discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minutedescription which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute ofpraise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting bothhim and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy'streatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman'sreputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, andwas confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. FitzwilliamDarcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy."
Pride & Prejudice,26,"Chapter 26Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly givenon the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; afterhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:""You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely becauseyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speakingopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involveyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the wantof fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune heought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, youmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we allexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution andgood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.""""My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.""""Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.""""Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care ofmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if Ican prevent it.""""Elizabeth, you are not serious now.""""I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love withMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached tome--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudenceof it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me doesme the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. Myfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, Ishould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; butsince we see every day that where there is affection, young peopleare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering intoengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so manyof my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that itwould be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is notto be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his firstobject. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,I will do my best.""""Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so veryoften. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.""""As I did the other day,"" said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: ""verytrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imaginethat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has beenso frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to thenecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon myhonour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hopeyou are satisfied.""Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her forthe kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advicebeing given on such a point, without being resented.Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quittedby the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage wasnow fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to thinkit inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, thatshe ""_wished_ they might be happy."" Thursday was to be the wedding day,and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when sherose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious andreluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied herout of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:""I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.""""_That_ you certainly shall.""""And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?""""We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.""""I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, tocome to Hunsford.""Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in thevisit.""My father and Maria are coming to me in March,"" added Charlotte, ""and Ihope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be aswelcome as either of them.""The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent fromthe church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, onthe subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and theircorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; thatit should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could neveraddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for thesake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letterswere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but becuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she wouldlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself tobe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotteexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. Shewrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothingwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, androads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was mostfriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford andRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must waitfor her own visit there to know the rest.Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce theirsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped itwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatiencegenerally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing orhearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing thather last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident beenlost.""My aunt,"" she continued, ""is going to-morrow into that part of thetown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.""She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.""I did not think Caroline in spirits,"" were her words, ""but she was veryglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my comingto London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reachedher. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so muchengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found thatMiss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit wasnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shallsee them soon here.""Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her thataccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured topersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer beblind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morningfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, thevisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself nolonger. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister willprove what she felt.""My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in herbetter judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have beenentirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if Istill assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence wasas natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason forwishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were tohappen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did notreturn my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did Ireceive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident thatshe had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for notcalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and wasin every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I wasperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me outas she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began onher side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been actingwrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is thecause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ knowthis anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easilyaccount for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is tohis sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural andamiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she saidherself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if shewanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. Icannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I shouldbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicityin all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and theinvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you verysoon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfieldagain, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had betternot mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accountsfrom our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William andMaria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.""This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as sheconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would noteven wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk onevery review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possibleadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantlyregret what he had thrown away.Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promiseconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabethhad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than toherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough tosee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfiedwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortunepermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the mostremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himselfagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case thanin Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able tosuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she wasready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could verysincerely wish him happy.All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating thecircumstances, she thus went on: ""I am now convinced, my dear aunt, thatI have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pureand elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, andwish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordialtowards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot findout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling tothink her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. Mywatchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a moreinteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in lovewith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia takehis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in theways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction thathandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain."""
Pride & Prejudice,27,"Chapter 27With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwisediversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty andsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to takeElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously ofgoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the planand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasureas well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeingCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. Therewas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and suchuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little changewas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give hera peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would havebeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She wasto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvementof spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan becameperfect as plan could be.The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that hetold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; onhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget thatElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, thefirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his mannerof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her ofwhat she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting theiropinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, therewas a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her tohim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiableand pleasing.Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make herthink him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, agood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to saythat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as muchdelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, butshe had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new ofthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities wereworn out, like his information.It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so earlyas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner'sdoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; whenthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful andlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them towait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seenher for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy andkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle andshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was hersister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply toher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support herspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her theparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, andrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane andherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up theacquaintance.Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, andcomplimented her on bearing it so well.""But my dear Elizabeth,"" she added, ""what sort of girl is Miss King? Ishould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.""""Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to geta girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he ismercenary.""""If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall knowwhat to think.""""She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.""""But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's deathmade her mistress of this fortune.""""No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be formaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equallypoor?""""But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards herso soon after this event.""""A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegantdecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,why should _we_?""""_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her beingdeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.""""Well,"" cried Elizabeth, ""have it as you choose. _He_ shall bemercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.""""No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.""""Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live inDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are notmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrowwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who hasneither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only onesworth knowing, after all.""""Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.""Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had theunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt ina tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.""We have not determined how far it shall carry us,"" said Mrs. Gardiner,""but, perhaps, to the Lakes.""No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and heracceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. ""Oh, my dear,dear aunt,"" she rapturously cried, ""what delight! what felicity! Yougive me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. Whatare young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transportwe shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like othertravellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in ourimaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality oftravellers."""
Pride & Prejudice,28,"Chapter 28Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting toElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she hadseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was insearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabethsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to theroad, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotteappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate whichled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles ofthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicingat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with theliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied withcoming when she found herself so affectionately received. She sawinstantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her someminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all herfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out theneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as theywere in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatiousformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife'soffers of refreshment.Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not helpin fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, itsaspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. Butthough everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able togratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder ather friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably beashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned hereye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; butin general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough toadmire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard tothe fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that hadhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in thegarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation ofwhich he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his mostrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenancewith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, andowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the waythrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them aninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed outwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number thefields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were inthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or whichthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with theprospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that borderedthe park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsomemodern building, well situated on rising ground.From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a whitefrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlottetook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband'shelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everythingwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of whichElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could beforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and byCharlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be oftenforgotten.She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. Itwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joiningin, observed:""Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherinede Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you willbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and Idoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her noticewhen service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying shewill include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which shehonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte ischarming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowedto walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.""""Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"" addedCharlotte, ""and a most attentive neighbour.""""Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort ofwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.""The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate uponCharlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that itwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visitwould pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatiousinterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse withRosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting readyfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house inconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody runningup stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She openedthe door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless withagitation, cried out--""Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, forthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Makehaste, and come down this moment.""Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, inquest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at thegarden gate.""And is this all?"" cried Elizabeth. ""I expected at least that the pigswere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and herdaughter.""""La! my dear,"" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, ""it is notLady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a littlecreature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?""""She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.Why does she not come in?""""Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favourswhen Miss de Bourgh comes in.""""I like her appearance,"" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. ""Shelooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She willmake him a very proper wife.""Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversationwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, wasstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatnessbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked thatway.At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, andthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the twogirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, whichCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was askedto dine at Rosings the next day."
Pride & Prejudice,29,"Chapter 29Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wonderingvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and hiswife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunityof doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of LadyCatherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.""I confess,"" said he, ""that I should not have been at all surprised byher ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening atRosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that itwould happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Whocould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediatelyafter your arrival!""""I am the less surprised at what has happened,"" replied Sir William,""from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, whichmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, suchinstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.""Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but theirvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in whatthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, andso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--""Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. LadyCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us whichbecomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put onwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasionfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of youfor being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rankpreserved.""While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their differentdoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very muchobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts ofher ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucaswho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to herintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had doneto his presentation at St. James's.As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half amile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; andElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in suchraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was butslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of thehouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originallycost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was everymoment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of LadyCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents ormiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thoughtshe could witness without trepidation.From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with arapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, theyfollowed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where LadyCatherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins hadsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction shouldbe hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of thoseapologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completelyawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courageenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edgeof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herselfquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before hercomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-markedfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was notconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make hervisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable bysilence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately toElizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, shebelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportmentshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on thedaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at herbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face anylikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; herfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke verylittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearancethere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listeningto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction beforeher eyes.After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows toadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worthlooking at in the summer.The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants andall the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he hadlikewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by herladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnishnothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delightedalacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by SirWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-lawsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, andgave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proveda novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabethwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seatedbetween Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged inlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her alldinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how littleMiss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearingshe was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and thegentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little tobe done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without anyintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on everysubject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used tohave her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domesticconcerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice asto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to beregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to thecare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing wasbeneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with anoccasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discoursewith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria andElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knewthe least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sistersshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any ofthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where theyhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had beenher mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence ofher questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine thenobserved,""Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For yoursake,"" turning to Charlotte, ""I am glad of it; but otherwise I see nooccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thoughtnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, MissBennet?""""A little.""""Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Ourinstrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try itsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?""""One of them does.""""Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The MissWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Doyou draw?""""No, not at all.""""What, none of you?""""Not one.""""That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mothershould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.""""My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.""""Has your governess left you?""""We never had any governess.""""No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at homewithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother musthave been quite a slave to your education.""Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not beenthe case.""Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, youmust have been neglected.""""Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us aswished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged toread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to beidle, certainly might.""""Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I hadknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engageone. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steadyand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It iswonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in thatway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four niecesof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; andit was but the other day that I recommended another young person,who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quitedelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf'scalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'LadyCatherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of youryounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?""""Yes, ma'am, all.""""All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. Theyounger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sistersmust be very young?""""Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to bemuch in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard uponyounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society andamusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination tomarry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youthas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it wouldnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.""""Upon my word,"" said her ladyship, ""you give your opinion very decidedlyfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?""""With three younger sisters grown up,"" replied Elizabeth, smiling, ""yourladyship can hardly expect me to own it.""Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had everdared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.""You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need notconceal your age.""""I am not one-and-twenty.""When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tableswere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins satdown to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, thetwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up herparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable wasuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinsonexpressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, orhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at theother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakesof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collinswas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking herfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotesand noble names.When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gatheredround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they wereto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned bythe arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soonas they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousinto give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, forCharlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But hercommendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfyMr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praiseinto his own hands."
Pride & Prejudice,30,"Chapter 30Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was longenough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were notoften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted hismorning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; butwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of hercousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfastand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or inreading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not preferthe dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had amore pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellentreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have beenmuch less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; andshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, andwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages wentalong, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happenedalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, andhad a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely everprevailed upon to get out.Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, andnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livingsto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so manyhours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room duringthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangementof the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if sheaccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of findingout that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not incommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistratein her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to herby Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed tobe quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into thevillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scoldthem into harmony and plenty.The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only onecard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpartof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of livingin the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her timecomfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation withCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she hadoften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where shefrequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, wasalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there wasa nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, andwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring anaddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must beimportant. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy wasexpected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were notmany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming wouldfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, andshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on himwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidentlydestined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatestsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, andseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen byMiss Lucas and herself.His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walkingthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making hisbow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the greatintelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay hisrespects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, forMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son ofhis uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, whenMr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seenthem from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately runninginto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:""I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy wouldnever have come so soon to wait upon me.""Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortlyafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person andaddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had beenused to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usualreserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward herfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merelycurtseyed to him without saying a word.Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with thereadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; buthis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house andgarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire ofElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usualway, and after a moment's pause, added:""My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you neverhappened to see her there?""She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to seewhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed betweenthe Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as heanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. Thesubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards wentaway."
Pride & Prejudice,31,"Chapter 31Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasuresof their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before theyreceived any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in thehouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured bysuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church tocome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very littleof Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at theParsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seenonly at church.The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joinedthe party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship receivedthem civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means soacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,much more than to any other person in the room.Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was awelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend hadmoreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, andtalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and stayingat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half sowell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so muchspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turnedtowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after awhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did notscruple to call out:""What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talkingof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.""""We are speaking of music, madam,"" said he, when no longer able to avoida reply.""Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. Imust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoymentof music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her healthhad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performeddelightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?""Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.""I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,"" said LadyCatherine; ""and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excelif she does not practice a good deal.""""I assure you, madam,"" he replied, ""that she does not need such advice.She practises very constantly.""""So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next writeto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I oftentell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired withoutconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that shewill never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often toldher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that partof the house.""Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and madeno answer.When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of havingpromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. Hedrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and thentalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked awayfrom her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianofortestationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer'scountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the firstconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:""You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hearme? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. Thereis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at thewill of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidateme.""""I shall not say you are mistaken,"" he replied, ""because you could notreally believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I havehad the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you findgreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact arenot your own.""Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said toColonel Fitzwilliam, ""Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion ofme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unluckyin meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a partof the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree ofcredit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention allthat you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave tosay, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and suchthings may come out as will shock your relations to hear.""""I am not afraid of you,"" said he, smilingly.""Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,"" cried ColonelFitzwilliam. ""I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.""""You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He dancedonly four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certainknowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of apartner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.""""I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assemblybeyond my own party.""""True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, ColonelFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.""""Perhaps,"" said Darcy, ""I should have judged better, had I sought anintroduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.""""Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"" said Elizabeth, stilladdressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. ""Shall we ask him why a man of sense andeducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommendhimself to strangers?""""I can answer your question,"" said Fitzwilliam, ""without applying tohim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.""""I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"" said Darcy,""of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannotcatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in theirconcerns, as I often see done.""""My fingers,"" said Elizabeth, ""do not move over this instrument in themasterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the sameforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then Ihave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take thetrouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers ascapable as any other woman's of superior execution.""Darcy smiled and said, ""You are perfectly right. You have employed yourtime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you canthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.""Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to knowwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, saidto Darcy:""Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, andcould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notionof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would havebeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.""Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to hiscousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could shediscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Missde Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might havebeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixingwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth receivedthem with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of thegentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage wasready to take them all home."
Pride & Prejudice,32,"Chapter 32Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Janewhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of avisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely tobe Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away herhalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, andMr. Darcy only, entered the room.He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for hisintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies wereto be within.They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutelynecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergencerecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, andfeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hastydeparture, she observed:""How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see youall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the daybefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?""""Perfectly so, I thank you.""She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a shortpause added:""I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of everreturning to Netherfield again?""""I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spendvery little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, andis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continuallyincreasing.""""If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better forthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then wemight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley didnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood asfor his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the sameprinciple.""""I should not be surprised,"" said Darcy, ""if he were to give it up assoon as any eligible purchase offers.""Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of hisfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave thetrouble of finding a subject to him.He took the hint, and soon began with, ""This seems a very comfortablehouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.Collins first came to Hunsford.""""I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed herkindness on a more grateful object.""""Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.""""Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with oneof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have madehim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--thoughI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as thewisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in aprudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.""""It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy adistance of her own family and friends.""""An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.""""And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day'sjourney. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.""""I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_of the match,"" cried Elizabeth. ""I should never have said Mrs. Collinswas settled _near_ her family.""""It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyondthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.""As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied sheunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane andNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered:""I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near herfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on manyvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses oftravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not thecase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but notsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded myfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_the present distance.""Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, ""_You_ cannothave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot havebeen always at Longbourn.""Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change offeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, andglancing over it, said, in a colder voice:""Are you pleased with Kent?""A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either sidecalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotteand her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprisedthem. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intrudingon Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without sayingmuch to anybody, went away.""What can be the meaning of this?"" said Charlotte, as soon as he wasgone. ""My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would neverhave called us in this familiar way.""But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after variousconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed fromthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probablefrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors therewas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannotalways be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or thepleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, thetwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thitheralmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimesseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by theiraunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because hehad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommendedhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction inbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of herformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she sawthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,she believed he might have the best informed mind.But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficultto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat thereten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrificeto propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared reallyanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. ColonelFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he wasgenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have toldher; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effectof love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herselfseriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were atRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. Hecertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of thatlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she oftendoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes itseemed nothing but absence of mind.She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of hisbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger ofraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in heropinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike wouldvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marryingColonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; hecertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronagein the church, and his cousin could have none at all."
Pride & Prejudice,33,"Chapter 33More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of themischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, toprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first thatit was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed likewilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it wasnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. Henever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talkingor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their thirdrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--abouther pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and heropinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking ofRosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed toexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have ColonelFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he mustmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressedher a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in thepales opposite the Parsonage.She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written inspirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she sawon looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away theletter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:""I did not know before that you ever walked this way.""""I have been making the tour of the park,"" he replied, ""as I generallydo every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Areyou going much farther?""""No, I should have turned in a moment.""And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonagetogether.""Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?"" said she.""Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. Hearranges the business just as he pleases.""""And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at leastpleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seemsmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.""""He likes to have his own way very well,"" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.""But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having itthan many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speakfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial anddependence.""""In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little ofeither. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial anddependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from goingwherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?""""These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I haveexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greaterweight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry wherethey like.""""Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very oftendo.""""Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not manyin my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention tomoney.""""Is this,"" thought Elizabeth, ""meant for me?"" and she coloured at theidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, ""And pray, whatis the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother isvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.""He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupta silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,she soon afterwards said:""I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake ofhaving someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure alasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as wellfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what helikes with her.""""No,"" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, ""that is an advantage which he mustdivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.""""Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does yourcharge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes alittle difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, shemay like to have her own way.""As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the mannerin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely togive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or othergot pretty near the truth. She directly replied:""You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I daresay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is avery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst andMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.""""I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--heis a great friend of Darcy's.""""Oh! yes,"" said Elizabeth drily; ""Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.""""Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him inthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me inour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted tohim. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose thatBingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.""""What is it you mean?""""It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be anunpleasant thing.""""You may depend upon my not mentioning it.""""And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to beBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himselfon having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a mostimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any otherparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believinghim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and fromknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.""""Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?""""I understood that there were some very strong objections against thelady.""""And what arts did he use to separate them?""""He did not talk to me of his own arts,"" said Fitzwilliam, smiling. ""Heonly told me what I have now told you.""Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling withindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why shewas so thoughtful.""I am thinking of what you have been telling me,"" said she. ""Yourcousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?""""You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?""""I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of hisfriend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was todetermine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.But,"" she continued, recollecting herself, ""as we know none of theparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposedthat there was much affection in the case.""""That is not an unnatural surmise,"" said Fitzwilliam, ""but it is alessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.""This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a pictureof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, andtherefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferentmatters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruptionof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any otherpeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. Therecould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could havesuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measurestaken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she hadalways attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangementof them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ wasthe cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane hadsuffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a whileevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in theworld; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.""There were some very strong objections against the lady,"" were ColonelFitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, herhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was inbusiness in London.""To Jane herself,"" she exclaimed, ""there could be no possibility ofobjection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understandingexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neithercould anything be urged against my father, who, though with somepeculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, andrespectability which he will probably never reach."" When she thought ofher mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allowthat any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whosepride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want ofimportance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governedby this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.Bingley for his sister.The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on aheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added toher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend hercousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as muchas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collinscould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being ratherdispleased by her staying at home."
Pride & Prejudice,34,"Chapter 34When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herselfas much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment theexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since herbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there anyrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of thatcheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindlydisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabethnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with anattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy'sshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave hera keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolationto think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after thenext--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she shouldherself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery ofher spirits, by all that affection could do.She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering thathis cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clearthat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did notmean to be unhappy about him.While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of thedoor-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of itsbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late inthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differentlyaffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into theroom. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after herhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, andthen getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, butsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards herin an agitated manner, and thus began:""In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not berepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and loveyou.""Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besidesthose of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on thesubject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--ofits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had alwaysopposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due tothe consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend hissuit.In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible tothe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions didnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was toreceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, shelost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself toanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded withrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spiteof all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and withexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance ofhis hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubtof a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, buthis countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance couldonly exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into hercheeks, and she said:""In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode toexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, howeverunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation shouldbe felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But Icannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainlybestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain toanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will beof short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long preventedthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty inovercoming it after this explanation.""Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixedon her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment thansurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbanceof his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for theappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believedhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelingsdreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:""And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ atcivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.""""I might as well inquire,"" replied she, ""why with so evident a desireof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked meagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I haveother provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided againstyou--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do youthink that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who hasbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a mostbeloved sister?""As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotionwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while shecontinued:""I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive canexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only meansof dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of theworld for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision fordisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutestkind.""She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listeningwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.""Can you deny that you have done it?"" she repeated.With assumed tranquillity he then replied: ""I have no wish of denyingthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from yoursister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have beenkinder than towards myself.""Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.""But it is not merely this affair,"" she continued, ""on which my dislikeis founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you wasdecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I receivedmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have tosay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?""""You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,"" said Darcy,in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.""Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling aninterest in him?""""His misfortunes!"" repeated Darcy contemptuously; ""yes, his misfortuneshave been great indeed.""""And of your infliction,"" cried Elizabeth with energy. ""You have reducedhim to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You havewithheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed forhim. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independencewhich was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt andridicule.""""And this,"" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,""is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to thiscalculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,"" added he, stopping inhis walk, and turning towards her, ""these offenses might have beenoverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of thescruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. Thesebitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greaterpolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief ofmy being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, byreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural andjust. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of yourconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whosecondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?""Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried tothe utmost to speak with composure when she said:""You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of yourdeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concernwhich I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a moregentlemanlike manner.""She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:""You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way thatwould have tempted me to accept it.""Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with anexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:""From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--ofmy acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullestbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain ofthe feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork ofdisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable adislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were thelast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.""""You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend yourfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my bestwishes for your health and happiness.""And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard himthe next moment open the front door and quit the house.The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not howto support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried forhalf-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer ofmarriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her forso many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite ofall the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marryingher sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in hisown case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspiredunconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominablepride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect toJane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he couldnot justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soonovercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had fora moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till thesound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was toencounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room."
Pride & Prejudice,35,"Chapter 35Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditationswhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from thesurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anythingelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon afterbreakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceedingdirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy'ssometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. Thepark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed oneof the gates into the ground.After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she wastempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates andlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent hadmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to theverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove whichedged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was nownear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronouncedher name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, thoughin a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards thegate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,""I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"" And then, with aslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, writtenquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewisefull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was datedfrom Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--""Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehensionof its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of thoseoffers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without anyintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wisheswhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and theeffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,should have been spared, had not my character required it to be writtenand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demandyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but Idemand it of your justice.""Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equalmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingleyfrom your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of variousclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediateprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully andwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledgedfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any otherdependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expectits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two youngpersons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, couldbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was lastnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hopeto be in the future secured, when the following account of my actionsand their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, whichis due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings whichmay be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessitymust be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.""I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common withothers, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other youngwoman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the danceat Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a seriousattachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while Ihad the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by SirWilliam Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions toyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone couldbe undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviourattentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for MissBennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I alsowatched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convincedfrom the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentionswith pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation ofsentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have beenin error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latterprobable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflictpain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall notscruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance andair was such as might have given the most acute observer a convictionthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to beeasily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent iscertain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisionsare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believeher to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartialconviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to themarriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to havethe utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want ofconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. Butthere were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though stillexisting, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I hadmyself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately beforeme. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of yourmother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to thattotal want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed byherself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by yourfather. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concernfor the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at thisrepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, tohave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, thanit is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only sayfarther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all partieswas confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have ledme before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappyconnection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, asyou, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.""The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasinesshad been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling wassoon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost indetaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly inLondon. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the officeof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. Idescribed, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrancemight have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not supposethat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not beenseconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of yoursister's indifference. He had before believed her to return hisaffection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has greatnatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on hisown. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, wasno very difficult point. To persuade him against returning intoHertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely thework of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. Thereis but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do notreflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt themeasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being intown. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but herbrother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met withoutill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to meenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps thisconcealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and itwas done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, noother apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, itwas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may toyou very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemnthem.""With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injuredMr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of hisconnection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me Iam ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon morethan one witness of undoubted veracity.""Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for manyyears the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose goodconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father tobe of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, hiskindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him atschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as hisown father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would havebeen unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not onlyfond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; hehad also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would behis profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it ismany, many years since I first began to think of him in a very differentmanner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he wascareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escapethe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degreeyou only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickhamhas created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me fromunfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.""My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment toMr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularlyrecommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best mannerthat his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that avaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. Therewas also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not longsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickhamwrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some moreimmediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which hecould not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studyinglaw, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds wouldbe a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believedhim to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede tohis proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; thebusiness was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistancein the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation toreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connectionbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite himto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chieflylived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now freefrom all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of theincumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied tome again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assuredme, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. Hehad found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutelyresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living inquestion--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he waswell assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could nothave forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blameme for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting everyrepetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress ofhis circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of meto others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period everyappearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. Butlast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.""I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfoldto any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of yoursecrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left tothe guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formedfor her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presidedover it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly bydesign; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between himand Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; andby her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness toher as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, andto consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be herexcuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owedthe knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or twobefore the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support theidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to asa father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt andhow I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings preventedany public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the placeimmediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, whichis thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope ofrevenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would havebeen complete indeed.""This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we havebeen concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it asfalse, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood hehad imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wonderedat. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not inyour inclination.""You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; butI was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought tobe revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal moreparticularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from ournear relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one ofthe executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquaintedwith every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented bythe same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may bethe possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find someopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of themorning. I will only add, God bless you.""FITZWILLIAM DARCY"""
Pride & Prejudice,36,"Chapter 36If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it tocontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all ofits contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerlyshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement didshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanationto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strongprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of whathad happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardlyleft her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what thenext sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense ofthe one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility sheinstantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worstobjections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doinghim justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfiedher; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride andinsolence.But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--whenshe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and whichbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--herfeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wishedto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, ""This must be false!This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!""--and when she hadgone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of thelast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would notregard it, that she would never look in it again.In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest onnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letterwas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, sheagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, andcommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly whathe had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, thoughshe had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his ownwords. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to thewill, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the livingwas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it wasimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or theother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes didnot err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, theparticulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensionsto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as threethousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put downthe letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to beimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but withlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she readon; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she hadbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as torender Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of aturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay atMr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she couldbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before hisentrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at thepersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of lifenothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. Asto his real character, had information been in her power, she hadnever felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner hadestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue. She triedto recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait ofintegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks ofMr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for thosecasual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcyhad described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. Butno such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly beforeher, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no moresubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, andthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. Afterpausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued toread. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on MissDarcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between ColonelFitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she wasreferred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliamhimself--from whom she had previously received the information of hisnear concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had noreason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying tohim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, andat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would neverhave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of hiscousin's corroboration.She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversationbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, andwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of puttinghimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professionswith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fearof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ballthe very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfieldfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one butherself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy'scharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father wouldalways prevent his exposing the son.How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely andhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longerthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he hadeither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifyinghis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had mostincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainterand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could notbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long agoasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive aswere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of theiracquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them muchtogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anythingthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke himof irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he wasesteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as abrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of hissister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had hisactions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation ofeverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; andthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable manas Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickhamcould she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,absurd.""How despicably I have acted!"" she cried; ""I, who have prided myselfon my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who haveoften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratifiedmy vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is thisdiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I couldnot have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been myfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglectof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courtedprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either wereconcerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.""From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a linewhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widelydifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny thatcredit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged togive in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of hersister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte'sopinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of hisdescription of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, werelittle displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her airand manner not often united with great sensibility.When she came to that part of the letter in which her family werementioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her senseof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forciblyfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded ashaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his firstdisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mindthan on hers.The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus beenself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she consideredthat Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearestrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurtby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything shehad ever known before.After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to everyvariety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden andso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, madeher at length return home; and she entered the house with the wishof appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing suchreflections as must make her unfit for conversation.She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had eachcalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to takeleave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at leastan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after hertill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concernin missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was nolonger an object; she could think only of her letter."
Pride & Prejudice,37,"Chapter 37The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins havingbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, wasable to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in verygood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after themelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he thenhastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his returnbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous ofhaving them all to dine with her.Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, hadshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her asher future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what herladyship's indignation would have been. ""What would she have said? howwould she have behaved?"" were questions with which she amused herself.Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. ""I assureyou, I feel it exceedingly,"" said Lady Catherine; ""I believe no onefeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularlyattached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached tome! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. Thedear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcyseemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. Hisattachment to Rosings certainly increases.""Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, whichwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out ofspirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing thatshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added:""But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg thatyou may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of yourcompany, I am sure.""""I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"" repliedElizabeth, ""but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in townnext Saturday.""""Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expectedyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. Therecan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainlyspare you for another fortnight.""""But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.""""Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughtersare never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stayanother _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you asfar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and asDawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good roomfor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, Ishould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.""""You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by ouroriginal plan.""Lady Catherine seemed resigned. ""Mrs. Collins, you must send a servantwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the ideaof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike inthe world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properlyguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When myniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of herhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter ofMr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared withpropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all thosethings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. Iam glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really bediscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.""""My uncle is to send a servant for us.""""Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad youhave somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will beattended to.""Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind sooccupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must bereserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to itas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitarywalk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasantrecollections.Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. Shestudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were attimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustlyshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned againstherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but shecould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own pastbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and inthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing atthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of hisyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from rightherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequentlyunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherineand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been alwaysaffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, wouldscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. Whilethere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and whileMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going thereforever.Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy'sexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was provedto have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless anycould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. Howgrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in everyrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane hadbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham'scharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which hadseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make italmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week ofher stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spentthere; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars oftheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only rightway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all thework of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished thema good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out herhand to both."
Pride & Prejudice,38,"Chapter 38On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a fewminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity ofpaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.""I know not, Miss Elizabeth,"" said he, ""whether Mrs. Collins has yetexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am verycertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks forit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. Weknow how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plainmanner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little wesee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady likeyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spendingyour time unpleasantly.""Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. Shehad spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being withCharlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smilingsolemnity replied:""It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time notdisagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunatelyhaving it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying thehumble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsfordvisit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard toLady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantageand blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. Yousee how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledgethat, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I shouldnot think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they aresharers of our intimacy at Rosings.""Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he wasobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civilityand truth in a few short sentences.""You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us intoHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you willbe able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins youhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appearthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will beas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity inmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way ofthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance ofcharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for eachother.""Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that wasthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believedand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, tohave the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But shehad chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting thather visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Herhome and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all theirdependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcelsplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionateparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage byMr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning herwith his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanksfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and hiscompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed herin, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they hadhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.""But,"" he added, ""you will of course wish to have your humble respectsdelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to youwhile you have been here.""Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, andthe carriage drove off.""Good gracious!"" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, ""it seemsbut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things havehappened!""""A great many indeed,"" said her companion with a sigh.""We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!How much I shall have to tell!""Elizabeth added privately, ""And how much I shall have to conceal!""Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; andwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner'shouse, where they were to remain a few days.Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying herspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of heraunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and atLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even forLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To knowthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonishJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her ownvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptationto openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecisionin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurriedinto repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sisterfurther."
Pride & Prejudice,39,"Chapter 39It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set outtogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriagewas to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman'spunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employedin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, anddressing a salad and cucumber.After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table setout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,""Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?""""And we mean to treat you all,"" added Lydia, ""but you must lend us themoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."" Then, showingher purchases--""Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not thinkit is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shallpull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up anybetter.""And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfectunconcern, ""Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; andwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, Ithink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify whatone wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and theyare going in a fortnight.""""Are they indeed!"" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.""They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa totake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like togo too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shallhave!""""Yes,"" thought Elizabeth, ""_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a wholecampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poorregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!""""Now I have got some news for you,"" said Lydia, as they sat down attable. ""What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and abouta certain person we all like!""Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he neednot stay. Lydia laughed, and said:""Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought thewaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worsethings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am gladhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now formy news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! Sheis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.""""And Mary King is safe!"" added Elizabeth; ""safe from a connectionimprudent as to fortune.""""She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.""""But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"" said Jane.""I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never caredthree straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckledthing?""Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of suchcoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage wasordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all theirboxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's andLydia's purchases, were seated in it.""How nicely we are all crammed in,"" cried Lydia. ""I am glad I bought mybonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, nowlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the wayhome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you allsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had anyflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husbandbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of notbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so toget husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I wouldchaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good pieceof fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spendthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in theevening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and soshe asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Penwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? Wedressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for alady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrowone of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, theydid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspectsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.""With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, didLydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse hercompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as shecould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Janein undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennetsay voluntarily to Elizabeth:""I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.""Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucasescame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects thatoccupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare andpoultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on onehand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who satsome way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the youngerLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody whowould hear her.""Oh! Mary,"" said she, ""I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended therewas nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kittyhad not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behavedvery handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest coldluncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treatedyou too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we nevershould have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And thenwe were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, thatanybody might have heard us ten miles off!""To this Mary very gravely replied, ""Far be it from me, my dear sister,to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with thegenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.""But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened toanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walkto Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadilyopposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets couldnot be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. Thecomfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyondexpression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hopedthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brightonscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was underfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that herfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers wereat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though oftendisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last."
Pride & Prejudice,40,"Chapter 40Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened couldno longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress everyparticular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to besurprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scenebetween Mr. Darcy and herself.Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterlypartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectlynatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She wassorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner solittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for theunhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.""His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,"" said she, ""and certainlyought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase hisdisappointment!""""Indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, ""I am heartily sorry for him; but he hasother feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?""""Blame you! Oh, no.""""But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?""""No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.""""But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very nextday.""She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as faras they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!who would willingly have gone through the world without believing thatso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was herecollected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, thoughgrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, andseek to clear the one without involving the other.""This will not do,"" said Elizabeth; ""you never will be able to make bothof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfiedwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; justenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shiftingabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;but you shall do as you choose.""It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.""I do not know when I have been more shocked,"" said she. ""Wickham sovery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, onlyconsider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with theknowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thingof his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel itso.""""Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you sofull of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I amgrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusionmakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart willbe as light as a feather.""""Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in hiscountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!""""There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of thosetwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all theappearance of it.""""I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as youused to do.""""And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a disliketo him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such anopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continuallyabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughingat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.""""Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treatthe matter as you do now.""""Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. Andwith no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and saythat I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew Ihad! Oh! how I wanted you!""""How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressionsin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear whollyundeserved.""""Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a mostnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. Thereis one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether Iought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understandWickham's character.""Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, ""Surely there can be nooccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?""""That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised meto make his communication public. On the contrary, every particularrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible tomyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of hisconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcyis so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people inMeryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equalto it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify toanyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. Atpresent I will say nothing about it.""""You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him forever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious tore-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.""The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She hadgot rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wishto talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the otherhalf of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely shehad been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no onecould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfectunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing offthis last encumbrance of mystery. ""And then,"" said she, ""if that veryimprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able totell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. Theliberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!""She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the realstate of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished avery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herselfin love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most firstattachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all herattention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check theindulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her ownhealth and their tranquillity.""Well, Lizzy,"" said Mrs. Bennet one day, ""what is your opinion _now_ ofthis sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speakof it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. ButI cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he isa very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the leastchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk ofhis coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired ofeverybody, too, who is likely to know.""""I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.""""Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though Ishall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, Iwould not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane willdie of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.""But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,she made no answer.""Well, Lizzy,"" continued her mother, soon afterwards, ""and so theCollinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hopeit will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is anexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as hermother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_housekeeping, I dare say.""""No, nothing at all.""""A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ willtake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressedfor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they oftentalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it asquite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.""""It was a subject which they could not mention before me.""""No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt theyoften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with anestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should beashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."""
Pride & Prejudice,41,"Chapter 41The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It wasthe last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladiesin the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almostuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Veryfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty andLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend suchhard-heartedness in any of the family.""Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?"" would theyoften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. ""How can you be smiling so,Lizzy?""Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered whatshe had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty yearsago.""I am sure,"" said she, ""I cried for two days together when ColonelMiller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.""""I am sure I shall break _mine_,"" said Lydia.""If one could but go to Brighton!"" observed Mrs. Bennet.""Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is sodisagreeable.""""A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.""""And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,""added Kitty.Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually throughLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all senseof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy'sobjections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon hisinterference in the views of his friend.But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for shereceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel ofthe regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was avery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humourand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out oftheir _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcelyto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydiaflew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone'scongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fatein terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.""I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,""said she, ""Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as muchright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.""In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to makeher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far fromexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that sheconsidered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sensefor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were itknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let hergo. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's generalbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship ofsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet moreimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations mustbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:""Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some publicplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with solittle expense or inconvenience to her family as under the presentcircumstances.""""If you were aware,"" said Elizabeth, ""of the very great disadvantage tous all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded andimprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure youwould judge differently in the affair.""""Already arisen?"" repeated Mr. Bennet. ""What, has she frightened awaysome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Suchsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdityare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows whohave been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.""""Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is notof particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Ourimportance, our respectability in the world must be affected by thewild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which markLydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dearfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, andof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business ofher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her characterwill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirtthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in theworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyondyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptinessof her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universalcontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this dangerKitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can yousuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised whereverthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in thedisgrace?""Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, andaffectionately taking her hand said in reply:""Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are knownyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to lessadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very sillysisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go toBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and willkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be anobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importanceeven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will findwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her beingthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot growmany degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the restof her life.""With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinioncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was notin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling onthem. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fretover unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of herdisposition.Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with herfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in theirunited volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprisedevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eyeof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of themat present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tentsstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the youngand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, shesaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least sixofficers at once.Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and suchrealities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could havebeen understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholyconviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their rapturescontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leavinghome.Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having beenfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was prettywell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had evenlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delightedher, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his presentbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions whichhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, afterwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him infinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolousgallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel thereproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatevercause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabethdisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making someinquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, shementioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent threeweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment'srecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seenhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:""How long did you say he was at Rosings?""""Nearly three weeks.""""And you saw him frequently?""""Yes, almost every day.""""His manners are very different from his cousin's.""""Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.""""Indeed!"" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. ""Andpray, may I ask?--"" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, ""Isit in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civilityto his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,"" he continued in a lowerand more serious tone, ""that he is improved in essentials.""""Oh, no!"" said Elizabeth. ""In essentials, I believe, he is very muchwhat he ever was.""While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether torejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was asomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensiveand anxious attention, while she added:""When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean thathis mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, fromknowing him better, his disposition was better understood.""Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitatedlook; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off hisembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest ofaccents:""You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readilycomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assumeeven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must onlydeter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I onlyfear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have beenalluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose goodopinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has alwaysoperated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to beimputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which Iam certain he has very much at heart.""Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by aslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her onthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulgehim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on hisside, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguishElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly amutual desire of never meeting again.When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separationbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was theonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss theopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice whichthere was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and inthe clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the moregentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard."
Pride & Prejudice,42,"Chapter 42Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she couldnot have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domesticcomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearanceof good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married awoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early intheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his viewsof domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not ofa disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his ownimprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too oftenconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond ofthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principalenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than asher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is notthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to hiswife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the truephilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of herfather's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; butrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment ofherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and tobanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligationand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her ownchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt sostrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of sounsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arisingfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, evenif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found littleother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their partiesabroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother andsister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything aroundthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kittymight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbersof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose dispositiongreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in allher folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as awatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, whathas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had beenlooking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all thesatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary toname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to havesome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and byagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for thepresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakeswas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolationfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her motherand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in thescheme, every part of it would have been perfect.""But it is fortunate,"" thought she, ""that I have something to wish for.Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in mysister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations ofpleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight cannever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off bythe defence of some little peculiar vexation.""When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutelyto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, andalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than thatthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officershad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments asmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, whichshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in aviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off tothe camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was stillless to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, weremuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, goodhumour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything worea happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter cameback again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennetwas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle ofJune, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton withouttears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that bythe following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not tomention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and maliciousarrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered inMeryton.The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fastapproaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letterarrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement andcurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business fromsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London againwithin a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go sofar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it withthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give upthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to thepresent plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In thatcounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their threeweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. Thetown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and wherethey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object ofher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,Dovedale, or the Peak.Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeingthe Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But itwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;and all was soon right again.With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It wasimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and itsowner. ""But surely,"" said she, ""I may enter his county with impunity,and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.""The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass awaybefore her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear atLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and twoyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of theircousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense andsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in everyway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off thenext morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bearinconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affectionand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there weredisappointments abroad.It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thitherlay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. aresufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the presentconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner'sformer residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintancestill remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all theprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was notin their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. Intalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressedan inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared hiswillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.""My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heardso much?"" said her aunt; ""a place, too, with which so many of youracquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, youknow.""Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business atPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. Shemust own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over somany, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. ""If it were merely a fine houserichly furnished,"" said she, ""I should not care about it myself; butthe grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in thecountry.""Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. Thepossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantlyoccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, andthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run sucha risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolvedthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to theabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaidwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of itsproprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down forthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and heralarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal ofcuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived thenext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, andwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any disliketo the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go."
Pride & Prejudice,43,"Chapter 43Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance ofPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turnedin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. Theyentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time througha beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admiredevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended forhalf-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerableeminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught byPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into whichthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stonebuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge ofhigh woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance wasswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its bankswere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. Shehad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where naturalbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They wereall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt thatto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension ofmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had beenmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into thehall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure towonder at her being where she was.The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much lessfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. Theyfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportionedroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, wentto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, whichthey had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; andshe looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on itsbanks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were takingdifferent positions; but from every window there were beauties to beseen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable tothe fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration ofhis taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less ofsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.""And of this place,"" thought she, ""I might have been mistress! Withthese rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead ofviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, andwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,""--recollectingherself--""that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost tome; I should not have been allowed to invite them.""This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very likeregret.She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was reallyabsent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the questionwas asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.Reynolds replied that he was, adding, ""But we expect him to-morrow, witha large party of friends."" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their ownjourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw thelikeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a younggentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been broughtup by him at his own expense. ""He is now gone into the army,"" she added;""but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.""Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could notreturn it.""And that,"" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,""is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as theother--about eight years ago.""""I have heard much of your master's fine person,"" said Mrs. Gardiner,looking at the picture; ""it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tellus whether it is like or not.""Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on thisintimation of her knowing her master.""Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?""Elizabeth coloured, and said: ""A little.""""And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?""""Yes, very handsome.""""I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs youwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my latemaster's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used tobe then. He was very fond of them.""This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawnwhen she was only eight years old.""And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?"" said Mrs. Gardiner.""Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and soaccomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room isa new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; shecomes here to-morrow with him.""Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged hercommunicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, eitherby pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of hermaster and his sister.""Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?""""Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half histime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.""""Except,"" thought Elizabeth, ""when she goes to Ramsgate.""""If your master would marry, you might see more of him.""""Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who isgood enough for him.""Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, ""It isvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.""""I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,""replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and shelistened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, ""I havenever known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him eversince he was four years old.""This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to herideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and wasgrateful to her uncle for saying:""There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky inhaving such a master.""""Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I couldnot meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who aregood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; andhe was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in theworld.""Elizabeth almost stared at her. ""Can this be Mr. Darcy?"" thought she.""His father was an excellent man,"" said Mrs. Gardiner.""Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--justas affable to the poor.""Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjectsof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of thefurniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of familyprejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of hermaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on hismany merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.""He is the best landlord, and the best master,"" said she, ""that everlived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing butthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will givehim a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never sawanything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle awaylike other young men.""""In what an amiable light does this place him!"" thought Elizabeth.""This fine account of him,"" whispered her aunt as they walked, ""is notquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.""""Perhaps we might be deceived.""""That is not very likely; our authority was too good.""On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very prettysitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness thanthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done togive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room whenlast at Pemberley.""He is certainly a good brother,"" said Elizabeth, as she walked towardsone of the windows.Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enterthe room. ""And this is always the way with him,"" she added. ""Whatevercan give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. Thereis nothing he would not do for her.""The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, wereall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been alreadyvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of MissDarcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, andalso more intelligible.In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could havelittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest ofthe only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrestedher--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such asmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when helooked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnestcontemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father'slifetime.There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentlesensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height oftheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynoldswas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praiseof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, sheconsidered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--howmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much ofgood or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been broughtforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as shestood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed hiseyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment ofgratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, andsoftened its impropriety of expression.When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, wereconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned backto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the formerwas conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himselfsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was hisappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyesinstantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepestblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable fromsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at leastof perfect civility.She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to beovercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picturethey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other twothat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, onbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a littlealoof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answershe returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at thealteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence thathe uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of theimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the fewminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable inher life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accenthad none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries asto the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed inDerbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke thedistraction of his thoughts.At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a fewmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and tookleave.The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; butElizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Hercoming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in theworld! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful lightmight it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposelythrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did hethus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutessooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alightedfrom his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again overthe perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikinglyaltered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her wasamazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, neverhad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. Whata contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he puthis letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to accountfor it.They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, andevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finerreach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some timebefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answeredmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, andseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, shedistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on thatone spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy thenwas. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--inwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because hefelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which wasnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure inseeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her withcomposure.At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mindaroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening ofthe trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of thevalley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreadingmany, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wishof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; whichbrought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossedit by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and thevalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed thebridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought onlyof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the houseon the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but theirprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge thetaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching theoccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to theman about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in thisslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishmentwas quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcyapproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being hereless sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him beforethey met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more preparedfor an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak withcalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idealasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; theturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she sawthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate hispoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;but she had not got beyond the words ""delightful,"" and ""charming,"" whensome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise ofPemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,and she said no more.Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he askedher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking theacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride hadrevolted in his offer to herself. ""What will be his surprise,"" thoughtshe, ""when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people offashion.""The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named theirrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he boreit, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as hecould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by theconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, andso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered intoconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she hadsome relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened mostattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in everyexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,his taste, or his good manners.The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcyinvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as hechose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same timeto supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts ofthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who waswalking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the complimentmust be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, andcontinually was she repeating, ""Why is he so altered? From what canit proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that hismanners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such achange as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.""After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the twogentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending tothe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curiouswater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originatedin Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, foundElizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferredher husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked ontogether. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished himto know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to theplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had beenvery unexpected--""for your housekeeper,"" she added, ""informed us thatyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before weleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expectedin the country."" He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said thatbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hoursbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. ""Theywill join me early to-morrow,"" he continued, ""and among them are somewho will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.""Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantlydriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the lastmentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_mind was not very differently engaged.""There is also one other person in the party,"" he continued after apause, ""who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allowme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintanceduring your stay at Lambton?""The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too greatfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately feltthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with hermust be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it wassatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not madehim think really ill of her.They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabethwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered andpleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment ofthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they hadreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of amile behind.He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself nottired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much mighthave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, butthere seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollectedthat she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dalewith great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and herpatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete wasover. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to gointo the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, andthey parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed theladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw himwalking slowly towards the house.The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of thempronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.""He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,"" said her uncle.""There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,"" replied heraunt, ""but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can nowsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, Ihave seen nothing of it.""""I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was morethan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for suchattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.""""To be sure, Lizzy,"" said her aunt, ""he is not so handsome as Wickham;or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his featuresare perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was sodisagreeable?""Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had likedhim better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had neverseen him so pleasant as this morning.""But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"" repliedher uncle. ""Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take himat his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me offhis grounds.""Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, butsaid nothing.""From what we have seen of him,"" continued Mrs. Gardiner, ""I reallyshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way byanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when hespeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that wouldnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, thegood lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberalmaster, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends everyvirtue.""Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication ofhis behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, inas guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard fromhis relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very differentconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, norWickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. Inconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniarytransactions in which they had been connected, without actually namingher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were nowapproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way tothe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing outto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think ofanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk theyhad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her formeracquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of aintercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabethmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothingbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, aboveall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister."
Pride & Prejudice,44,"Chapter 44Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visither the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequentlyresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after theirarrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about theplace with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the innto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of acarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady ina curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizingthe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of hersurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which sheexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassmentof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and manyof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea onthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt thatthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such aquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While thesenewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation ofElizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quiteamazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too muchin her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturallysuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walkedup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks ofinquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introductiontook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her newacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since herbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she wasonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word fromher beyond a monosyllable.Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, thoughlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearancewomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but therewas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectlyunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her asacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was muchrelieved by discerning such different feelings.They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingleywas also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express hersatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quickstep was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. AllElizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she stillfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffectedcordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. Heinquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and lookedand spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personagethan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party beforethem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had justarisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towardseach with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew fromthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knewwhat it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a littlein doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration wasevident enough.Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain thefeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, andto make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where shefeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom sheendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingleywas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed ina like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than onformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notionthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to hisbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No lookappeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurredbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this pointshe was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurredere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted arecollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of sayingmore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observedto her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tonewhich had something of real regret, that it ""was a very long time sincehe had had the pleasure of seeing her;"" and, before she could reply,he added, ""It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th ofNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.""Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwardstook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner whichgave them meaning.It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of generalcomplaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removedfrom _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her thatthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed howevertemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. Whenshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinionof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been adisgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to thevery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their lastlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change wasso great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardlyrestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the companyof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relationsat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free fromself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importancecould result from the success of his endeavours, and when even theacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would drawdown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield andRosings.Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they aroseto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressingtheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinnerat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with adiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowinghow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to itsacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment thanany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond ofsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage forher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabethagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries tomake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing allthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and onthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when theirvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with somesatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had beenlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from heruncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear theirfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it wasnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she wasmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much tointerest, but nothing to justify inquiry.Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as faras their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They couldnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his characterfrom their own feelings and his servant's report, without any referenceto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was knownwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensiblethat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was fouryears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to behastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence oftheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They hadnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-townwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that hewas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not heldthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with theson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-knownfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behindhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more thanthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was notlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. Shecertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and shehad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of hisvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for sometime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightenedinto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly inhis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance andacrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusationsaccompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoidher as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, mosteager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate displayof regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves onlywere concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and benton making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so muchpride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardentlove, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of asort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not beexactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know howfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it wouldbe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which herfancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal ofhis addresses.It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, thatsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on thevery day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to alate breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, thatit would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the followingmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though whenshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had beenrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meetingsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon."
Pride & Prejudice,45,"Chapter 45Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her hadoriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome herappearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with howmuch civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windowsopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woodyhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnutswhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting therewith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived inLondon. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended withall the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fearof doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferiorthe belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,however, did her justice, and pitied her.By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, agenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kindof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of theothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help fromElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if shewished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture ashort sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, withoutcalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented herfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at aninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessityof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected everymoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, shefeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whethershe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. Aftersitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing MissBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a coldinquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equalindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by theentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all thefinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after manya significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had beengiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the wholeparty--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and thebeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collectedthem round the table.While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whethershe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by thefeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though buta moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began toregret that he came.He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three othergentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left himonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit toGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wiselyresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the morenecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because shesaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviourwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentivecuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of thesmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of itsobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentionsto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother'sentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that hewas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwardedas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. MissBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took thefirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:""Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?They must be a great loss to _your_ family.""In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabethinstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and thevarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, shepresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. Whileshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightenedcomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome withconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known whatpain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly wouldhave refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discomposeElizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believedher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her inDarcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the folliesand absurdities by which some part of her family were connectedwith that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy'smeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecywas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connectionsher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the verywish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becominghereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and withoutmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from MissBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concernfor the welfare of his friend.Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; andas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer toWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be ableto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcelyrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance whichhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to havefixed them on her more and more cheerfully.Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer abovementioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage MissBingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother'srecommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could noterr. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgianawithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. WhenDarcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating tohim some part of what she had been saying to his sister.""How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"" shecried; ""I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is sincethe winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeingthat we should not have known her again.""However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contentedhimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration thanher being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in thesummer.""For my own part,"" she rejoined, ""I must confess that I never couldsee any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has nobrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nosewants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth aretolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anythingextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I donot like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiencywithout fashion, which is intolerable.""Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was notthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not alwayswise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all thesuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from adetermination of making him speak, she continued:""I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we allwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollectyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards sheseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty atone time.""""Yes,"" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, ""but _that_was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I haveconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.""He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction ofhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during theirvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested themboth. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talkedof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything buthimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought ofhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece'sbeginning the subject."
Pride & Prejudice,46,"Chapter 46Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter fromJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had beenrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; buton the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by thereceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked thatit had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, asJane had written the direction remarkably ill.They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; andher uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off bythemselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had beenwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all theirlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evidentagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:""Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of amost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--beassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotlandwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine oursurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I amvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willingto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice isdisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. Howthankful am I that we never let them know what has been said againsthim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night abouttwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning ateight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must havepassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expecthim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her oftheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poormother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardlyknow what I have written.""Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowingwhat she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized theother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: ithad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.""By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; Iwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, myhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. DearestLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickhamand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it hastaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not goneto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton theday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's shortletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to GretnaGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which wasrepeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackneycoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All thatis known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on thatside London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewingthem at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, butwithout any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. Withthe kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensionsto us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grievedfor him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Ourdistress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe theworst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might makeit more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursuetheir first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against ayoung woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I supposeher so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, thatColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook hishead when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man tobe trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could sheexert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. Andas to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty hasanger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter ofconfidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that youhave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as thefirst shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am notso selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! Itake up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; butcircumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all tocome here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still somethingmore to ask of the former. My father is going to London with ColonelForster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sureI know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue anymeasure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged tobe at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, myuncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he willimmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""""Oh! where, where is my uncle?"" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seatas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losinga moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it wasopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuousmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,hastily exclaimed, ""I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must findMr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have notan instant to lose.""""Good God! what is the matter?"" cried he, with more feeling thanpoliteness; then recollecting himself, ""I will not detain you a minute;but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You arenot well enough; you cannot go yourself.""Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt howlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling backthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathlessan accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master andmistress home instantly.On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, andlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,""Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give youpresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.""""No, I thank you,"" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. ""Thereis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed bysome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.""She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes couldnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only saysomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionatesilence. At length she spoke again. ""I have just had a letter from Jane,with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My youngersister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself intothe power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton._You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, noconnections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.""Darcy was fixed in astonishment. ""When I consider,"" she added in a yetmore agitated voice, ""that I might have prevented it! I, who knew whathe was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what Ilearnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could nothave happened. But it is all--all too late now.""""I am grieved indeed,"" cried Darcy; ""grieved--shocked. But is itcertain--absolutely certain?""""Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were tracedalmost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone toScotland.""""And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?""""My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle'simmediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. Butnothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How issuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I havenot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!""Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.""When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known whatI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing toomuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!""Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walkingup and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his airgloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Herpower was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of familyweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neitherwonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothingconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. Itwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her ownwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have lovedhim, as now, when all love must be vain.But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--thehumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowedup every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause ofseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation bythe voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spokecompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, ""I am afraid you have beenlong desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of mystay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anythingcould be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation tosuch distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which mayseem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, Ifear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberleyto-day.""""Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say thaturgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth aslong as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.""He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow forher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at presentreason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with onlyone serious, parting look, went away.As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that theyshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality ashad marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw aretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so fullof contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of thosefeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and wouldformerly have rejoiced in its termination.If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth'schange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But ifotherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable orunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising ona first interview with its object, and even before two words have beenexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had givensomewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the otherless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw himgo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy mustproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretchedbusiness. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertaineda hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the leastof her feelings on this development. While the contents of the firstletter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment thatWickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marryfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appearedincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachmentas this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not supposeLydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intentionof marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtuenor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, thatLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydiawanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes oneofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentionsraised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually beenfluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect andmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she nowfeel it!She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot toshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in afamily so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, andrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothingcould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmostimportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant'saccount that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying theminstantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of theirsummons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscriptof the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been afavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeplyafflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after thefirst exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised everyassistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thankedhim with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were tobe off as soon as possible. ""But what is to be done about Pemberley?""cried Mrs. Gardiner. ""John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent forus; was it so?""""Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement._That_ is all settled.""""What is all settled?"" repeated the other, as she ran into her room toprepare. ""And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the realtruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!""But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in thehurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisureto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment wasimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share ofbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes tobe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for theirsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothingremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery ofthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she couldhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn."
Pride & Prejudice,47,"Chapter 47""I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"" said her uncle, as theydrove from the town; ""and really, upon serious consideration, I am muchmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on thematter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man shouldform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected orfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that Iam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friendswould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by theregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation isnot adequate to the risk!""""Do you really think so?"" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.""Upon my word,"" said Mrs. Gardiner, ""I begin to be of your uncle'sopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, andinterest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill ofWickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believehim capable of it?""""Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every otherneglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But Idare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had beenthe case?""""In the first place,"" replied Mr. Gardiner, ""there is no absolute proofthat they are not gone to Scotland.""""Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is sucha presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on theBarnet road.""""Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, thoughfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It isnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and itmight strike them that they could be more economically, though lessexpeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.""""But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must theirmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particularfriend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intendingto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. Hecannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has shebeyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to whatrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on adishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I knownothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to yourother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia hasno brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father'sbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has everseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ woulddo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, insuch a matter.""""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of himas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?""""It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, withtears in her eyes, ""that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in sucha point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has neverbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusementand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idleand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doingeverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to givegreater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which arenaturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm ofperson and address that can captivate a woman.""""But you see that Jane,"" said her aunt, ""does not think so very ill ofWickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.""""Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might betheir former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, whatWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in everysense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he isas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.""""And do you really know all this?"" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosityas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.""I do indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, colouring. ""I told you, the other day,of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last atLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behavedwith such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are othercircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while torelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. Fromwhat he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. Hemust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have foundher.""""But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what youand Jane seem so well to understand?""""Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and sawso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I wasignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shirewas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was thecase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought itnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use couldit apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all theneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it wassettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of openingher eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could bein any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such aconsequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was farenough from my thoughts.""""When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, Isuppose, to believe them fond of each other?""""Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on eitherside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be awarethat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When firsthe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we allwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him forthe first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particularattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant andwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.""                          * * * * *It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be addedto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, byits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, duringthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could findno interval of ease or forgetfulness.They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one nighton the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was acomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been weariedby long expectations.The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standingon the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when thecarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up theirfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety ofcapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from hermother's apartment, immediately met her.Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled theeyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had beenheard of the fugitives.""Not yet,"" replied Jane. ""But now that my dear uncle is come, I hopeeverything will be well.""""Is my father in town?""""Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.""""And have you heard from him often?""""We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to saythat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which Iparticularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not writeagain till he had something of importance to mention.""""And my mother--how is she? How are you all?""""My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatlyshaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing youall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thankHeaven, are quite well.""""But you--how are you?"" cried Elizabeth. ""You look pale. How much youmust have gone through!""Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and theirconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner wereengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approachof the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed andthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabethhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soonfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope ofgood, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yetdeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and thatevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; withtears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainousconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence theerrors of her daughter must principally be owing.""If I had been able,"" said she, ""to carry my point in going to Brighton,with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydiahad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go outof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on theirside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had beenwell looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have thecharge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to becomeof us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in hisgrave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what weshall do.""They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, aftergeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told herthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.""Do not give way to useless alarm,"" added he; ""though it is right to beprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more wemay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over aslost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and makehim come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consulttogether as to what is to be done.""""Oh! my dear brother,"" replied Mrs. Bennet, ""that is exactly what Icould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ themmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, buttell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of mywits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--suchspasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, thatI can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not togive any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she doesnot know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! Iknow you will contrive it all.""But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavoursin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as wellin her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner tilldinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings onthe housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no realoccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt tooppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold hertongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged itbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they couldmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on thesubject.In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had beentoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearancebefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. Thefaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visiblein either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the angerwhich she had herself incurred in this business, had given more offretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she wasmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenanceof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:""This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms ofeach other the balm of sisterly consolation.""Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,""Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this usefullesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that onefalse step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no lessbrittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded inher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.""Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressedto make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with suchkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be forhalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself ofthe opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager tosatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequelof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and MissBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continuedthe subject, by saying, ""But tell me all and everything about it whichI have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did ColonelForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopementtook place? They must have seen them together for ever.""""Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am sogrieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he hadany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehensionfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.""""And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know oftheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?""""Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything oftheir plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did notrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I aminclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.""""And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained adoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?""""How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felta little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with himin marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quiteright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt howimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very naturaltriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last lettershe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of theirbeing in love with each other, many weeks.""""But not before they went to Brighton?""""No, I believe not.""""And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Doeshe know his real character?""""I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerlydid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sadaffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;but I hope this may be false.""""Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,this could not have happened!""""Perhaps it would have been better,"" replied her sister. ""But to exposethe former faults of any person without knowing what their presentfeelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.""""Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to hiswife?""""He brought it with him for us to see.""Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. Thesewere the contents:""MY DEAR HARRIET,""You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot helplaughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I ammissed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world Ilove, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so thinkit no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of mygoing, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good jokeit will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses toPratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I willdance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shallsend for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tellSally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they arepacked up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you willdrink to our good journey.""Your affectionate friend,""LYDIA BENNET.""""Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!"" cried Elizabeth when she hadfinished it. ""What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of theirjourney. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on herside a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!""""I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full tenminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house insuch confusion!""""Oh! Jane,"" cried Elizabeth, ""was there a servant belonging to it whodid not know the whole story before the end of the day?""""I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time isvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured togive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do somuch as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happenalmost took from me my faculties.""""Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not lookwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxietyupon yourself alone.""""Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in everyfatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hoursof repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbournon Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay tillThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. AndLady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning tocondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', ifthey should be of use to us.""""She had better have stayed at home,"" cried Elizabeth; ""perhaps she_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot seetoo little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolenceinsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.""She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father hadintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.""He meant I believe,"" replied Jane, ""to go to Epsom, the place wherethey last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything couldbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover thenumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had comewith a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of agentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another mightbe remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhowdiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, hedetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossibleto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of anyother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in findingout even so much as this."""
Pride & Prejudice,48,"Chapter 48The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the nextmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent anddilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence tosend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constantinformation of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the onlysecurity for her husband's not being killed in a duel.Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a fewdays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceableto her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was agreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt alsovisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design ofcheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came withoutreporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she foundthem.All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three monthsbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debtto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured withthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted theappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit abovehalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance ofher sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still lessof it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now comewhen, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirelydespaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news ofthem.Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received aletter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediatelyfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was nowdetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennetthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their firstcoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himselfdid not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother waseager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promisedto write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:""I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, ifpossible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely toknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there wereanyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such aclue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we havenothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything inhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than anyother person.""Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to herauthority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any informationof so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had neverheard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, bothof whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some ofhis companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the applicationwas a something to look forward to.Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxiouspart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letterswas the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and everysucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived fortheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Janehad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities hisletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was asfollows:""MY DEAR SIR,""I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situationin life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are nowsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter fromHertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myselfsincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, inyour present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, becauseproceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall bewanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or thatmay comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others themost afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter wouldhave been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more tobe lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotteinforms me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter hasproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to thinkthat her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not beguilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joinedby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, towhom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending thatthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes ofall the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leadsme moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain eventof last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involvedin all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, toconsole yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy childfrom your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of herown heinous offense.""I am, dear sir, etc., etc.""Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer fromColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom hekept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near oneliving. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since hehad been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms ofparticular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in thewretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive forsecrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, forit had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to avery considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than athousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still moreformidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particularsfrom the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. ""A gamester!""she cried. ""This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.""Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see theirfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Renderedspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yieldedto his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, andleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisablefor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she didnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, consideringwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.""What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?"" she cried. ""Sure hewill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,and make him marry her, if he comes away?""As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that sheand the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennetcame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of theirjourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and herDerbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. Hisname had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; andthe kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of theirbeing followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth hadreceived none since her return that could come from Pemberley.The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse forthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could befairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this timetolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly awarethat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread ofLydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,one sleepless night out of two.When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usualphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in thehabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken himaway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak ofit.It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, thatElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her brieflyexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, ""Saynothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,and I ought to feel it.""""You must not be too severe upon yourself,"" replied Elizabeth.""You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so proneto fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I havebeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.It will pass away soon enough.""""Do you suppose them to be in London?""""Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?""""And Lydia used to want to go to London,"" added Kitty.""She is happy then,"" said her father drily; ""and her residence therewill probably be of some duration.""Then after a short silence he continued:""Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to melast May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.""They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother'stea.""This is a parade,"" he cried, ""which does one good; it gives such anelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in mylibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble asI can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.""""I am not going to run away, papa,"" said Kitty fretfully. ""If I shouldever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.""""_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbournefor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, andyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter intomy house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will beabsolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you havespent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.""Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.""Well, well,"" said he, ""do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a goodgirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end ofthem."""
Pride & Prejudice,49,"Chapter 49Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walkingtogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeepercoming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to theirmother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, ""I beg your pardon,madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got somegood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.""""What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.""""Dear madam,"" cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, ""don't you knowthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been herethis half-hour, and master has had a letter.""Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. Theyran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to thelibrary; their father was in neither; and they were on the point ofseeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by thebutler, who said:""If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards thelittle copse.""Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall oncemore, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberatelypursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running asElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,came up with him, and eagerly cried out:""Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?""""Yes I have had a letter from him by express.""""Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?""""What is there of good to be expected?"" said he, taking the letter fromhis pocket. ""But perhaps you would like to read it.""Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.""Read it aloud,"" said their father, ""for I hardly know myself what it isabout.""""Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.""MY DEAR BROTHER,""At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after youleft me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part ofLondon they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enoughto know they are discovered. I have seen them both--""""Then it is as I always hoped,"" cried Jane; ""they are married!""Elizabeth read on:""I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find therewas any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform theengagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it willnot be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assureto your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousandpounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself andmy sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditionswhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this byexpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. Youwill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham'scircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say therewill be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, tosettle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I concludewill be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughoutthe whole of this business, I will immediately give directions toHaggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be thesmallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet atLongbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer asfast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged itbest that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hopeyou will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon asanything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,""EDW. GARDINER.""""Is it possible?"" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. ""Can it bepossible that he will marry her?""""Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,"" said hersister. ""My dear father, I congratulate you.""""And have you answered the letter?"" cried Elizabeth.""No; but it must be done soon.""Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before hewrote.""Oh! my dear father,"" she cried, ""come back and write immediately.Consider how important every moment is in such a case.""""Let me write for you,"" said Jane, ""if you dislike the troubleyourself.""""I dislike it very much,"" he replied; ""but it must be done.""And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.""And may I ask--"" said Elizabeth; ""but the terms, I suppose, must becomplied with.""""Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.""""And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!""""Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But thereare two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much moneyyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I everto pay him.""""Money! My uncle!"" cried Jane, ""what do you mean, sir?""""I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight atemptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I amgone.""""That is very true,"" said Elizabeth; ""though it had not occurred to mebefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he hasdistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.""""No,"" said her father; ""Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthingless than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,in the very beginning of our relationship.""""Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to berepaid?""Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continuedsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to thelibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.""And they are really to be married!"" cried Elizabeth, as soon as theywere by themselves. ""How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to bethankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!""""I comfort myself with thinking,"" replied Jane, ""that he certainly wouldnot marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kinduncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that tenthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has childrenof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousandpounds?""""If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"" saidElizabeth, ""and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shallexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham hasnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can neverbe requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personalprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage asyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she isactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when shefirst sees my aunt!""""We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"" saidJane: ""I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting tomarry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way ofthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myselfthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may intime make their past imprudence forgotten.""""Their conduct has been such,"" replied Elizabeth, ""as neither you, norI, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.""It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihoodperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to makeit known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coollyreplied:""Just as you please.""""May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?""""Take whatever you like, and get away.""Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairstogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communicationwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. Assoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soonmarried, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to itsexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as shehad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughterwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for herfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.""My dear, dear Lydia!"" she cried. ""This is delightful indeed! She willbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manageeverything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But theclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner aboutthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask himhow much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dearLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!""Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence ofthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.""For we must attribute this happy conclusion,"" she added, ""in a greatmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself toassist Mr. Wickham with money.""""Well,"" cried her mother, ""it is all very right; who should do it buther own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my childrenmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we haveever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How wellit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am insuch a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, andyou write for me. We will settle with your father about the moneyafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.""She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, andcambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, hadnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till herfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quiteso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.""I will go to Meryton,"" said she, ""as soon as I am dressed, and tell thegood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can callon Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I doanything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have youheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shallall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.""Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received hercongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, tookrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it wasno worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, inlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity couldbe justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they hadfeared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they hadgained."
Pride & Prejudice,50,"Chapter 50Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum forthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survivedhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in thatrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whateverof honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction ofprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to beher husband might then have rested in its proper place.He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyoneshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and hewas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectlyuseless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to joinin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widowand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughterssuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that hewould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was thentoo late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and herhusband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding theirincome.Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet andthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst thelatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, withregard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennetcould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. Interms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfectapprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil theengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposedthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it wouldbe done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the presentarrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by thehundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocketallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to herthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little withinthat sum.That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, wasanother very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have aslittle trouble in the business as possible. When the first transportsof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, henaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soondispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quickin its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what hewas indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send anymessage to her.The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionatespeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decentphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantageof conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as thehappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distantfarmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and thegood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before fromall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spiritin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her miserywas considered certain.It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on thishappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and inspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to hertriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first objectof her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point ofaccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on thoseattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, andservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for aproper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or consideringwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size andimportance.""Haye Park might do,"" said she, ""if the Gouldings could quit it--or thegreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth istoo far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as forPulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.""Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while theservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: ""Mrs.Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son anddaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in thisneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage theimpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.""A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. Itsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for hisdaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark ofaffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehendit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivableresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which hermarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believepossible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of newclothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense ofshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before theytook place.Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress ofthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears forher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give theproper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal itsunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on thespot.She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There werefew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister'sfrailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fearof disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage beenconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed thatMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every otherobjection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of thenearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. Thewish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of hisfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such ablow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though shehardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could nolonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when thereseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced thatshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely theyshould meet.What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that theproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would nowhave been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, shedoubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,there must be a triumph.She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, indisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding andtemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. Itwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her easeand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, shemust have received benefit of greater importance.But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude whatconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, andprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in theirfamily.How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness couldbelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passionswere stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.                          * * * * *Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet'sacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness topromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreatiesthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principalpurport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolvedon quitting the militia.""It was greatly my wish that he should do so,"" he added, ""as soon ashis marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, inconsidering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both onhis account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go intothe regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some whoare able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of anensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. Itis an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. Hepromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may eachhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I havewritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickhamin and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which Ihave pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carryingsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoina list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; Ihope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before sheleaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered toyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.,""E. GARDINER.""Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removalfrom the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennetwas not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing inHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such apity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquaintedwith everybody, and had so many favourites.""She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,"" said she, ""it will be quite shockingto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that shelikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'sregiment.""His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of beingadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings andconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive herand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he wasprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And theirmother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to showher married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to theNorth. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he senthis permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon asthe ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth wassurprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, andhad she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him wouldhave been the last object of her wishes."
Pride & Prejudice,51,"Chapter 51Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for herprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent tomeet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Theirarrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had shebeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sistermust endure.They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receivethem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up tothe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,anxious, uneasy.Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, andshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, andwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with analacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quiteso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcelyopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, wasenough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennetwas shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding theircongratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerlyround the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, andobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had beenthere.Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his mannerswere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage beenexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while heclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth hadnot before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudenceof an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of thetwo who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neitherof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit nearElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in herreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in theworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia ledvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to forthe world.""Only think of its being three months,"" she cried, ""since I went away;it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been thingsenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sureI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though Ithought it would be very good fun if I was.""Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth lookedexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything ofwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, ""Oh! mamma, do thepeople hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined heshould know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and tookoff my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so thathe might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.""Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall tothe dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, withanxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her sayto her eldest sister, ""Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must golower, because I am a married woman.""It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassmentfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and goodspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, andall their other neighbours, and to hear herself called ""Mrs. Wickham""by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show herring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.""Well, mamma,"" said she, when they were all returned to the breakfastroom, ""and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? Iam sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have halfmy good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to gethusbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.""""Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don'tat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?""""Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of allthings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. Weshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be someballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.""""I should like it beyond anything!"" said her mother.""And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sistersbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before thewinter is over.""""I thank you for my share of the favour,"" said Elizabeth; ""but I do notparticularly like your way of getting husbands.""Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickhamhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to joinhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; andshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, andhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable toall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as didthink, than such as did not.Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expectedto find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed herpresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, thattheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, ratherthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caringfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certainthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; andif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunityof having a companion.Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on everyoccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds onthe first of September, than any body else in the country.One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her twoelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:""Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. Youwere not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not youcurious to hear how it was managed?""""No really,"" replied Elizabeth; ""I think there cannot be too little saidon the subject.""""La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We weremarried, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were inthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleveno'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the otherswere to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was insuch a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen toput it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there wasmy aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just asif she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word inten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longedto know whether he would be married in his blue coat.""""Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would neverbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and auntwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believeme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there afortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London wasrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and sojust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away uponbusiness to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when oncethey get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened Idid not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if wewere beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, hecame back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, thewedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.""""Mr. Darcy!"" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.""Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But graciousme! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promisedthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!""""If it was to be secret,"" said Jane, ""say not another word on thesubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.""""Oh! certainly,"" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; ""we willask you no questions.""""Thank you,"" said Lydia, ""for if you did, I should certainly tell youall, and then Wickham would be angry.""On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of herpower, by running away.But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at leastit was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been ather sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into herbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, asplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. Shecould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of whatLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had beenintended.""You may readily comprehend,"" she added, ""what my curiosity must beto know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparativelyspeaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at sucha time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seemsto think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied withignorance.""""Not that I _shall_, though,"" she added to herself, as she finishedthe letter; ""and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourablemanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find itout.""Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak toElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was gladof it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive anysatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante."
Pride & Prejudice,52,"Chapter 52Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter assoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of itthan, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely tobe interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared tobe happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did notcontain a denial.""Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.""MY DEAR NIECE,""I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morningto answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprisewhat I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by yourapplication; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined suchinquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose tounderstand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprisedas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concernedwould have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are reallyinnocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.""On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a mostunexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him severalhours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not sodreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one dayafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting forthem. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing tohimself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as tomake it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confidein him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, andconfessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his privateactions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. Hecalled it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedyan evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some daysin town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something todirect his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousnessof this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.""There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time agogoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some causeof disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a largehouse in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by lettinglodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted withWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got totown. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what hewanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery andcorruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and hadshe been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken uptheir abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured thewished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, andafterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, heacknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgracefulsituation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailedon to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. Buthe found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She caredfor none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hearof leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time orother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had neverbeen _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; andscrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on herown folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and asto his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. Hemust go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should havenothing to live on.""Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. ThoughMr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been ableto do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited bymarriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham stillcherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage insome other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likelyto be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.""They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham ofcourse wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to bereasonable.""Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was tomake your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurchstreet the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not beseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father wasstill with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judgeyour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as youruncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after thedeparture of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the nextday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.""On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.""They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not allsettled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off toLongbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, thatobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has beenaccused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (andI do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), youruncle would most readily have settled the whole.""They battled it together for a long time, which was more than eitherthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your unclewas forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to hisniece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letterthis morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanationthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise whereit was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Janeat most.""You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the youngpeople. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerablymore than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her ownsettled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why allthis was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. Itwas owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, thatWickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that hehad been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truthin _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle wouldnever have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _anotherinterest_ in the affair.""When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, whowere still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be inLondon once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters werethen to receive the last finish.""I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation whichyou tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will notafford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constantadmission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when Iknew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I wassatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had notperceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on cominghome was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tellyou can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the mostserious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she haddone, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If sheheard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I wassometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth andJane, and for their sakes had patience with her.""Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leavetown again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, mydear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never boldenough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. Hisunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a littlemore liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teachhim. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. Butslyness seems the fashion.""Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do notpunish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happytill I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice littlepair of ponies, would be the very thing.""But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this halfhour.""Yours, very sincerely,""M. GARDINER.""The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore thegreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty hadproduced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister'smatch, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness toogreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from thepain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself allthe trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in whichsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate anddespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reasonwith, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished toavoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He haddone all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Herheart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortlychecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanitywas insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--fora woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment sonatural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-lawof Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he hadgiven a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinarystretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had beenwrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; andthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement, shecould, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assisthis endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materiallyconcerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they wereunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return. Theyowed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had everencouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. Forherself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a causeof compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. Itwas hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of somepleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both sheand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsistedbetween Mr. Darcy and herself.She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one'sapproach; and before she could strike into another path, she wasovertaken by Wickham.""I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"" said he,as he joined her.""You certainly do,"" she replied with a smile; ""but it does not followthat the interruption must be unwelcome.""""I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; andnow we are better.""""True. Are the others coming out?""""I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage toMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, thatyou have actually seen Pemberley.""She replied in the affirmative.""I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too muchfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw theold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond ofme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.""""Yes, she did.""""And what did she say?""""That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turnedout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangelymisrepresented.""""Certainly,"" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she hadsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said:""I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each otherseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.""""Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,"" saidElizabeth. ""It must be something particular, to take him there at thistime of year.""""Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought Iunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.""""Yes; he introduced us to his sister.""""And do you like her?""""Very much.""""I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this yearor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very gladyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.""""I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.""""Did you go by the village of Kympton?""""I do not recollect that we did.""""I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. Amost delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suitedme in every respect.""""How should you have liked making sermons?""""Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not torepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! Thequiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideasof happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention thecircumstance, when you were in Kent?""""I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it wasleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.""""You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from thefirst, you may remember.""""I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was notso palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actuallydeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the businesshad been compromised accordingly.""""You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may rememberwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.""They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fastto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:""Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not letus quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of onemind.""She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, thoughhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house."
Pride & Prejudice,53,"Chapter 53Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that henever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that shehad said enough to keep him quiet.The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet wasforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no meansentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely tocontinue at least a twelvemonth.""Oh! my dear Lydia,"" she cried, ""when shall we meet again?""""Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.""""Write to me very often, my dear.""""As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time forwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else todo.""Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. Hesmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.""He is as fine a fellow,"" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out ofthe house, ""as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love tous all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucashimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.""The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.""I often think,"" said she, ""that there is nothing so bad as parting withone's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.""""This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,"" saidElizabeth. ""It must make you better satisfied that your other four aresingle.""""It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. Ifthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.""But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortlyrelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by anarticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeperat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of hermaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for severalweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, andsmiled and shook her head by turns.""Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"" (for Mrs.Phillips first brought her the news). ""Well, so much the better. Notthat I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I amsure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcometo come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never tomention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?""""You may depend on it,"" replied the other, ""for Mrs. Nicholls was inMeryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purposeto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. Hecomes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She wasgoing to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat onWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.""Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changingcolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name toElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:""I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the presentreport; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was fromany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt thatI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affectme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comesalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.""Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him inDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with noother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partialto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his comingthere _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to comewithout it.""Yet it is hard,"" she sometimes thought, ""that this poor man cannotcome to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all thisspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.""In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be herfeelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easilyperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,more unequal, than she had often seen them.The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.""As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""youwill wait on him of course.""""No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if Iwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended innothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.""His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attentionwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning toNetherfield.""'Tis an etiquette I despise,"" said he. ""If he wants our society,let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hoursin running after my neighbours every time they go away and come backagain.""""Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not waiton him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, Iam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That willmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table forhim.""Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear herhusband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that herneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--""I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,"" said Jane to her sister. ""Itwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I canhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what shesays. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!""""I wish I could say anything to comfort you,"" replied Elizabeth; ""but itis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfactionof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you havealways so much.""Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxietyand fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She countedthe days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after hisarrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,enter the paddock and ride towards the house.Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutelykept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, wentto the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat downagain by her sister.""There is a gentleman with him, mamma,"" said Kitty; ""who can it be?""""Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do notknow.""""La!"" replied Kitty, ""it looks just like that man that used to be withhim before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.""""Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend ofMr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I mustsay that I hate the very sight of him.""Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but littleof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardnesswhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first timeafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortableenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and theirmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to becivil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by eitherof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not besuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensiveinformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebtedfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with aninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just aswhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at hiscoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his alteredbehaviour in Derbyshire.The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half aminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre toher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection andwishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.""Let me first see how he behaves,"" said she; ""it will then be earlyenough for expectation.""She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring tolift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face ofher sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a littlepaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On thegentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them withtolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from anysymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat downagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. Shehad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than asshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother'spresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, butnot an improbable, conjecture.Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short periodsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness ofher curtsey and address to his friend.Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latterthe preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so illapplied.Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a questionwhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. Hewas not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; butit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed withoutbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resistthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as oftenfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object butthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than whenthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angrywith herself for being so.""Could I expect it to be otherwise!"" said she. ""Yet why did he come?""She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and tohim she had hardly courage to speak.She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.""It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"" said Mrs. Bennet.He readily agreed to it.""I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ sayyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hopeit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of myown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must haveseen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being asyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came tomake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?""Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabethdared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she couldnot tell.""It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,""continued her mother, ""but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is veryhard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down toNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stayI do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you haveheard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into theregulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not somany as he deserves.""Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in suchmisery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectuallydone before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay inthe country at present. A few weeks, he believed.""When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,"" said her mother,""I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, andwill save all the best of the covies for you.""Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officiousattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as hadflattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would behastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she feltthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends formoments of such painful confusion.""The first wish of my heart,"" said she to herself, ""is never more tobe in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasurethat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see eitherone or the other again!""Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer nocompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observinghow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of herformer lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. Hefound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, andas unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that nodifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuadedthat she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,that she did not always know when she was silent.When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of herintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine atLongbourn in a few days time.""You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,"" she added, ""for whenyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner withus, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assureyou, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keepyour engagement.""Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something ofhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dinethere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she didnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a manon whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and prideof one who had ten thousand a year."
Pride & Prejudice,54,"Chapter 54As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects thatmust deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.""Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"" said she,""did he come at all?""She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.""He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, whenhe was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? Ifhe no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I willthink no more about him.""Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approachof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed herbetter satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.""Now,"" said she, ""that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectlyeasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again byhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publiclyseen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferentacquaintance.""""Yes, very indifferent indeed,"" said Elizabeth, laughingly. ""Oh, Jane,take care.""""My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?""""I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love withyou as ever.""                          * * * * *They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, inthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the goodhumour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, hadrevived.On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the twowho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctualityas sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to thedining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would takethe place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, byher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forboreto invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed tohesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it wasdecided. He placed himself by her.Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined thatBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyeslikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughingalarm.His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed anadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuadedElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and hisown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon theconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. Itgave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was inno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the tablecould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how littlesuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear toadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, butshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal andcold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tellhim that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of thefamily.She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity ofbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass awaywithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation thanthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxiousand uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before thegentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made heruncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which allher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.""If he does not come to me, _then_,"" said she, ""I shall give him up forever.""The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would haveanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near herwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one ofthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:""The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;do we?""Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him withher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enoughto help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself forbeing so silly!""A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough toexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would notprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!""She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cuphimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:""Is your sister at Pemberley still?""""Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.""""And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?""""Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,these three weeks.""She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to conversewith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, forsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whisperingto Elizabeth again, he walked away.When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladiesall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to hermother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seatedwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she hadnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her sideof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen tosupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of theothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.""Well girls,"" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, ""Whatsay you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. Thevenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw sofat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at theLucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridgeswere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three Frenchcooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greaterbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. Andwhat do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have herat Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as gooda creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.""Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough ofBingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him atlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happyhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed atnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.""It has been a very agreeable day,"" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. ""Theparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope wemay often meet again.""Elizabeth smiled.""Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as anagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I amperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never hadany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessedwith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generallypleasing, than any other man.""""You are very cruel,"" said her sister, ""you will not let me smile, andare provoking me to it every moment.""""How hard it is in some cases to be believed!""""And how impossible in others!""""But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than Iacknowledge?""""That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love toinstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgiveme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."""
Pride & Prejudice,55,"Chapter 55A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. Hisfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home inten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkablygood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with manyexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.""Next time you call,"" said she, ""I hope we shall be more lucky.""He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she wouldgive him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.""Can you come to-morrow?""Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation wasaccepted with alacrity.He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of themdressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressinggown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:""My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley iscome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to MissBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind MissLizzy's hair.""""We will be down as soon as we can,"" said Jane; ""but I dare say Kitty isforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.""""Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!Where is your sash, my dear?""But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go downwithout one of her sisters.The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in theevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was hiscustom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles ofthe five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking atElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making anyimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at lastKitty did, she very innocently said, ""What is the matter mamma? What doyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?""""Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you."" She then sat stillfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, shesuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, ""Come here, my love, I want tospeak to you,"" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a lookat Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and herentreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.Bennet half-opened the door and called out:""Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.""Elizabeth was forced to go.""We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"" said her mother, assoon as she was in the hall. ""Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit inmy dressing-room.""Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remainedquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returnedinto the drawing-room.Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. Hisease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to theirevening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of themother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and commandof countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he wentaway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passedbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed inthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcyreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerablypersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman'sconcurrence.Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spentthe morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much moreagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumptionor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him intosilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than theother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to getevery body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letterto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not bewanted to counteract her mother's schemes.But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, shesaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her motherhad been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived hersister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged inearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces ofboth, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, wouldhave told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ shethought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; andElizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who aswell as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a fewwords to her sister, ran out of the room.Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would givepleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliestemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.""'Tis too much!"" she added, ""by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!why is not everybody as happy?""Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence ofkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would notallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to besaid for the present.""I must go instantly to my mother;"" she cried. ""I would not on anyaccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear itfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, toknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dearfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness!""She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up thecard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and easewith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so manyprevious months of suspense and vexation.""And this,"" said she, ""is the end of all his friend's anxiouscircumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! thehappiest, wisest, most reasonable end!""In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with herfather had been short and to the purpose.""Where is your sister?"" said he hastily, as he opened the door.""With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.""He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishesand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressedher delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands withgreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listento all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all hisexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had forbasis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition ofJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her andhimself.It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction ofMiss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, asmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hopedher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent orspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and whenMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showedhow really happy he was.Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till theirvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, heturned to his daughter, and said:""Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.""Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for hisgoodness.""You are a good girl;"" he replied, ""and I have great pleasure inthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of yourdoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You areeach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; soeasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you willalways exceed your income.""""I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would beunpardonable in me.""""Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,"" cried his wife, ""what are youtalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likelymore."" Then addressing her daughter, ""Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am sohappy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how itwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could notbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, whenhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it wasthat you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man thatever was seen!""Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition herfavourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her youngersisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happinesswhich she might in future be able to dispense.Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kittybegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till aftersupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enoughdetested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himselfobliged to accept.Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; forwhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hoursof separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, healways attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking ofher; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means ofrelief.""He has made me so happy,"" said she, one evening, ""by telling me that hewas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believedit possible.""""I suspected as much,"" replied Elizabeth. ""But how did he account forit?""""It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends tohis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might havechosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they willlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though wecan never be what we once were to each other.""""That is the most unforgiving speech,"" said Elizabeth, ""that I everheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you againthe dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.""""Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ beingindifferent would have prevented his coming down again!""""He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of hismodesty.""This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, andthe little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleasedto find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, sheknew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.""I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"" criedJane. ""Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessedabove them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ butsuch another man for you!""""If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy asyou. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have yourhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have verygood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.""The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long asecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all herneighbours in Meryton.The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in theworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune."
Pride & Prejudice,56,"Chapter 56One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had beenformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in thedining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by thesound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving upthe lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, theequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horseswere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant whopreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, thatsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoidthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into theshrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining threecontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrownopen and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.They were of course all intending to be surprised; but theirastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, eveninferior to what Elizabeth felt.She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made noother reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of thehead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned hername to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request ofintroduction had been made.Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of suchhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sittingfor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,""I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is yourmother.""Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.""And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.""""Yes, madam,"" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.""She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young manwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.""""You have a very small park here,"" returned Lady Catherine after a shortsilence.""It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but Iassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.""""This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, insummer; the windows are full west.""Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and thenadded:""May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. andMrs. Collins well.""""Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.""Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her fromCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But noletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take somerefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,""Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wildernesson one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if youwill favour me with your company.""""Go, my dear,"" cried her mother, ""and show her ladyship about thedifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.""Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through thehall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour anddrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decentlooking rooms, walked on.Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that herwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walkthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort forconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent anddisagreeable.""How could I ever think her like her nephew?"" said she, as she looked inher face.As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the followingmanner:--""You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of myjourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why Icome.""Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.""Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to accountfor the honour of seeing you here.""""Miss Bennet,"" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, ""you ought toknow, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ maychoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever beencelebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of suchmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a mostalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only yoursister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but thatyou, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soonafterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure himso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolvedon setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known toyou.""""If you believed it impossible to be true,"" said Elizabeth, colouringwith astonishment and disdain, ""I wonder you took the trouble of comingso far. What could your ladyship propose by it?""""At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.""""Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,"" said Elizabethcoolly, ""will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a reportis in existence.""""If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not beenindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such areport is spread abroad?""""I never heard that it was.""""And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?""""I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You mayask questions which I shall not choose to answer.""""This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Hashe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?""""Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.""""It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of hisreason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. Youmay have drawn him in.""""If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.""""Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to suchlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.""""But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,ever induce me to be explicit.""""Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have thepresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy isengaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?""""Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he willmake an offer to me.""Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:""The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we plannedthe union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters wouldbe accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman ofinferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied tothe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To histacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling ofpropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliesthours he was destined for his cousin?""""Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there isno other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly notbe kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him tomarry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning themarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neitherby honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to makeanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?""""Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family orfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You willbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentionedby any of us.""""These are heavy misfortunes,"" replied Elizabeth. ""But the wife of Mr.Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarilyattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no causeto repine.""""Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitudefor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on thatscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I camehere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor willI be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person'swhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.""""_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;but it will have no effect on me.""""I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and mynephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternalside, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune onboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice ofevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If youwere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere inwhich you have been brought up.""""In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting thatsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we areequal.""""True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of theircondition.""""Whatever my connections may be,"" said Elizabeth, ""if your nephew doesnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.""""Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?""Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging LadyCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after amoment's deliberation:""I am not.""Lady Catherine seemed pleased.""And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?""""I will make no promise of the kind.""""Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a morereasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief thatI will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me theassurance I require.""""And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated intoanything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marryyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make theirmarriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, wouldmy refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you havesupported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as theapplication was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, ifyou think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far yournephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.""""Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all theobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I amno stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamouselopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was apatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And issuch a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of hislate father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what areyou thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?""""You can now have nothing further to say,"" she resentfully answered.""You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return tothe house.""And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turnedback. Her ladyship was highly incensed.""You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with youmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?""""Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.""""You are then resolved to have him?""""I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, withoutreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.""""It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey theclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him inthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.""""Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,"" replied Elizabeth, ""have anypossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of eitherwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to theresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment'sconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join inthe scorn.""""And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that yourambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find youreasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.""In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door ofthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, ""I take no leaveof you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserveno such attention. I am most seriously displeased.""Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade herladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. Sheheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her motherimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why LadyCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.""She did not choose it,"" said her daughter, ""she would go.""""She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiouslycivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses werewell. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing throughMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she hadnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?""Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for toacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible."
Pride & Prejudice,57,"Chapter 57The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threwElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for manyhours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, itappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the reportof their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when theexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supplythe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of hersister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighboursat Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with theCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), hadonly set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had lookedforward to as possible at some future time.In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not helpfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persistingin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution toprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditatean application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similarrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she darednot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for hisaunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to supposethat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and itwas certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt wouldaddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he wouldprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weakand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had oftenseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation mightsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignityunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. LadyCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement toBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.""If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to hisfriend within a few days,"" she added, ""I shall know how to understandit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of hisconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he mighthave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret himat all.""                          * * * * *The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor hadbeen, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the samekind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; andElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by herfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.""Lizzy,"" said he, ""I was going to look for you; come into my room.""She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had totell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some mannerconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that itmight be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all theconsequent explanations.She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. Hethen said,""I have received a letter this morning that has astonished meexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know itscontents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brinkof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.""The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneousconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explainedhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed toherself; when her father continued:""You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such mattersas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover thename of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.""""From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?""""Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins withcongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, ofwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossipingLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he sayson that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thusoffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself onthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughterElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, afterher elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate maybe reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages inthis land.'""Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? 'This younggentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart ofmortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensivepatronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousinElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitateclosure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will beinclined to take immediate advantage of.'""Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:""'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imaginethat his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match witha friendly eye.'""_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man withinthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the liemore effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at anywoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in hislife! It is admirable!""Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only forceone most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner solittle agreeable to her.""Are you not diverted?""""Oh! yes. Pray read on.""""'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship lastnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what shefelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of somefamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give herconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my dutyto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she andher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not runhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr.Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sadbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that theirliving together before the marriage took place should be so generallyknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrainfrom declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the youngcouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was anencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I shouldvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow theirnames to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christianforgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte'ssituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, youlook as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do welive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in ourturn?""""Oh!"" cried Elizabeth, ""I am excessively diverted. But it is sostrange!""""Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other manit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominatewriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for anyconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help givinghim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence andhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherineabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?""To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it hadbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed byhis repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make herfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when shewould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, bywhat he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing butwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead ofhis seeing too little, she might have fancied too much."
Pride & Prejudice,58,"Chapter 58Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, asElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcywith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine'svisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had timeto tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter satin momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposedtheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in thehabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining fiveset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the othersto outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcywere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kittywas too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming adesperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call uponMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was themoment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage washigh, she immediately said:""Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of givingrelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. Ican no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to mypoor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious toacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the restof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.""""I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,"" replied Darcy, in a tone of surpriseand emotion, ""that you have ever been informed of what may, in amistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardinerwas so little to be trusted.""""You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed tome that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I couldnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which inducedyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for thesake of discovering them.""""If you _will_ thank me,"" he replied, ""let it be for yourself alone.That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the otherinducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thoughtonly of _you_.""Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,her companion added, ""You are too generous to trifle with me. If yourfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silenceme on this subject for ever.""Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety ofhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though notvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergoneso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to makeher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. Thehappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably neverfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and aswarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabethbeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well theexpression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her offeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made hisaffection every moment more valuable.They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much tobe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. Shesoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understandingto the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return throughLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and thesubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically onevery expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief thatsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promisefrom her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for herladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.""It taught me to hope,"" said he, ""as I had scarcely ever allowed myselfto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would haveacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.""Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, ""Yes, you know enoughof my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you soabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to allyour relations.""""What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though youraccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, mybehaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It wasunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.""""We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to thatevening,"" said Elizabeth. ""The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improvedin civility.""""I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what Ithen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole ofit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Yourreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in amore gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you canscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.""""I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong animpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in sucha way.""""I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every properfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall neverforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possibleway that would induce you to accept me.""""Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do atall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.""Darcy mentioned his letter. ""Did it,"" said he, ""did it soon make youthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to itscontents?""She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all herformer prejudices had been removed.""I knew,"" said he, ""that what I wrote must give you pain, but it wasnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one partespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having thepower of reading again. I can remember some expressions which mightjustly make you hate me.""""The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to thepreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think myopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easilychanged as that implies.""""When I wrote that letter,"" replied Darcy, ""I believed myself perfectlycalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in adreadful bitterness of spirit.""""The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. Theadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelingsof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are nowso widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasantcircumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn someof my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives youpleasure.""""I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Yourretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentmentarising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, ofinnocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrudewhich cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfishbeing all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child Iwas taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. Iwas given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoiltby my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, allthat was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taughtme to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own familycircle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at leastto think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such Iwas, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have beenbut for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! Youtaught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a womanworthy of being pleased.""""Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?""""Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to bewishing, expecting my addresses.""""My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assureyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead mewrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?""""Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to takea proper direction.""""I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met atPemberley. You blamed me for coming?""""No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.""""Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and Iconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.""""My object then,"" replied Darcy, ""was to show you, by every civility inmy power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped toobtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting yousee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishesintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half anhour after I had seen you.""He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of herdisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading tothe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution offollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formedbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulnessthere had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose mustcomprehend.She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject toeach, to be dwelt on farther.After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to knowanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, thatit was time to be at home.""What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!"" was a wonder whichintroduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted withtheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information ofit.""I must ask whether you were surprised?"" said Elizabeth.""Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.""""That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much."" Andthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty muchthe case.""On the evening before my going to London,"" said he, ""I made aconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. Itold him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in hisaffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never hadthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myselfmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferentto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her wasunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.""Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing hisfriend.""Did you speak from your own observation,"" said she, ""when you told himthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?""""From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visitswhich I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.""""And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction tohim.""""It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence hadprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, buthis reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confessone thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could notallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three monthslast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He wasangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remainedin any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven menow.""Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightfulfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checkedherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happinessof Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, hecontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall theyparted."
Pride & Prejudice,59,"Chapter 59""My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"" was a questionwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only tosay in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her ownknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anythingelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. Theacknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happythan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be feltin the family when her situation became known; she was aware that noone liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was adislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very farfrom Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.""You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.""""This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; andI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I amin earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we areengaged.""Jane looked at her doubtingly. ""Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how muchyou dislike him.""""You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps Idid not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases asthese, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall everremember it myself.""Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and moreseriously assured her of its truth.""Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"" criedJane. ""My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are youcertain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can behappy with him?""""There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, thatwe are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?""""Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself moredelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do youreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather thanmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you oughtto do?""""Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when Itell you all.""""What do you mean?""""Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I amafraid you will be angry.""""My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Letme know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell mehow long you have loved him?""""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful groundsat Pemberley.""Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced thedesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurancesof attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothingfurther to wish.""Now I am quite happy,"" said she, ""for you will be as happy as myself.I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and yourhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. ButLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did youtell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I knowof it to another, not to you.""Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwillingto mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had madeher equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longerconceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,and half the night spent in conversation.                          * * * * *""Good gracious!"" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the nextmorning, ""if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again withour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be alwayscoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something orother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley'sway.""Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yetwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such anepithet.As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, andshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;and he soon afterwards said aloud, ""Mrs. Bennet, have you no more laneshereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?""""I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""to walkto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy hasnever seen the view.""""It may do very well for the others,"" replied Mr. Bingley; ""but I amsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?"" Kitty owned thatshe had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to seethe view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she wentup stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:""I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have thatdisagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it isall for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talkingto him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself toinconvenience.""During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should beasked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself theapplication for her mother's. She could not determine how her motherwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeurwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether shewere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, itwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do creditto her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hearthe first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of herdisapprobation.                          * * * * *In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she sawMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it wasextreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going tobe made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should befilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretchedreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minuteshe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, whilepretending to admire her work said in a whisper, ""Go to your father, hewants you in the library."" She was gone directly.Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.""Lizzy,"" said he, ""what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to beaccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?""How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been morereasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her fromexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.""Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to besure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.But will they make you happy?""""Have you any other objection,"" said Elizabeth, ""than your belief of myindifference?""""None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; butthis would be nothing if you really liked him.""""I do, I do like him,"" she replied, with tears in her eyes, ""I love him.Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do notknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him insuch terms.""""Lizzy,"" said her father, ""I have given him my consent. He is the kindof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which hecondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved onhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I knowyour disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy norrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you lookedup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in thegreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escapediscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you areabout.""Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; andat length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the objectof her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation ofhim had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affectionwas not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she didconquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.""Well, my dear,"" said he, when she ceased speaking, ""I have no more tosay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted withyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.""To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcyhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.""This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got himhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of troubleand economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ havepaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their ownway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm abouthis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.""He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his readingMr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed herat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, ""If any young men comefor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.""Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, afterhalf an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to jointhe others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent forgaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longeranything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiaritywould come in time.When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable toutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she couldcomprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to creditwhat was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of alover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about inher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.""Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who wouldhave thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how richand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriagesyou will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am sopleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, mydear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. Ihope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thingthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.""This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: andElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,her mother followed her.""My dearest child,"" she cried, ""I can think of nothing else! Tenthousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And aspecial licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. Butmy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,that I may have it to-morrow.""This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentlemanhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certainpossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrowpassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stoodin such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak tohim, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark herdeference for his opinion.Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to getacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was risingevery hour in his esteem.""I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,"" said he. ""Wickham, perhaps,is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as wellas Jane's."""
Pride & Prejudice,60,"Chapter 60Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. ""How couldyou begin?"" said she. ""I can comprehend your going on charmingly, whenyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the firstplace?""""I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, whichlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before Iknew that I _had_ begun.""""My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviourto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoketo you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;did you admire me for my impertinence?""""For the liveliness of your mind, I did.""""You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officiousattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, andinterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been reallyamiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains youtook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; andin your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduouslycourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting forit; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectlyreasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinksof _that_ when they fall in love.""""Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she wasill at Netherfield?""""Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of itby all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you areto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to meto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwillingto come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you firstcalled, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, didyou look as if you did not care about me?""""Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.""""But I was embarrassed.""""And so was I.""""You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.""""A man who had felt less, might.""""How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and thatI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder whenyou _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution ofthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect._Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfortsprings from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned thesubject. This will never do.""""You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. LadyCatherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means ofremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness toyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humourto wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given mehope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.""""Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down toNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?or had you intended any more serious consequence?""""My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether Imight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed tomyself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.""""Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is tobefall her?""""I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But itought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall bedone directly.""""And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you andadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. ButI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.""From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcyhad been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner'slong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew wouldbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle andaunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote asfollows:""I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say thetruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to yourfancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which thesubject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, youcannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him agreat deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Youridea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. Iam the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said sobefore, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; sheonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world thathe can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.Yours, etc.""Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and stilldifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in replyto his last.""DEAR SIR,""I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soonbe the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.""Yours sincerely, etc.""Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approachingmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote evento Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all herformer professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she wasaffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writingher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper wereinsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire ofbeing loved by her sister.Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulationsto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that theCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of thissudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been renderedso exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, thatCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away tillthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friendwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of theirmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when shesaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility ofher husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could evenlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying awaythe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their allmeeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he didshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on hisforbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood intoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's goodhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at alllikely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shieldhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keephim to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might conversewithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arisingfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, itadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight tothe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasingto either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party atPemberley."
Pride & Prejudice,61,"Chapter 61Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet gotrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted prideshe afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, maybe guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that theaccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so manyof her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps itwas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicityin so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous andinvariably silly.Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for herdrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted ingoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So neara vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of hissisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring countyto Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other sourceof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time withher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generallyknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable atemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, lessignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia'ssociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickhamfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise ofballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarilydrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quiteunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, butshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was nolonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change withoutmuch reluctance.As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution fromthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction thatElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitudeand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed onto make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth receivedfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to thiseffect:""MY DEAR LIZZY,""I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dearWickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you sorich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do notthink we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.""Yours, etc.""As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured inher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practiceof what might be called economy in her own private expences, shefrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such anincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant intheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient totheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane orherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistancetowards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when therestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in theextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheapsituation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection forher soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; andin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims toreputation which her marriage had given her.Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, forElizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia wasoccasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himselfin London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequentlystaid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and heproceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as shethought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, shedropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost asattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civilityto Elizabeth.Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisterswas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love eachother even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinionin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened withan astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner oftalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respectwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of openpleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallenin her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend thata woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will notalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character inher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent himlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some timeall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, herresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosityto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to waiton them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods hadreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but thevisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both eversensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringingher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them."
Mansfield Park,0,MANSFIELD PARK(1814)By Jane Austen
Mansfield Park,1,"CHAPTER IAbout thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seventhousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, ofMansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raisedto the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts and consequencesof an handsome house and large income. All Huntingdon exclaimed on thegreatness of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed herto be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it.She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of theiracquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome asMiss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equaladvantage. But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune inthe world as there are pretty women to deserve them. Miss Ward, at theend of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to be attached tothe Rev. Mr. Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely anyprivate fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse. Miss Ward's match,indeed, when it came to the point, was not contemptible: Sir Thomasbeing happily able to give his friend an income in the living ofMansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugalfelicity with very little less than a thousand a year. But Miss Francesmarried, in the common phrase, to disoblige her family, and by fixing ona lieutenant of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions, didit very thoroughly. She could hardly have made a more untoward choice.Sir Thomas Bertram had interest, which, from principle as well aspride--from a general wish of doing right, and a desire of seeing allthat were connected with him in situations of respectability, he wouldhave been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram's sister; buther husband's profession was such as no interest could reach; and beforehe had time to devise any other method of assisting them, an absolutebreach between the sisters had taken place. It was the natural result ofthe conduct of each party, and such as a very imprudent marriage almostalways produces. To save herself from useless remonstrance, Mrs. Pricenever wrote to her family on the subject till actually married. LadyBertram, who was a woman of very tranquil feelings, and a temperremarkably easy and indolent, would have contented herself with merelygiving up her sister, and thinking no more of the matter; but Mrs.Norris had a spirit of activity, which could not be satisfied till shehad written a long and angry letter to Fanny, to point out the folly ofher conduct, and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences.Mrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and angry; and an answer, whichcomprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed such verydisrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norriscould not possibly keep to herself, put an end to all intercoursebetween them for a considerable period.Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved sodistinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of eachother's existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, tomake it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever haveit in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angryvoice, that Fanny had got another child. By the end of eleven years,however, Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride orresentment, or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her.A large and still increasing family, an husband disabled for activeservice, but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a verysmall income to supply their wants, made her eager to regain the friendsshe had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed Lady Bertram ina letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence, such asuperfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything else, ascould not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. She was preparingfor her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance, andimploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, shecould not conceal how important she felt they might be to the futuremaintenance of the eight already in being. Her eldest was a boy of tenyears old, a fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world;but what could she do? Was there any chance of his being hereafteruseful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property?No situation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas think ofWoolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to the East?The letter was not unproductive. It re-established peace and kindness.Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram dispatchedmoney and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a moreimportant advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it. Mrs. Norris wasoften observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister andher family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done for her,she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could not butown it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from thecharge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number. ""Whatif they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter,a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more attention than herpoor mother could possibly give? The trouble and expense of it to themwould be nothing, compared with the benevolence of the action."" LadyBertram agreed with her instantly. ""I think we cannot do better,"" saidshe; ""let us send for the child.""Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent. Hedebated and hesitated;--it was a serious charge;--a girl so brought upmust be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty insteadof kindness in taking her from her family. He thought of his own fourchildren, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;--but no soonerhad he deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norrisinterrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.""My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to thegenerosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of apiece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you inthe main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way ofproviding for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold mymite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should Ilook to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the childrenof my sisters?--and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just--but you know I ama woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be frightened froma good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and introduceher properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means ofsettling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of ours, SirThomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up in thisneighbourhood without many advantages. I don't say she would be sohandsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would beintroduced into the society of this country under such very favourablecircumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditableestablishment. You are thinking of your sons--but do not you know that,of all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, broughtup as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It ismorally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, theonly sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a prettygirl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,and I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having beensuffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect,would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered boys in lovewith her. But breed her up with them from this time, and suppose hereven to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be more toeither than a sister.""""There is a great deal of truth in what you say,"" replied Sir Thomas,""and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of aplan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in,and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable toourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged tosecure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision ofa gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are sosanguine in expecting.""""I thoroughly understand you,"" cried Mrs. Norris, ""you are everythingthat is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagreeon this point. Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always readyenough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I could neverfeel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear yourown dear children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own,I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her. Is not she asister's child? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit ofbread to give her? My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warmheart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries oflife than do an ungenerous thing. So, if you are not against it, I willwrite to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soonas matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield;_you_ shall have no trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I neverregard. I will send Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bedat her cousin the saddler's, and the child be appointed to meet herthere. They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach,under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going. Idare say there is always some reputable tradesman's wife or other goingup.""Except to the attack on Nanny's cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made anyobjection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvousbeing accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. Thedivision of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, tohave been equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real andconsistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not theleast intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.As far as walking, talking, and contriving reached, she was thoroughlybenevolent, and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others;but her love of money was equal to her love of directing, and she knewquite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.Having married on a narrower income than she had been used to lookforward to, she had, from the first, fancied a very strict line ofeconomy necessary; and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon grewinto a matter of choice, as an object of that needful solicitude whichthere were no children to supply. Had there been a family to providefor, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money; but having no careof that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, or lessen thecomfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had neverlived up to. Under this infatuating principle, counteracted by no realaffection for her sister, it was impossible for her to aim at more thanthe credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity; thoughperhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to theParsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief of being themost liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fullyexplained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram's calm inquiry of ""Where shallthe child come to first, sister, to you or to us?"" Sir Thomas heard withsome surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris's power totake any share in the personal charge of her. He had been consideringher as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as a desirablecompanion to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he foundhimself wholly mistaken. Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the littlegirl's staying with them, at least as things then were, was quite out ofthe question. Poor Mr. Norris's indifferent state of health made it animpossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a child than he couldfly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his gouty complaints, itwould be a different matter: she should then be glad to take her turn,and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just now, poor Mr. Norristook up every moment of her time, and the very mention of such a thingshe was sure would distract him.""Then she had better come to us,"" said Lady Bertram, with the utmostcomposure. After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, ""Yes, lether home be in this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her, andshe will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age, andof a regular instructress.""""Very true,"" cried Mrs. Norris, ""which are both very importantconsiderations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she hasthree girls to teach, or only two--there can be no difference. I onlywish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I am notone of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch her,however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor awayfor three days. I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the littlewhite attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best placefor her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close by thehousemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you know, andtake care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not think it fair toexpect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others. Indeed, I do not seethat you could possibly place her anywhere else.""Lady Bertram made no opposition.""I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,"" continued Mrs. Norris,""and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.""""Should her disposition be really bad,"" said Sir Thomas, ""we must not,for our own children's sake, continue her in the family; but there isno reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to wishaltered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, somemeanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; butthese are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous forher associates. Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, I shouldhave considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of veryserious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to fear for_them_, and everything to hope for _her_, from the association.""""That is exactly what I think,"" cried Mrs. Norris, ""and what I wassaying to my husband this morning. It will be an education for thechild, said I, only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught hernothing, she would learn to be good and clever from _them_.""""I hope she will not tease my poor pug,"" said Lady Bertram; ""I have butjust got Julia to leave it alone.""""There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,"" observed SirThomas, ""as to the distinction proper to be made between the girlsas they grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ theconsciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly oftheir cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to makeher remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_. I should wish to see themvery good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls thesmallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still theycannot be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations willalways be different. It is a point of great delicacy, and you mustassist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line ofconduct.""Mrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreedwith him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hopethat between them it would be easily managed.It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her sisterin vain. Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should befixed on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer mostthankfully, assuring them of her daughter's being a very well-disposed,good-humoured girl, and trusting they would never have cause to throwher off. She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny, but wassanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air.Poor woman! she probably thought change of air might agree with many ofher children."
Mansfield Park,2,"CHAPTER IIThe little girl performed her long journey in safety; and at Northamptonwas met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of being foremostto welcome her, and in the importance of leading her in to the others,and recommending her to their kindness.Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there mightnot be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,nothing to disgust her relations. She was small of her age, with no glowof complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid and shy,and shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, was not vulgar,her voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was pretty. SirThomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and Sir Thomas,seeing how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that wasconciliating: but he had to work against a most untoward gravity ofdeportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, orspeaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a good-humouredsmile, became immediately the less awful character of the two.The young people were all at home, and sustained their share in theintroduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, atleast on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tallof their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their littlecousin. The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and ingreater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion withrather an injudicious particularity. But they were too much used tocompany and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and theirconfidence increasing from their cousin's total want of it, they weresoon able to take a full survey of her face and her frock in easyindifference.They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, thedaughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward oftheir age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousinsin person, as education had given to their address; and no one wouldhave supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. Therewere in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. JuliaBertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitormeanwhile was as unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed ofherself, and longing for the home she had left, she knew not how to lookup, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs. Norrishad been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her wonderfulgood fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and goodbehaviour which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of misery wastherefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for hernot to be happy. The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became soon notrifling evil. In vain were the well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas,and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would bea good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofawith herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tarttowards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfulsbefore tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her likeliestfriend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.""This is not a very promising beginning,"" said Mrs. Norris, when Fannyhad left the room. ""After all that I said to her as we came along, Ithought she would have behaved better; I told her how much might dependupon her acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be alittle sulkiness of temper--her poor mother had a good deal; but we mustmake allowances for such a child--and I do not know that her being sorryto leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults,it _was_ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she haschanged for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.""It required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined toallow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and theseparation from everybody she had been used to. Her feelings were veryacute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. Nobodymeant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to secureher comfort.The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day, on purpose toafford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their youngcousin, produced little union. They could not but hold her cheap onfinding that she had but two sashes, and had never learned French; andwhen they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were sogood as to play, they could do no more than make her a generous presentof some of their least valued toys, and leave her to herself, whilethey adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of themoment, making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.Fanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in the schoolroom, thedrawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding somethingto fear in every person and place. She was disheartened by LadyBertram's silence, awed by Sir Thomas's grave looks, and quite overcomeby Mrs. Norris's admonitions. Her elder cousins mortified her byreflections on her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: MissLee wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at herclothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothersand sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow,instructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her little heart wassevere.The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her. Therooms were too large for her to move in with ease: whatever she touchedshe expected to injure, and she crept about in constant terror ofsomething or other; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry; andthe little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left itat night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune,ended every day's sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. A week hadpassed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quietpassive manner, when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund, theyoungest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.""My dear little cousin,"" said he, with all the gentleness of anexcellent nature, ""what can be the matter?"" And sitting down by her,he was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised, andpersuade her to speak openly. Was she ill? or was anybody angry withher? or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzledabout anything in her lesson that he could explain? Did she, in short,want anything he could possibly get her, or do for her? For a long whileno answer could be obtained beyond a ""no, no--not at all--no, thankyou""; but he still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to revertto her own home, than her increased sobs explained to him where thegrievance lay. He tried to console her.""You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,"" said he, ""whichshows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you arewith relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make youhappy. Let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about yourbrothers and sisters.""On pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all these brothers andsisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in herthoughts than the rest. It was William whom she talked of most, andwanted most to see. William, the eldest, a year older than herself, herconstant companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whomhe was the darling) in every distress. ""William did not like she shouldcome away; he had told her he should miss her very much indeed."" ""ButWilliam will write to you, I dare say."" ""Yes, he had promised he would,but he had told _her_ to write first."" ""And when shall you do it?"" Shehung her head and answered hesitatingly, ""she did not know; she had notany paper.""""If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper and everyother material, and you may write your letter whenever you choose. Wouldit make you happy to write to William?""""Yes, very.""""Then let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we shallfind everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves.""""But, cousin, will it go to the post?""""Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and,as your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.""""My uncle!"" repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.""Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father tofrank.""Fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; andthey went together into the breakfast-room, where Edmund prepared herpaper, and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brothercould himself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. Hecontinued with her the whole time of her writing, to assist her with hispenknife or his orthography, as either were wanted; and added to theseattentions, which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother whichdelighted her beyond all the rest. He wrote with his own hand hislove to his cousin William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal.Fanny's feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herselfincapable of expressing; but her countenance and a few artless wordsfully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin beganto find her an interesting object. He talked to her more, and, from allthat she said, was convinced of her having an affectionate heart, anda strong desire of doing right; and he could perceive her to be fartherentitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation, and greattimidity. He had never knowingly given her pain, but he now felt thatshe required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured,in the first place, to lessen her fears of them all, and gave herespecially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria andJulia, and being as merry as possible.From this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She felt that she had afriend, and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spiritswith everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people lessformidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not ceaseto fear, she began at least to know their ways, and to catch the bestmanner of conforming to them. The little rusticities and awkwardnesseswhich had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all,and not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she was no longermaterially afraid to appear before her uncle, nor did her aunt Norris'svoice make her start very much. To her cousins she became occasionallyan acceptable companion. Though unworthy, from inferiority of age andstrength, to be their constant associate, their pleasures and schemeswere sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful, especially whenthat third was of an obliging, yielding temper; and they could not butown, when their aunt inquired into her faults, or their brother Edmundurged her claims to their kindness, that ""Fanny was good-naturedenough.""Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endureon the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man ofseventeen will always think fair with a child of ten. He was justentering into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberaldispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only for expense andenjoyment. His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with hissituation and rights: he made her some very pretty presents, and laughedat her.As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norristhought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and itwas pretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, sheshowed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them littletrouble. A mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_.Fanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught nothing more;and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they hadbeen long familiar, they thought her prodigiously stupid, and for thefirst two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report ofit into the drawing-room. ""Dear mama, only think, my cousin cannotput the map of Europe together--or my cousin cannot tell the principalrivers in Russia--or, she never heard of Asia Minor--or she doesnot know the difference between water-colours and crayons!--Howstrange!--Did you ever hear anything so stupid?""""My dear,"" their considerate aunt would reply, ""it is very bad, butyou must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning asyourself.""""But, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!--Do you know, we asked herlast night which way she would go to get to Ireland; and she said, sheshould cross to the Isle of Wight. She thinks of nothing but the Isle ofWight, and she calls it _the_ _Island_, as if there were no other islandin the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, if I hadnot known better long before I was so old as she is. I cannot rememberthe time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the leastnotion of yet. How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat thechronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of theiraccession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!""""Yes,"" added the other; ""and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus;besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers.""""Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderfulmemories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is avast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else,and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity herdeficiency. And remember that, if you are ever so forward and cleveryourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already,there is a great deal more for you to learn.""""Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you anotherthing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says she does notwant to learn either music or drawing.""""To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a greatwant of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not knowwhether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up withyou, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished asyou are;--on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there shouldbe a difference.""Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her nieces'minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their promisingtalents and early information, they should be entirely deficient in theless common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity and humility. Ineverything but disposition they were admirably taught. Sir Thomas didnot know what was wanting, because, though a truly anxious father, hewas not outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of his manner repressedall the flow of their spirits before him.To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallestattention. She had not time for such cares. She was a woman who spenther days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece ofneedlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pug thanher children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not putherself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas,and in smaller concerns by her sister. Had she possessed greater leisurefor the service of her girls, she would probably have supposed itunnecessary, for they were under the care of a governess, with propermasters, and could want nothing more. As for Fanny's being stupid atlearning, ""she could only say it was very unlucky, but some people_were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she did not know whatelse was to be done; and, except her being so dull, she must add she sawno harm in the poor little thing, and always found her very handy andquick in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted.""Fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed atMansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of herattachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among hercousins. There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and thoughFanny was often mortified by their treatment of her, she thought toolowly of her own claims to feel injured by it.From about the time of her entering the family, Lady Bertram, inconsequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gaveup the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring,and remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend hisduty in Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfortmight arise from her absence. In the country, therefore, the MissBertrams continued to exercise their memories, practise their duets,and grow tall and womanly: and their father saw them becoming in person,manner, and accomplishments, everything that could satisfy his anxiety.His eldest son was careless and extravagant, and had already given himmuch uneasiness; but his other children promised him nothing but good.His daughters, he felt, while they retained the name of Bertram, mustbe giving it new grace, and in quitting it, he trusted, would extendits respectable alliances; and the character of Edmund, his strong goodsense and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for utility, honour, andhappiness to himself and all his connexions. He was to be a clergyman.Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested,Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs.Price: he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of hersons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny,though almost totally separated from her family, was sensible of thetruest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or ofanything at all promising in their situation or conduct. Once, and onceonly, in the course of many years, had she the happiness of being withWilliam. Of the rest she saw nothing: nobody seemed to think of her evergoing amongst them again, even for a visit, nobody at home seemed towant her; but William determining, soon after her removal, to be asailor, was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshirebefore he went to sea. Their eager affection in meeting, their exquisitedelight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, and moments ofserious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguine views andspirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of the girl when heleft her. Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays, when shecould directly look for comfort to her cousin Edmund; and he told hersuch charming things of what William was to do, and be hereafter, inconsequence of his profession, as made her gradually admit that theseparation might have some use. Edmund's friendship never failed her:his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind dispositions, andonly afforded more frequent opportunities of proving them. Without anydisplay of doing more than the rest, or any fear of doing too much,he was always true to her interests, and considerate of her feelings,trying to make her good qualities understood, and to conquer thediffidence which prevented their being more apparent; giving her advice,consolation, and encouragement.Kept back as she was by everybody else, his single support could notbring her forward; but his attentions were otherwise of the highestimportance in assisting the improvement of her mind, and extending itspleasures. He knew her to be clever, to have a quick apprehensionas well as good sense, and a fondness for reading, which, properlydirected, must be an education in itself. Miss Lee taught her French,and heard her read the daily portion of history; but he recommendedthe books which charmed her leisure hours, he encouraged her taste, andcorrected her judgment: he made reading useful by talking to her of whatshe read, and heightened its attraction by judicious praise. In returnfor such services she loved him better than anybody in the world exceptWilliam: her heart was divided between the two."
Mansfield Park,3,"CHAPTER IIIThe first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.Norris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarilyintroduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris, on quitting theParsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small houseof Sir Thomas's in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of herhusband by considering that she could do very well without him; and forher reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy.The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle died a few yearssooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till hewere old enough for orders. But Tom's extravagance had, previous tothat event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the nextpresentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for thepleasures of the elder. There was another family living actually heldfor Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangementsomewhat easier to Sir Thomas's conscience, he could not but feel it tobe an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest sonwith the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better effectthan anything he had yet been able to say or do.""I blush for you, Tom,"" said he, in his most dignified manner; ""I blushfor the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity yourfeelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten,twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the incomewhich ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours(I hope it will), to procure him better preferment; but it must notbe forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond hisnatural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalentfor the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through theurgency of your debts.""Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quickly aspossible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly, that hehad not been half so much in debt as some of his friends; secondly, thathis father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it; and,thirdly, that the future incumbent, whoever he might be, would, in allprobability, die very soon.On Mr. Norris's death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant,who came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be ahearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram'scalculations. But ""no, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of fellow,and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off.""He had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children; andthey entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being veryrespectable, agreeable people.The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law toclaim her share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris's situation,and the improvement in Fanny's age, seeming not merely to do away anyformer objection to their living together, but even to give it the mostdecided eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered lessfair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate, inaddition to his eldest son's extravagance, it became not undesirableto himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and theobligation of her future provision. In the fullness of his belief thatsuch a thing must be, he mentioned its probability to his wife; and thefirst time of the subject's occurring to her again happening to be whenFanny was present, she calmly observed to her, ""So, Fanny, you are goingto leave us, and live with my sister. How shall you like it?""Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt's words,""Going to leave you?""""Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five yearswith us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died.But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.""The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected. She hadnever received kindness from her aunt Norris, and could not love her.""I shall be very sorry to go away,"" said she, with a faltering voice.""Yes, I dare say you will; _that's_ natural enough. I suppose you havehad as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creaturein the world.""""I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,"" said Fanny modestly.""No, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you a very good girl.""""And am I never to live here again?""""Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can makevery little difference to you, whether you are in one house or theother.""Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel thedifference to be so small, she could not think of living with her auntwith anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she toldhim her distress.""Cousin,"" said she, ""something is going to happen which I do not likeat all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled tothings that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. I amgoing to live entirely with my aunt Norris.""""Indeed!""""Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is quite settled. I am toleave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon asshe is removed there.""""Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should callit an excellent one.""""Oh, cousin!""""It has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a sensiblewoman in wishing for you. She is choosing a friend and companion exactlywhere she ought, and I am glad her love of money does not interfere.You will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does not distress youvery much, Fanny?""""Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything init: I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel withher.""""I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was thesame with us all, or nearly so. She never knew how to be pleasant tochildren. But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she isbehaving better already; and when you are her only companion, you _must_be important to her.""""I can never be important to any one.""""What is to prevent you?""""Everything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.""""As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, younever have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.There is no reason in the world why you should not be important whereyou are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sureyou have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness withoutwishing to return it. I do not know any better qualifications for afriend and companion.""""You are too kind,"" said Fanny, colouring at such praise; ""how shall Iever thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me. Oh! cousin, if Iam to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of mylife.""""Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distanceas the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred milesoff instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almostas much as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in theyear. The only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you willnecessarily be brought forward as you ought to be. _Here_ there aretoo many whom you can hide behind; but with _her_ you will be forced tospeak for yourself.""""Oh! I do not say so.""""I must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much betterfitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. She is of atemper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herselfabout, and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers.""Fanny sighed, and said, ""I cannot see things as you do; but I ought tobelieve you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obligedto you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could supposemy aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself ofconsequence to anybody. _Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I love theplace so well.""""The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the house.You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever. Even_your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominalchange. You will have the same walks to frequent, the same library tochoose from, the same people to look at, the same horse to ride.""""Very true. Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember howmuch I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talkedof as likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle'sopening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kindpains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convinceme that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right youproved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.""""And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be asgood for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much foryour ultimate happiness too.""So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service itcould render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris hadnot the smallest intention of taking her. It had never occurred to her,on the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. Toprevent its being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitationwhich could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish,the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and herservants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she made avery particular point. The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never beenwanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was nownever forgotten. Not all her precautions, however, could save her frombeing suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display ofthe importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to supposeit really intended for Fanny. Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to acertainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris--""I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goesto live with you.""Mrs. Norris almost started. ""Live with me, dear Lady Bertram! what doyou mean?""""Is she not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with SirThomas.""""Me! never. I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he tome. Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to thinkof, or for anybody to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven! whatcould I do with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit foranything, my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl ather time of life? A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to needmost attention and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test!Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas istoo much my friend. Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, would proposeit. How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it?""""Indeed, I do not know. I suppose he thought it best.""""But what did he say? He could not say he _wished_ me to take Fanny. Iam sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.""""No; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought so too. Weboth thought it would be a comfort to you. But if you do not like it,there is no more to be said. She is no encumbrance here.""""Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she be anycomfort to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best ofhusbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits stillworse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough tosupport me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as notto disgrace the memory of the dear departed--what possible comfort couldI have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wish it formy own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl. Sheis in good hands, and sure of doing well. I must struggle through mysorrows and difficulties as I can.""""Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?""""Lady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot live as I have done,but I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager. I_have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamedto practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income.A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of theparish, that cannot be expected from me. It is unknown how much wasconsumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the White House,matters must be better looked after. I _must_ live within my income, orI shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction tobe able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year.""""I dare say you will. You always do, don't you?""""My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me.It is for your children's good that I wish to be richer. I have nobodyelse to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave alittle trifle among them worth their having.""""You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. They aresure of being well provided for. Sir Thomas will take care of that.""""Why, you know, Sir Thomas's means will be rather straitened if theAntigua estate is to make such poor returns.""""Oh! _that_ will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been writing about it,I know.""""Well, Lady Bertram,"" said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, ""I can only saythat my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if SirThomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be ableto say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;besides that, I really should not have a bed to give her, for I mustkeep a spare room for a friend.""Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband toconvince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law's views; andshe was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or theslightest allusion to it from him. He could not but wonder at herrefusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward toadopt; but, as she took early care to make him, as well as Lady Bertram,understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family,he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the same time that itwas advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable him better toprovide for Fanny himself.Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal;and her spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed someconsolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected tobe so essentially serviceable to her. Mrs. Norris took possession of theWhite House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events over,everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gave greatsatisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance. They had theirfaults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out. The Doctor was very fond ofeating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, insteadof contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as highwages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen in heroffices. Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances,nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumedin the house. ""Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself;nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she believed, had neverbeen wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad characterin _her_ _time_, but this was a way of going on that she could notunderstand. A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place._Her_ store-room, she thought, might have been good enough for Mrs.Grant to go into. Inquire where she would, she could not find out thatMrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds.""Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective.She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she felt allthe injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant's being so well settled in lifewithout being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that pointalmost as often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed theother.These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another eventarose of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim some placein the thoughts and conversation of the ladies. Sir Thomas found itexpedient to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement of hisaffairs, and he took his eldest son with him, in the hope of detachinghim from some bad connexions at home. They left England with theprobability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent.The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of itsutility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting therest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction ofothers at their present most interesting time of life. He could notthink Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or rather,to perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris's watchfulattention, and in Edmund's judgment, he had sufficient confidence tomake him go without fears for their conduct.Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her; but shewas not disturbed by any alarm for his safety, or solicitude for hiscomfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous,or difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for theirsorrow, but for their want of it. Their father was no object of love tothem; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his absencewas unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all restraint;and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have beenforbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at theirown disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach. Fanny'srelief, and her consciousness of it, were quite equal to her cousins';but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful,and she really grieved because she could not grieve. ""Sir Thomas, whohad done so much for her and her brothers, and who was gone perhapsnever to return! that she should see him go without a tear! it was ashameful insensibility."" He had said to her, moreover, on the very lastmorning, that he hoped she might see William again in the course of theensuing winter, and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfieldas soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to bein England. ""This was so thoughtful and kind!"" and would he only havesmiled upon her, and called her ""my dear Fanny,"" while he said it, everyformer frown or cold address might have been forgotten. But he had endedhis speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification, by adding, ""IfWilliam does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able to convince himthat the many years which have passed since you parted have not beenspent on your side entirely without improvement; though, I fear, he mustfind his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister atten."" She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle wasgone; and her cousins, on seeing her with red eyes, set her down as ahypocrite."
Mansfield Park,4,"CHAPTER IVTom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that hecould be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonishedto find how very well they did even without his father, how well Edmundcould supply his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing tothe attorney, settling with the servants, and equally saving herfrom all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that ofdirecting her letters.The earliest intelligence of the travellers' safe arrival at Antigua,after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norrishad been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmundparticipate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she dependedon being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,when Sir Thomas's assurances of their both being alive and well made itnecessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speechesfor a while.The winter came and passed without their being called for; the accountscontinued perfectly good; and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for hernieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,and looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, inaddition to all her own household cares, some interference in those ofher sister, and Mrs. Grant's wasteful doings to overlook, left her verylittle occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of theneighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirementsa manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility andobligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration. Theirvanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it,and gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending such behaviour,secured and brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them inbelieving they had no faults.Lady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters. She was tooindolent even to accept a mother's gratification in witnessing theirsuccess and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble, and thecharge was made over to her sister, who desired nothing better than apost of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly relishedthe means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses tohire.Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyedbeing avowedly useful as her aunt's companion when they called away therest of the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturallybecame everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party.She talked to her, listened to her, read to her; and the tranquillityof such evenings, her perfect security in such a _tete-a-tete_ from anysound of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldomknown a pause in its alarms or embarrassments. As to her cousins'gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them, especially of theballs, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought too lowly of herown situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same, andlistened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them. Uponthe whole, it was a comfortable winter to her; for though it broughtno William to England, the never-failing hope of his arrival was worthmuch.The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend, the old grey pony;and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health aswell as in her affections; for in spite of the acknowledged importanceof her riding on horse-back, no measures were taken for mounting heragain, ""because,"" as it was observed by her aunts, ""she might ride oneof her cousin's horses at any time when they did not want them,"" and asthe Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day, and hadno idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any realpleasure, that time, of course, never came. They took their cheerfulrides in the fine mornings of April and May; and Fanny either sat athome the whole day with one aunt, or walked beyond her strength atthe instigation of the other: Lady Bertram holding exercise to be asunnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant to herself; and Mrs.Norris, who was walking all day, thinking everybody ought to walkas much. Edmund was absent at this time, or the evil would havebeen earlier remedied. When he returned, to understand how Fanny wassituated, and perceived its ill effects, there seemed with him but onething to be done; and that ""Fanny must have a horse"" was the resolutedeclaration with which he opposed whatever could be urged by thesupineness of his mother, or the economy of his aunt, to make it appearunimportant. Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady oldthing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park that woulddo vastly well; or that one might be borrowed of the steward; or thatperhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to thepost. She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary, and evenimproper, that Fanny should have a regular lady's horse of her own, inthe style of her cousins. She was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it:and she must say that, to be making such a purchase in his absence, andadding to the great expenses of his stable, at a time when a large partof his income was unsettled, seemed to her very unjustifiable. ""Fannymust have a horse,"" was Edmund's only reply. Mrs. Norris could not seeit in the same light. Lady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her sonas to the necessity of it, and as to its being considered necessary byhis father; she only pleaded against there being any hurry; she onlywanted him to wait till Sir Thomas's return, and then Sir Thomas mightsettle it all himself. He would be at home in September, and where wouldbe the harm of only waiting till September?Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with hismother, as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help payingmore attention to what she said; and at length determined on a method ofproceeding which would obviate the risk of his father's thinking hehad done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediatemeans of exercise, which he could not bear she should be without. He hadthree horses of his own, but not one that would carry a woman. Twoof them were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third heresolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride; he knew wheresuch a one was to be met with; and having once made up his mind, thewhole business was soon completed. The new mare proved a treasure; witha very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose,and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her. She had notsupposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old greypony; but her delight in Edmund's mare was far beyond any formerpleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in theconsideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, wasbeyond all her words to express. She regarded her cousin as an exampleof everything good and great, as possessing worth which no one butherself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude fromher as no feelings could be strong enough to pay. Her sentiments towardshim were compounded of all that was respectful, grateful, confiding, andtender.As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of Edmund,Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny's use; and had LadyBertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might havebeen excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas's return inSeptember, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, andwithout any near prospect of finishing his business. Unfavourablecircumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning toturn all his thoughts towards England; and the very great uncertaintyin which everything was then involved determined him on sending home hisson, and waiting the final arrangement by himself. Tom arrived safely,bringing an excellent account of his father's health; but to very littlepurpose, as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned. Sir Thomas's sending awayhis son seemed to her so like a parent's care, under the influence of aforeboding of evil to himself, that she could not help feeling dreadfulpresentiments; and as the long evenings of autumn came on, was soterribly haunted by these ideas, in the sad solitariness of her cottage,as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining-room of the Park.The return of winter engagements, however, was not without its effect;and in the course of their progress, her mind became so pleasantlyoccupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest niece, astolerably to quiet her nerves. ""If poor Sir Thomas were fated never toreturn, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria wellmarried,"" she very often thought; always when they were in the companyof men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a young manwho had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finestplaces in the country.Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram,and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love. He wasa heavy young man, with not more than common sense; but as there wasnothing disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady was wellpleased with her conquest. Being now in her twenty-first year, MariaBertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage withMr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than herfather's, as well as ensure her the house in town, which was now a primeobject, it became, by the same rule of moral obligation, her evidentduty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could. Mrs. Norris was most zealousin promoting the match, by every suggestion and contrivance likely toenhance its desirableness to either party; and, among other means, byseeking an intimacy with the gentleman's mother, who at present livedwith him, and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through tenmiles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit. It was not long beforea good understanding took place between this lady and herself. Mrs.Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry,and declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen, MissBertram seemed, by her amiable qualities and accomplishments, the bestadapted to make him happy. Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment,and admired the nice discernment of character which could so welldistinguish merit. Maria was indeed the pride and delight of themall--perfectly faultless--an angel; and, of course, so surrounded byadmirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, as far as Mrs.Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance, Mr.Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her.After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the youngpeople justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due referenceto the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfactionof their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of theneighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of Mr.Rushworth's marrying Miss Bertram.It was some months before Sir Thomas's consent could be received; but,in the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasurein the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carriedon without restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs.Norris's talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of atpresent.Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in thebusiness; but no representation of his aunt's could induce him to findMr. Rushworth a desirable companion. He could allow his sister to bethe best judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that herhappiness should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain fromoften saying to himself, in Mr. Rushworth's company--""If this man hadnot twelve thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow.""Sir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an allianceso unquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but theperfectly good and agreeable. It was a connexion exactly of the rightsort--in the same county, and the same interest--and his most heartyconcurrence was conveyed as soon as possible. He only conditioned thatthe marriage should not take place before his return, which he was againlooking eagerly forward to. He wrote in April, and had strong hopesof settling everything to his entire satisfaction, and leaving Antiguabefore the end of the summer.Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had justreached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village receivedan addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and MissCrawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage. They wereyoung people of fortune. The son had a good estate in Norfolk, thedaughter twenty thousand pounds. As children, their sister had beenalways very fond of them; but, as her own marriage had been soonfollowed by the death of their common parent, which left them to thecare of a brother of their father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, shehad scarcely seen them since. In their uncle's house they had found akind home. Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,were united in affection for these children, or, at least, were nofarther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite, towhom they showed the greatest fondness of the two. The Admiral delightedin the boy, Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl; and it was the lady's deathwhich now obliged her _protegee_, after some months' further trial ather uncle's house, to find another home. Admiral Crawford was a man ofvicious conduct, who chose, instead of retaining his niece, to bring hismistress under his own roof; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for hersister's proposal of coming to her, a measure quite as welcome on oneside as it could be expedient on the other; for Mrs. Grant, having bythis time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in thecountry without a family of children--having more than filled herfavourite sitting-room with pretty furniture, and made a choicecollection of plants and poultry--was very much in want of some varietyat home. The arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she had always loved,and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained single, washighly agreeable; and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should notsatisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to London.Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, thoughthey arose principally from doubts of her sister's style of living andtone of society; and it was not till after she had tried in vain topersuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house,that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations. Toanything like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, HenryCrawford had, unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate hissister in an article of such importance; but he escorted her, with theutmost kindness, into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetchher away again, at half an hour's notice, whenever she were weary of theplace.The meeting was very satisfactory on each side. Miss Crawford found asister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister's husband who lookedthe gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grantreceived in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young manand woman of very prepossessing appearance. Mary Crawford was remarkablypretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance; the mannersof both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave themcredit for everything else. She was delighted with each, but Mary washer dearest object; and having never been able to glory in beauty of herown, she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister's.She had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her:she had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest son of a baronet was not toogood for a girl of twenty thousand pounds, with all the eleganceand accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her; and being awarm-hearted, unreserved woman, Mary had not been three hours in thehouse before she told her what she had planned.Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very nearthem, and not at all displeased either at her sister's early care, orthe choice it had fallen on. Matrimony was her object, provided shecould marry well: and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew thatobjection could no more be made to his person than to his situation inlife. While she treated it as a joke, therefore, she did not forget tothink of it seriously. The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.""And now,"" added Mrs. Grant, ""I have thought of something to make itcomplete. I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; andtherefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice,handsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you veryhappy.""Henry bowed and thanked her.""My dear sister,"" said Mary, ""if you can persuade him into anythingof the sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myselfallied to anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you havenot half a dozen daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade Henryto marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman. All that Englishabilities can do has been tried already. I have three very particularfriends who have been all dying for him in their turn; and the painswhich they, their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear auntand myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick him into marrying, isinconceivable! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined. Ifyour Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke, let themavoid Henry.""""My dear brother, I will not believe this of you.""""No, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder than Mary. Youwill allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. I am of a cautioustemper, and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry. Nobody canthink more highly of the matrimonial state than myself. I consider theblessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines ofthe poet--'Heaven's _last_ best gift.'""""There, Mrs. Grant, you see how he dwells on one word, and only lookat his smile. I assure you he is very detestable; the Admiral's lessonshave quite spoiled him.""""I pay very little regard,"" said Mrs. Grant, ""to what any young personsays on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination forit, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.""Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling nodisinclination to the state herself.""Oh yes! I am not at all ashamed of it. I would have everybody marry ifthey can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselvesaway; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it toadvantage."""
Mansfield Park,5,"CHAPTER VThe young people were pleased with each other from the first. On eachside there was much to attract, and their acquaintance soon promised asearly an intimacy as good manners would warrant. Miss Crawford's beautydid her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams. They were too handsomethemselves to dislike any woman for being so too, and were almost asmuch charmed as their brothers with her lively dark eye, clear browncomplexion, and general prettiness. Had she been tall, full formed, andfair, it might have been more of a trial: but as it was, there could beno comparison; and she was most allowably a sweet, pretty girl, whilethey were the finest young women in the country.Her brother was not handsome: no, when they first saw him he wasabsolutely plain, black and plain; but still he was the gentleman, witha pleasing address. The second meeting proved him not so very plain:he was plain, to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and histeeth were so good, and he was so well made, that one soon forgot he wasplain; and after a third interview, after dining in company with him atthe Parsonage, he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody. Hewas, in fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known,and they were equally delighted with him. Miss Bertram's engagement madehim in equity the property of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; andbefore he had been at Mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallenin love with.Maria's notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct. Shedid not want to see or understand. ""There could be no harm in her likingan agreeable man--everybody knew her situation--Mr. Crawford must takecare of himself."" Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger! theMiss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready to be pleased; and hebegan with no object but of making them like him. He did not want themto die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have made himjudge and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude on such points.""I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister,"" said he, as he returnedfrom attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit; ""theyare very elegant, agreeable girls.""""So they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it. But you likeJulia best.""""Oh yes! I like Julia best.""""But do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought thehandsomest.""""So I should suppose. She has the advantage in every feature, and Iprefer her countenance; but I like Julia best; Miss Bertram is certainlythe handsomest, and I have found her the most agreeable, but I shallalways like Julia best, because you order me.""""I shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you _will_ like her best atlast.""""Do not I tell you that I like her best _at_ _first_?""""And besides, Miss Bertram is engaged. Remember that, my dear brother.Her choice is made.""""Yes, and I like her the better for it. An engaged woman is always moreagreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her caresare over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasingwithout suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can bedone.""""Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and itis a great match for her.""""But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; _that_ is youropinion of your intimate friend. _I_ do not subscribe to it. I am sureMiss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth. I could see it inher eyes, when he was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram tosuppose she would ever give her hand without her heart.""""Mary, how shall we manage him?""""We must leave him to himself, I believe. Talking does no good. He willbe taken in at last.""""But I would not have him _taken_ _in_; I would not have him duped; Iwould have it all fair and honourable.""""Oh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in. It will do just aswell. Everybody is taken in at some period or other.""""Not always in marriage, dear Mary.""""In marriage especially. With all due respect to such of the presentcompany as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one ina hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry. Look whereI will, I see that it _is_ so; and I feel that it _must_ be so, when Iconsider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people expectmost from others, and are least honest themselves.""""Ah! You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.""""My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but,however, speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business.I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidenceof some one particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, orgood quality in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived,and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse. What is this but atake in?""""My dear child, there must be a little imagination here. I beg yourpardon, but I cannot quite believe you. Depend upon it, you see buthalf. You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. There willbe little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt toexpect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, humannature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we makea second better: we find comfort somewhere--and those evil-mindedobservers, dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken inand deceived than the parties themselves.""""Well done, sister! I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_. When I am awife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my friends ingeneral would be so too. It would save me many a heartache.""""You are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure you both.Mansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in. Stay with us,and we will cure you.""The Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay.Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henryequally ready to lengthen his visit. He had come, intending to spendonly a few days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there wasnothing to call him elsewhere. It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them bothwith her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: atalking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant societyto an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford's being his guest wasan excuse for drinking claret every day.The Miss Bertrams' admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous thananything which Miss Crawford's habits made her likely to feel. Sheacknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men,that two such young men were not often seen together even in London, andthat their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good._He_ had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry thanEdmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being theeldest was another strong claim. She had felt an early presentiment thatshe _should_ like the eldest best. She knew it was her way.Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he wasthe sort of young man to be generally liked, his agreeableness was ofthe kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higherstamp, for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance,and a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park, and abaronetcy, did no harm to all this. Miss Crawford soon felt that he andhis situation might do. She looked about her with due consideration, andfound almost everything in his favour: a park, a real park, five milesround, a spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well screenedas to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen'sseats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be completely newfurnished--pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an agreeable manhimself--with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at presentby a promise to his father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter. Itmight do very well; she believed she should accept him; and she beganaccordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had torun at the B---- races.These races were to call him away not long after their acquaintancebegan; and as it appeared that the family did not, from his usual goingson, expect him back again for many weeks, it would bring his passion toan early proof. Much was said on his side to induce her to attend theraces, and schemes were made for a large party to them, with all theeagerness of inclination, but it would only do to be talked of.And Fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while? and whatwas _her_ opinion of the newcomers? Few young ladies of eighteen couldbe less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny. In a quiet way,very little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to MissCrawford's beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawfordvery plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved thecontrary, she never mentioned _him_. The notice, which she excitedherself, was to this effect. ""I begin now to understand you all,except Miss Price,"" said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr.Bertrams. ""Pray, is she out, or is she not? I am puzzled. She dined atthe Parsonage, with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_; andyet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose she _is_.""Edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, ""I believe I knowwhat you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. Mycousin is grown up. She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outsand not outs are beyond me.""""And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. Thedistinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generallyspeaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed itpossible to be mistaken as to a girl's being out or not. A girl not outhas always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looksvery demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, Iassure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,it is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The mostobjectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on beingintroduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass insuch very little time from reserve to quite the opposite--to confidence!_That_ is the faulty part of the present system. One does not like tosee a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing--andperhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before. Mr.Bertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with such changes.""""I believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you are at. Youare quizzing me and Miss Anderson.""""No, indeed. Miss Anderson! I do not know who or what you mean. I amquite in the dark. But I _will_ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure,if you will tell me what about.""""Ah! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite so far imposedon. You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye, in describing analtered young lady. You paint too accurately for mistake. It was exactlyso. The Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of them the otherday, you know. Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles Anderson.The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it. WhenAnderson first introduced me to his family, about two years ago, hissister was not _out_, and I could not get her to speak to me. I satthere an hour one morning waiting for Anderson, with only her and alittle girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away,and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and Icould hardly get a word or a look from the young lady--nothing like acivil answer--she screwed up her mouth, and turned from me with such anair! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth. She was then _out_. Imet her at Mrs. Holford's, and did not recollect her. She came up to me,claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and talkedand laughed till I did not know which way to look. I felt that I mustbe the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain, hasheard the story.""""And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say,than does credit to Miss Anderson. It is too common a fault. Motherscertainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing theirdaughters. I do not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to setpeople right, but I do see that they are often wrong.""""Those who are showing the world what female manners _should_ be,"" saidMr. Bertram gallantly, ""are doing a great deal to set them right.""""The error is plain enough,"" said the less courteous Edmund; ""such girlsare ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the beginning.They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no morereal modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public thanafterwards.""""I do not know,"" replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly. ""Yes, I cannotagree with you there. It is certainly the modestest part of thebusiness. It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves thesame airs and take the same liberties as if they were, which I have seendone. That is worse than anything--quite disgusting!""""Yes, _that_ is very inconvenient indeed,"" said Mr. Bertram. ""It leadsone astray; one does not know what to do. The close bonnet and demureair you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one whatis expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want ofthem. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September,just after my return from the West Indies. My friend Sneyd--you haveheard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund--his father, and mother, and sisters,were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place they were out;we went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and the two MissSneyds, with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow in form; andas Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to one of herdaughters, walked by her side all the way home, and made myself asagreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners, andas ready to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that I could bedoing anything wrong. They looked just the same: both well-dressed, withveils and parasols like other girls; but I afterwards found that I hadbeen giving all my attention to the youngest, who was not _out_, andhad most excessively offended the eldest. Miss Augusta ought not to havebeen noticed for the next six months; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, hasnever forgiven me.""""That was bad indeed. Poor Miss Sneyd. Though I have no youngersister, I feel for her. To be neglected before one's time must be veryvexatious; but it was entirely the mother's fault. Miss Augusta shouldhave been with her governess. Such half-and-half doings never prosper.But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price. Does she go to balls? Doesshe dine out every where, as well as at my sister's?""""No,"" replied Edmund; ""I do not think she has ever been to a ball. Mymother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with Mrs.Grant, and Fanny stays at home with _her_.""""Oh! then the point is clear. Miss Price is not out."""
Mansfield Park,6,"CHAPTER VIMr. Bertram set off for--------, and Miss Crawford was prepared tofind a great chasm in their society, and to miss him decidedly in themeetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families;and on their all dining together at the Park soon after his going, sheretook her chosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting tofeel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters. It wouldbe a very flat business, she was sure. In comparison with his brother,Edmund would have nothing to say. The soup would be sent round in a mostspiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of anyformer haunch, or a single entertaining story, about ""my friend such aone."" She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upperend of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth, who was now making hisappearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords' arrival.He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and thatfriend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver, Mr.Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject, and very eagerto be improving his own place in the same way; and though not sayingmuch to the purpose, could talk of nothing else. The subject hadbeen already handled in the drawing-room; it was revived in thedining-parlour. Miss Bertram's attention and opinion was evidently hischief aim; and though her deportment showed rather conscious superioritythan any solicitude to oblige him, the mention of Sotherton Court,and the ideas attached to it, gave her a feeling of complacency, whichprevented her from being very ungracious.""I wish you could see Compton,"" said he; ""it is the most complete thing!I never saw a place so altered in my life. I told Smith I did not knowwhere I was. The approach _now_, is one of the finest things in thecountry: you see the house in the most surprising manner. I declare,when I got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison--quite adismal old prison.""""Oh, for shame!"" cried Mrs. Norris. ""A prison indeed? Sotherton Court isthe noblest old place in the world.""""It wants improvement, ma'am, beyond anything. I never saw a place thatwanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I donot know what can be done with it.""""No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,"" said Mrs.Grant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; ""but depend upon it, Sotherton willhave _every_ improvement in time which his heart can desire.""""I must try to do something with it,"" said Mr. Rushworth, ""but I do notknow what. I hope I shall have some good friend to help me.""""Your best friend upon such an occasion,"" said Miss Bertram calmly,""would be Mr. Repton, I imagine.""""That is what I was thinking of. As he has done so well by Smith, Ithink I had better have him at once. His terms are five guineas a day.""""Well, and if they were _ten_,"" cried Mrs. Norris, ""I am sure _you_ neednot regard it. The expense need not be any impediment. If I were you,I should not think of the expense. I would have everything done in thebest style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as SothertonCourt deserves everything that taste and money can do. You have space towork upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. For my own part,if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton, Ishould be always planting and improving, for naturally I am excessivelyfond of it. It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything whereI am now, with my little half acre. It would be quite a burlesque. Butif I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight in improving andplanting. We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage: we made itquite a different place from what it was when we first had it. You youngones do not remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear Sir Thomas werehere, he could tell you what improvements we made: and a great deal morewould have been done, but for poor Mr. Norris's sad state of health.He could hardly ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and _that_disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used totalk of. If it had not been for _that_, we should have carried on thegarden wall, and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard, justas Dr. Grant has done. We were always doing something as it was. It wasonly the spring twelvemonth before Mr. Norris's death that we put in theapricot against the stable wall, which is now grown such a noble tree,and getting to such perfection, sir,"" addressing herself then to Dr.Grant.""The tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam,"" replied Dr. Grant. ""Thesoil is good; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruitshould be so little worth the trouble of gathering.""""Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it costus--that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill--and Iknow it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park.""""You were imposed on, ma'am,"" replied Dr. Grant: ""these potatoes have asmuch the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree. Itis an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable, whichnone from my garden are.""""The truth is, ma'am,"" said Mrs. Grant, pretending to whisper acrossthe table to Mrs. Norris, ""that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the naturaltaste of our apricot is: he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for itis so valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such aremarkably large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves,my cook contrives to get them all.""Mrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased; and, for a littlewhile, other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton. Dr.Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance hadbegun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again. ""Smith's placeis the admiration of all the country; and it was a mere nothing beforeRepton took it in hand. I think I shall have Repton.""""Mr. Rushworth,"" said Lady Bertram, ""if I were you, I would have avery pretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fineweather.""Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence, andtried to make out something complimentary; but, between his submissionto _her_ taste, and his having always intended the same himself, withthe superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladiesin general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom he wasanxious to please, he grew puzzled, and Edmund was glad to put an endto his speech by a proposal of wine. Mr. Rushworth, however, though notusually a great talker, had still more to say on the subject next hisheart. ""Smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in hisgrounds, which is little enough, and makes it more surprising that theplace can have been so improved. Now, at Sotherton we have a good sevenhundred, without reckoning the water meadows; so that I think, if somuch could be done at Compton, we need not despair. There have been twoor three fine old trees cut down, that grew too near the house, andit opens the prospect amazingly, which makes me think that Repton, oranybody of that sort, would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down:the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill,you know,"" turning to Miss Bertram particularly as he spoke. But MissBertram thought it most becoming to reply--""The avenue! Oh! I do not recollect it. I really know very little ofSotherton.""Fanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund, exactly oppositeMiss Crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked athim, and said in a low voice--""Cut down an avenue! What a pity! Does it not make you think of Cowper?'Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn your fate unmerited.'""He smiled as he answered, ""I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance,Fanny.""""I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down, to see the placeas it is now, in its old state; but I do not suppose I shall.""""Have you never been there? No, you never can; and, unluckily, it is outof distance for a ride. I wish we could contrive it.""""Oh! it does not signify. Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how ithas been altered.""""I collect,"" said Miss Crawford, ""that Sotherton is an old place, and aplace of some grandeur. In any particular style of building?""""The house was built in Elizabeth's time, and is a large, regular, brickbuilding; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. Itis ill placed. It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park; in thatrespect, unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are fine, andthere is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good deal of. Mr.Rushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a modern dress,and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well.""Miss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself, ""He is awell-bred man; he makes the best of it.""""I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth,"" he continued; ""but, had Ia place to new fashion, I should not put myself into the hands of animprover. I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty, of my ownchoice, and acquired progressively. I would rather abide by my ownblunders than by his.""""_You_ would know what you were about, of course; but that would notsuit _me_. I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they arebefore me; and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be mostthankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it, and give me as muchbeauty as he could for my money; and I should never look at it till itwas complete.""""It would be delightful to _me_ to see the progress of it all,"" saidFanny.""Ay, you have been brought up to it. It was no part of my education; andthe only dose I ever had, being administered by not the first favouritein the world, has made me consider improvements _in_ _hand_ as thegreatest of nuisances. Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured uncle,bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in;and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures; but it beingexcessively pretty, it was soon found necessary to be improved, and forthree months we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk tostep on, or a bench fit for use. I would have everything as completeas possible in the country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rusticseats innumerable: but it must all be done without my care. Henry isdifferent; he loves to be doing.""Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much disposed toadmire, speak so freely of her uncle. It did not suit his sense ofpropriety, and he was silenced, till induced by further smiles andliveliness to put the matter by for the present.""Mr. Bertram,"" said she, ""I have tidings of my harp at last. I amassured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably beenthese ten days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so oftenreceived to the contrary."" Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise.""The truth is, that our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant,we went ourselves: this will not do seventy miles from London; but thismorning we heard of it in the right way. It was seen by some farmer, andhe told the miller, and the miller told the butcher, and the butcher'sson-in-law left word at the shop.""""I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hopethere will be no further delay.""""I am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it is to be conveyed?Not by a wagon or cart: oh no! nothing of that kind could be hired inthe village. I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow.""""You would find it difficult, I dare say, just now, in the middle of avery late hay harvest, to hire a horse and cart?""""I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it! To wanta horse and cart in the country seemed impossible, so I told my maid tospeak for one directly; and as I cannot look out of my dressing-closetwithout seeing one farmyard, nor walk in the shrubbery without passinganother, I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather grievedthat I could not give the advantage to all. Guess my surprise, whenI found that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most impossiblething in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the labourers,all the hay in the parish! As for Dr. Grant's bailiff, I believe I hadbetter keep out of _his_ way; and my brother-in-law himself, who is allkindness in general, looked rather black upon me when he found what Ihad been at.""""You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before; butwhen you _do_ think of it, you must see the importance of getting inthe grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as yousuppose: our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, inharvest, it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse.""""I shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down with thetrue London maxim, that everything is to be got with money, I was alittle embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your countrycustoms. However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry, who isgood-nature itself, has offered to fetch it in his barouche. Will it notbe honourably conveyed?""Edmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument, and hoped to besoon allowed to hear her. Fanny had never heard the harp at all, andwished for it very much.""I shall be most happy to play to you both,"" said Miss Crawford; ""atleast as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, forI dearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal theplayer must always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways thanone. Now, Mr. Bertram, if you write to your brother, I entreat you totell him that my harp is come: he heard so much of my misery about it.And you may say, if you please, that I shall prepare my most plaintiveairs against his return, in compassion to his feelings, as I know hishorse will lose.""""If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present,foresee any occasion for writing.""""No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you everwrite to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped. The occasion wouldnever be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would notwrite to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; andwhen obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or sucha relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. You have butone style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every otherrespect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me,confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has neveryet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing morethan--'Dear Mary, I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and everythingas usual. Yours sincerely.' That is the true manly style; that is acomplete brother's letter.""""When they are at a distance from all their family,"" said Fanny,colouring for William's sake, ""they can write long letters.""""Miss Price has a brother at sea,"" said Edmund, ""whose excellence as acorrespondent makes her think you too severe upon us.""""At sea, has she? In the king's service, of course?""Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story, but his determinedsilence obliged her to relate her brother's situation: her voice wasanimated in speaking of his profession, and the foreign stations he hadbeen on; but she could not mention the number of years that he had beenabsent without tears in her eyes. Miss Crawford civilly wished him anearly promotion.""Do you know anything of my cousin's captain?"" said Edmund; ""CaptainMarshall? You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?""""Among admirals, large enough; but,"" with an air of grandeur, ""we knowvery little of the inferior ranks. Post-captains may be very good sortof men, but they do not belong to _us_. Of various admirals I could tellyou a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of theirpay, and their bickerings and jealousies. But, in general, I can assureyou that they are all passed over, and all very ill used. Certainly, myhome at my uncle's brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of_Rears_ and _Vices_ I saw enough. Now do not be suspecting me of a pun,I entreat.""Edmund again felt grave, and only replied, ""It is a noble profession.""""Yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it makethe fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, itis not a favourite profession of mine. It has never worn an amiable formto _me_.""Edmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy in the prospect ofhearing her play.The subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still underconsideration among the others; and Mrs. Grant could not help addressingher brother, though it was calling his attention from Miss JuliaBertram.""My dear Henry, have _you_ nothing to say? You have been an improveryourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any placein England. Its natural beauties, I am sure, are great. Everingham,as it _used_ to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall ofground, and such timber! What would I not give to see it again?""""Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,""was his answer; ""but I fear there would be some disappointment: youwould not find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a merenothing; you would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as forimprovement, there was very little for me to do--too little: I shouldlike to have been busy much longer.""""You are fond of the sort of thing?"" said Julia.""Excessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, whichpointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done,and my own consequent resolutions, I had not been of age threemonths before Everingham was all that it is now. My plan was laidat Westminster, a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge, and atone-and-twenty executed. I am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for havingso much happiness yet before him. I have been a devourer of my own.""""Those who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,""said Julia. ""_You_ can never want employment. Instead of envying Mr.Rushworth, you should assist him with your opinion.""Mrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother's; and asMiss Bertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,declaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consultwith friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw thebusiness into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was veryready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford's assistance; and Mr.Crawford, after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite athis service in any way that could be useful. Mr. Rushworth then began topropose Mr. Crawford's doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton,and taking a bed there; when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in her twonieces' minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr.Crawford away, interposed with an amendment.""There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford's willingness; but why should notmore of us go? Why should not we make a little party? Here are many thatwould be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth, andthat would like to hear Mr. Crawford's opinion on the spot, and thatmight be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions; and, for myown part, I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again;nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss; butnow I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth, while the restof you walked about and settled things, and then we could all returnto a late dinner here, or dine at Sotherton, just as might be mostagreeable to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight.I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche,and Edmund can go on horseback, you know, sister, and Fanny will stay athome with you.""Lady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the goingwas forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting Edmund, whoheard it all and said nothing."
Mansfield Park,7,"CHAPTER VII""Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?"" said Edmund thenext day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. ""How did youlike her yesterday?""""Very well--very much. I like to hear her talk. She entertains me; andshe is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking ather.""""It is her countenance that is so attractive. She has a wonderful playof feature! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you,Fanny, as not quite right?""""Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I wasquite astonished. An uncle with whom she has been living so many years,and who, whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother,treating him, they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it!""""I thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous.""""And very ungrateful, I think.""""Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her uncle has any claimto her _gratitude_; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth of herrespect for her aunt's memory which misleads her here. She is awkwardlycircumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must bedifficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford, withoutthrowing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which was mostto blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral's present conductmight incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural and amiablethat Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. I do not censure her_opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in making them public.""""Do not you think,"" said Fanny, after a little consideration, ""that thisimpropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her niece hasbeen entirely brought up by her? She cannot have given her right notionsof what was due to the Admiral.""""That is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the nieceto have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of thedisadvantages she has been under. But I think her present home mustdo her good. Mrs. Grant's manners are just what they ought to be. Shespeaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection.""""Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters. She made mealmost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-natureof a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anythingworth reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure Williamwould never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances. And what righthad she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters when you wereabsent?""""The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contributeto its own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, whenuntinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow ofeither in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, orloud, or coarse. She is perfectly feminine, except in the instances wehave been speaking of. There she cannot be justified. I am glad you sawit all as I did.""Having formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chanceof her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject,there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a lineof admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fannycould not follow. Miss Crawford's attractions did not lessen. The harparrived, and rather added to her beauty, wit, and good-humour; for sheplayed with the greatest obligingness, with an expression and tastewhich were peculiarly becoming, and there was something clever to besaid at the close of every air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day,to be indulged with his favourite instrument: one morning secured aninvitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have alistener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, andboth placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on alittle lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, wasenough to catch any man's heart. The season, the scene, the air, wereall favourable to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her tambourframe were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and aseverything will turn to account when love is once set going, even thesandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth lookingat. Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he wasabout, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such intercourse,to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady it may be addedthat, without his being a man of the world or an elder brother, withoutany of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk, he began tobe agreeable to her. She felt it to be so, though she had not foreseen,and could hardly understand it; for he was not pleasant by any commonrule: he talked no nonsense; he paid no compliments; his opinionswere unbending, his attentions tranquil and simple. There was a charm,perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness, his integrity, which MissCrawford might be equal to feel, though not equal to discuss withherself. She did not think very much about it, however: he pleased herfor the present; she liked to have him near her; it was enough.Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;she would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvitedand unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when theevening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he shouldthink it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home, whileMr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she thought ita very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine andwater for her, would rather go without it than not. She was a littlesurprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford, andnot see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed, and ofwhich _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the same naturewhenever she was in her company; but so it was. Edmund was fond ofspeaking to her of Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it enough thatthe Admiral had since been spared; and she scrupled to point out her ownremarks to him, lest it should appear like ill-nature. The first actualpain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of aninclination to learn to ride, which the former caught, soon after herbeing settled at Mansfield, from the example of the young ladies at thePark, and which, when Edmund's acquaintance with her increased, led tohis encouraging the wish, and the offer of his own quiet mare for thepurpose of her first attempts, as the best fitted for a beginner thateither stable could furnish. No pain, no injury, however, was designedby him to his cousin in this offer: _she_ was not to lose a day'sexercise by it. The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage halfan hour before her ride were to begin; and Fanny, on its being firstproposed, so far from feeling slighted, was almost over-powered withgratitude that he should be asking her leave for it.Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and noinconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down the mare and presidedat the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before either Fanny orthe steady old coachman, who always attended her when she rode withouther cousins, were ready to set forward. The second day's trial was notso guiltless. Miss Crawford's enjoyment of riding was such that she didnot know how to leave off. Active and fearless, and though rather small,strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to the puregenuine pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added inEdmund's attendance and instructions, and something more in theconviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her earlyprogress, to make her unwilling to dismount. Fanny was ready andwaiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone,and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared. To avoid her aunt,and look for him, she went out.The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight ofeach other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she couldlook down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all itsdemesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant'smeadow she immediately saw the group--Edmund and Miss Crawford both onhorse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,with two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. A happy partyit appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond adoubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a soundwhich did not make _her_ cheerful; she wondered that Edmund shouldforget her, and felt a pang. She could not turn her eyes from themeadow; she could not help watching all that passed. At first MissCrawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was notsmall, at a foot's pace; then, at _her_ apparent suggestion, they roseinto a canter; and to Fanny's timid nature it was most astonishing tosee how well she sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmundwas close to her; he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing hermanagement of the bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or theimagination supplied what the eye could not reach. She must not wonderat all this; what could be more natural than that Edmund should bemaking himself useful, and proving his good-nature by any one? She couldnot but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved himthe trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and becomingin a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with all hisboasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew nothingof the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund. Shebegan to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty; ifshe were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered.Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillisedby seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still onhorseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into thelane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walkedto meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.""My dear Miss Price,"" said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at allwithin hearing, ""I am come to make my own apologies for keeping youwaiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself--I knew itwas very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, ifyou please, you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven,you know, because there is no hope of a cure.""Fanny's answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his conviction thatshe could be in no hurry. ""For there is more than time enough for mycousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes,"" said he, ""and you havebeen promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half anhour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from theheat as she would have done then. I wish _you_ may not be fatigued by somuch exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home.""""No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,""said she, as she sprang down with his help; ""I am very strong. Nothingever fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way toyou with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasantride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear,delightful, beautiful animal.""The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, nowjoining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across anotherpart of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing, asshe looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together tothe village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments onMiss Crawford's great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had beenwatching with an interest almost equal to her own.""It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!""said he. ""I never see one sit a horse better. She did not seem to havea thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began,six years ago come next Easter. Lord bless you! how you did tremble whenSir Thomas first had you put on!""In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated. Her merit inbeing gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciatedby the Miss Bertrams; her delight in riding was like their own; herearly excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasurein praising it.""I was sure she would ride well,"" said Julia; ""she has the make for it.Her figure is as neat as her brother's.""""Yes,"" added Maria, ""and her spirits are as good, and she has the sameenergy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has agreat deal to do with the mind.""When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ridethe next day.""No, I do not know--not if you want the mare,"" was her answer.""I do not want her at all for myself,"" said he; ""but whenever you arenext inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad tohave her a longer time--for a whole morning, in short. She has a greatdesire to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been tellingher of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equalto it. But any morning will do for this. She would be extremely sorry tointerfere with you. It would be very wrong if she did. _She_ rides onlyfor pleasure; _you_ for health.""""I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,"" said Fanny; ""I have been outvery often lately, and would rather stay at home. You know I am strongenough now to walk very well.""Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny's comfort, and the ride toMansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all theyoung people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doublyenjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of thissort generally brings on another; and the having been to MansfieldCommon disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. Therewere many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot, therewere shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is alwaysprovided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were spentin this manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing thehonours of its finest spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety andgood-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be talkedof with pleasure--till the fourth day, when the happiness of one ofthe party was exceedingly clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund andJulia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and _she_ was excluded.It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect good-humour, on Mr.Rushworth's account, who was partly expected at the Park that day;but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good manners wereseverely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home.As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was increased, and she hadnot even the relief of shewing her power over him; she could only besullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and throw as great a gloom aspossible over their dinner and dessert.Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverseof what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria wouldscarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep;and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece's ill-humour, and havingasked one or two questions about the dinner, which were not immediatelyattended to, seemed almost determined to say no more. For a few minutesthe brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night andtheir remarks on the stars, to think beyond themselves; but when thefirst pause came, Edmund, looking around, said, ""But where is Fanny? Isshe gone to bed?""""No, not that I know of,"" replied Mrs. Norris; ""she was here a momentago.""Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which wasa very long one, told them that she was on the sofa. Mrs. Norris beganscolding.""That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the eveningupon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as_we_ do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from thepoor basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week,not touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out. Youshould learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it is ashocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa.""Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table,and had taken up her work again; and Julia, who was in high good-humour,from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming, ""Imust say, ma'am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in thehouse.""""Fanny,"" said Edmund, after looking at her attentively, ""I am sure youhave the headache.""She could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.""I can hardly believe you,"" he replied; ""I know your looks too well. Howlong have you had it?""""Since a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat.""""Did you go out in the heat?""""Go out! to be sure she did,"" said Mrs. Norris: ""would you have her staywithin such a fine day as this? Were not we _all_ out? Even your motherwas out to-day for above an hour.""""Yes, indeed, Edmund,"" added her ladyship, who had been thoroughlyawakened by Mrs. Norris's sharp reprimand to Fanny; ""I was out above anhour. I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fannycut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. Itwas shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the cominghome again.""""Fanny has been cutting roses, has she?""""Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing! _She_found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could notwait.""""There was no help for it, certainly,"" rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a rathersoftened voice; ""but I question whether her headache might not be caught_then_, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as standing andstooping in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow. Supposeyou let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always forget to have minefilled.""""She has got it,"" said Lady Bertram; ""she has had it ever since she cameback from your house the second time.""""What!"" cried Edmund; ""has she been walking as well as cutting roses;walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma'am? Nowonder her head aches.""Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.""I was afraid it would be too much for her,"" said Lady Bertram; ""butwhen the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and thenyou know they must be taken home.""""But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?""""No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and, unluckily,Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so shewas obliged to go again.""Edmund got up and walked about the room, saying, ""And could nobody beemployed on such an errand but Fanny? Upon my word, ma'am, it has been avery ill-managed business.""""I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,"" criedMrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf; ""unless I had gone myself,indeed; but I cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr.Green at that very time about your mother's dairymaid, by _her_ desire,and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son,and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour. I think nobodycan justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really Icannot do everything at once. And as for Fanny's just stepping downto my house for me--it is not much above a quarter of a mile--I cannotthink I was unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times aday, early and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing aboutit?""""I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma'am.""""If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would not beknocked up so soon. She has not been out on horseback now this longwhile, and I am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought towalk. If she had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her.But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among theroses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigueof that kind; and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.Between ourselves, Edmund,"" nodding significantly at his mother, ""it wascutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that did themischief.""""I am afraid it was, indeed,"" said the more candid Lady Bertram, who hadoverheard her; ""I am very much afraid she caught the headache there,for the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I could bearmyself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him from theflower-beds, was almost too much for me.""Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table,on which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira toFanny, and obliged her to drink the greater part. She wished to be ableto decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, madeit easier to swallow than to speak.Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still more angrywith himself. His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything whichthey had done. Nothing of this would have happened had she been properlyconsidered; but she had been left four days together without any choiceof companions or exercise, and without any excuse for avoiding whateverher unreasonable aunts might require. He was ashamed to think thatfor four days together she had not had the power of riding, and veryseriously resolved, however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure ofMiss Crawford's, that it should never happen again.Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of herarrival at the Park. The state of her spirits had probably had itsshare in her indisposition; for she had been feeling neglected, and beenstruggling against discontent and envy for some days past. As she leanton the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, thepain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and the suddenchange which Edmund's kindness had then occasioned, made her hardly knowhow to support herself."
Mansfield Park,8,"CHAPTER VIIIFanny's rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasantfresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been, Edmundtrusted that her losses, both of health and pleasure, would be soon madegood. While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his mother,who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in urging theexecution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been started afortnight before, and which, in consequence of her subsequent absencefrom home, had since lain dormant. Mrs. Norris and her nieces were allwell pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and agreedto, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies didnot forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly haveanswered for his being so, they would neither authorise the liberty norrun the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworthdiscovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk downto the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and inquire whetherWednesday would suit him or not.Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in. Having been outsome time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not methim. Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he would find Mr.Crawford at home. The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It washardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of,for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, awell-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing ofconsequence, but as it related to her own and her son's concerns,had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party. LadyBertram constantly declined it; but her placid manner of refusal madeMrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come, till Mrs. Norris's morenumerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth.""The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, Iassure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, youknow. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of ourtwo dear girls and myself without her. Sotherton is the only place thatcould give her a _wish_ to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She willhave a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well;and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will answerfor his being most happy to join the party. He can go on horseback, youknow.""Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram's staying at home,could only be sorry. ""The loss of her ladyship's company would be agreat drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seenthe young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet, andit was a pity she should not see the place.""""You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,"" cried Mrs.Norris; ""but as to Fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty ofseeing Sotherton. She has time enough before her; and her going now isquite out of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her.""""Oh no! I cannot do without Fanny.""Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody mustbe wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the invitation;and though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs.Rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly declined it onher own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister;and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in acceptingher share of the civility. Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonagesuccessful; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learnwhat had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to hercarriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two other ladies.On his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris trying tomake up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford's being of the party weredesirable or not, or whether her brother's barouche would not be fullwithout her. The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her thatthe barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, onwhich _one_ might go with him.""But why is it necessary,"" said Edmund, ""that Crawford's carriage, orhis _only_, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother'schaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the otherday, understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in thecarriage of the family.""""What!"" cried Julia: ""go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather,when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that will notquite do.""""Besides,"" said Maria, ""I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us.After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.""""And, my dear Edmund,"" added Mrs. Norris, ""taking out _two_ carriageswhen _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, betweenourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this andSotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratchinghis carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,when he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.""""That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford's,""said Maria; ""but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, anddoes not know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find noinconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.""""There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,"" said Edmund, ""ingoing on the barouche box.""""Unpleasant!"" cried Maria: ""oh dear! I believe it would be generallythought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one's viewof the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-boxherself.""""There can be no objection, then, to Fanny's going with you; there canbe no doubt of your having room for her.""""Fanny!"" repeated Mrs. Norris; ""my dear Edmund, there is no idea of hergoing with us. She stays with her aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She isnot expected.""""You can have no reason, I imagine, madam,"" said he, addressing hismother, ""for wishing Fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relatesto yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her, you wouldnot wish to keep her at home?""""To be sure not, but I _cannot_ do without her.""""You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do.""There was a general cry out at this. ""Yes,"" he continued, ""there is nonecessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a greatdesire to see Sotherton. I know she wishes it very much. She has notoften a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma'am, you would beglad to give her the pleasure now?""""Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.""Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which couldremain--their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny couldnot go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be intaking her, which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be gotover. It must have the strangest appearance! It would be something sovery unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth, whoseown manners were such a pattern of good-breeding and attention, that shereally did not feel equal to it. Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny,and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her opposition toEdmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own scheme, because it_was_ her own, than from anything else. She felt that she had arrangedeverything extremely well, and that any alteration must be for theworse. When Edmund, therefore, told her in reply, as he did when shewould give him the hearing, that she need not distress herself on Mrs.Rushworth's account, because he had taken the opportunity, as he walkedwith her through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as one who wouldprobably be of the party, and had directly received a very sufficientinvitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit witha very good grace, and would only say, ""Very well, very well, just asyou chuse, settle it your own way, I am sure I do not care about it.""""It seems very odd,"" said Maria, ""that you should be staying at homeinstead of Fanny.""""I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,"" added Julia,hastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that sheought to offer to stay at home herself.""Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,"" wasEdmund's only reply, and the subject dropt.Fanny's gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact, much greaterthan her pleasure. She felt Edmund's kindness with all, and more thanall, the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment,could be aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on heraccount gave her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sothertonwould be nothing without him.The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced anotheralteration in the plan, and one that was admitted with generalapprobation. Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to LadyBertram in lieu of her son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner.Lady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so, and the young ladieswere in spirits again. Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangementwhich restored him to his share of the party; and Mrs. Norris thought itan excellent plan, and had it at her tongue's end, and was on the pointof proposing it, when Mrs. Grant spoke.Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr.Crawford driving his sisters; and as everybody was ready, there wasnothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to taketheir places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post ofhonour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? Whileeach of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the mostappearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settledby Mrs. Grant's saying, as she stepped from the carriage, ""As there arefive of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and asyou were saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I thinkthis will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson.""Happy Julia! Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in amoment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification; andthe carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies,and the barking of Pug in his mistress's arms.Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides hadnever been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happyin observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. She wasnot often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor didshe desire it. Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually herbest companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, thebearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the harvest,the cottages, the cattle, the children, she found entertainment thatcould only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what shefelt. That was the only point of resemblance between her and the ladywho sat by her: in everything but a value for Edmund, Miss Crawford wasvery unlike her. She had none of Fanny's delicacy of taste, of mind, offeeling; she saw Nature, inanimate Nature, with little observation;her attention was all for men and women, her talents for the lightand lively. In looking back after Edmund, however, when there was anystretch of road behind them, or when he gained on them in ascending aconsiderable hill, they were united, and a ""there he is"" broke at thesame moment from them both, more than once.For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort:her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side byside, full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his expressiveprofile as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the laugh ofthe other, was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own senseof propriety could but just smooth over. When Julia looked back, it waswith a countenance of delight, and whenever she spoke to them, it was inthe highest spirits: ""her view of the country was charming, she wishedthey could all see it,"" etc.; but her only offer of exchange wasaddressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long hill,and was not more inviting than this: ""Here is a fine burst of country. Iwish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it, let me pressyou ever so much;"" and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before theywere moving again at a good pace.When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations, it wasbetter for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have two strings to herbow. She had Rushworth feelings, and Crawford feelings, and inthe vicinity of Sotherton the former had considerable effect. Mr.Rushworth's consequence was hers. She could not tell Miss Crawford that""those woods belonged to Sotherton,"" she could not carelessly observethat ""she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth's property on eachside of the road,"" without elation of heart; and it was a pleasureto increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion,and ancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights ofcourt-leet and court-baron.""Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficultiesare over. The rest of the way is such as it ought to be. Mr. Rushworthhas made it since he succeeded to the estate. Here begins the village.Those cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckonedremarkably handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the greathouse as often happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must beterrible. There is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I understandthe clergyman and his wife are very decent people. Those are almshouses,built by some of the family. To the right is the steward's house; heis a very respectable man. Now we are coming to the lodge-gates; but wehave nearly a mile through the park still. It is not ugly, you see, atthis end; there is some fine timber, but the situation of the house isdreadful. We go down hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity, forit would not be an ill-looking place if it had a better approach.""Miss Crawford was not slow to admire; she pretty well guessed MissBertram's feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote herenjoyment to the utmost. Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility; andeven Fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard withcomplacency. Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach;and after being at some pains to get a view of the house, and observingthat ""it was a sort of building which she could not look at but withrespect,"" she added, ""Now, where is the avenue? The house fronts theeast, I perceive. The avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it. Mr.Rushworth talked of the west front.""""Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, andascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may seesomething of it here--something of the more distant trees. It is oakentirely.""Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she hadknown nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion; and herspirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish,when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principalentrance."
Mansfield Park,9,"CHAPTER IXMr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the wholeparty were welcomed by him with due attention. In the drawing-room theywere met with equal cordiality by the mother, and Miss Bertram had allthe distinction with each that she could wish. After the business ofarriving was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors werethrown open to admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into theappointed dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with abundanceand elegance. Much was said, and much was ate, and all went well. Theparticular object of the day was then considered. How would Mr. Crawfordlike, in what manner would he chuse, to take a survey of the grounds?Mr. Rushworth mentioned his curricle. Mr. Crawford suggested the greaterdesirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two. ""To bedepriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments,might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure.""Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also; but thiswas scarcely received as an amendment: the young ladies neither smilednor spoke. Her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of themas had not been there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertramwas pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doingsomething.The whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth's guidancewere shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, andamply furnished in the taste of fifty years back, with shining floors,solid mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each handsomein its way. Of pictures there were abundance, and some few good, butthe larger part were family portraits, no longer anything to anybodybut Mrs. Rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all that thehousekeeper could teach, and was now almost equally well qualified toshew the house. On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly toMiss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison in the willingnessof their attention; for Miss Crawford, who had seen scores of greathouses, and cared for none of them, had only the appearance of civillylistening, while Fanny, to whom everything was almost as interestingas it was new, attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs.Rushworth could relate of the family in former times, its rise andgrandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts, delighted to connect anythingwith history already known, or warm her imagination with scenes of thepast.The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospectfrom any of the rooms; and while Fanny and some of the others wereattending Mrs. Rushworth, Henry Crawford was looking grave and shakinghis head at the windows. Every room on the west front looked acrossa lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall ironpalisades and gates.Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of anyother use than to contribute to the window-tax, and find employment forhousemaids, ""Now,"" said Mrs. Rushworth, ""we are coming to the chapel,which properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; butas we are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you willexcuse me.""They entered. Fanny's imagination had prepared her for somethinggrander than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose ofdevotion: with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusionof mahogany, and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge ofthe family gallery above. ""I am disappointed,"" said she, in a low voice,to Edmund. ""This is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing awfulhere, nothing melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no arches,no inscriptions, no banners. No banners, cousin, to be 'blown by thenight wind of heaven.' No signs that a 'Scottish monarch sleeps below.'""""You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for howconfined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles andmonasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They havebeen buried, I suppose, in the parish church. _There_ you must look forthe banners and the achievements.""""It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.""Mrs. Rushworth began her relation. ""This chapel was fitted up as you seeit, in James the Second's time. Before that period, as I understand,the pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think thatthe linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purplecloth; but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome chapel, and wasformerly in constant use both morning and evening. Prayers were alwaysread in it by the domestic chaplain, within the memory of many; but thelate Mr. Rushworth left it off.""""Every generation has its improvements,"" said Miss Crawford, with asmile, to Edmund.Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; andEdmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.""It is a pity,"" cried Fanny, ""that the custom should have beendiscontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is somethingin a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house,with one's ideas of what such a household should be! A whole familyassembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!""""Very fine indeed,"" said Miss Crawford, laughing. ""It must do the headsof the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids andfootmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here twicea day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away.""""_That_ is hardly Fanny's idea of a family assembling,"" said Edmund. ""Ifthe master and mistress do _not_ attend themselves, there must be moreharm than good in the custom.""""At any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on suchsubjects. Everybody likes to go their own way--to chuse their own timeand manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality, therestraint, the length of time--altogether it is a formidable thing, andwhat nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape inthat gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when menand women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke with aheadache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed,they would have jumped with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine with whatunwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth didmany a time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs.Bridgets--starched up into seeming piety, but with heads full ofsomething very different--especially if the poor chaplain were not worthlooking at--and, in those days, I fancy parsons were very inferior evento what they are now.""For a few moments she was unanswered. Fanny coloured and lookedat Edmund, but felt too angry for speech; and he needed a littlerecollection before he could say, ""Your lively mind can hardly beserious even on serious subjects. You have given us an amusing sketch,and human nature cannot say it was not so. We must all feel _at_ _times_the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if you aresupposing it a frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into ahabit from neglect, what could be expected from the _private_ devotionsof such persons? Do you think the minds which are suffered, whichare indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected in acloset?""""Yes, very likely. They would have two chances at least in their favour.There would be less to distract the attention from without, and it wouldnot be tried so long.""""The mind which does not struggle against itself under _one_circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the _other_, Ibelieve; and the influence of the place and of example may often rousebetter feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service,however, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. Onewishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough toforget what chapel prayers are.""While this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about thechapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford's attention to her sister, by saying,""Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly asif the ceremony were going to be performed. Have not they completely theair of it?""Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria,said, in a voice which she only could hear, ""I do not like to see MissBertram so near the altar.""Starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recoveringherself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone notmuch louder, ""If he would give her away?""""I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly,"" was his reply, with a lookof meaning.Julia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.""Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take placedirectly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether,and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant."" And shetalked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch thecomprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister tothe whispered gallantries of her lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spokewith proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to herwhenever it took place.""If Edmund were but in orders!"" cried Julia, and running to where hestood with Miss Crawford and Fanny: ""My dear Edmund, if you were but inorders now, you might perform the ceremony directly. How unlucky thatyou are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.""Miss Crawford's countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused adisinterested observer. She looked almost aghast under the new idea shewas receiving. Fanny pitied her. ""How distressed she will be at what shesaid just now,"" passed across her mind.""Ordained!"" said Miss Crawford; ""what, are you to be a clergyman?""""Yes; I shall take orders soon after my father's return--probably atChristmas.""Miss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering her complexion,replied only, ""If I had known this before, I would have spoken of thecloth with more respect,"" and turned the subject.The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillnesswhich reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year. MissBertram, displeased with her sister, led the way, and all seemed to feelthat they had been there long enough.The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and Mrs.Rushworth, never weary in the cause, would have proceeded towards theprincipal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if herson had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough. ""Forif,"" said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition which many aclearer head does not always avoid, ""we are _too_ long going over thehouse, we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. It ispast two, and we are to dine at five.""Mrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds,with the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and Mrs.Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horsesmost could be done, when the young people, meeting with an outward door,temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf andshrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds, as by one impulse, onewish for air and liberty, all walked out.""Suppose we turn down here for the present,"" said Mrs. Rushworth,civilly taking the hint and following them. ""Here are the greatestnumber of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants.""""Query,"" said Mr. Crawford, looking round him, ""whether we may not findsomething to employ us here before we go farther? I see walls of greatpromise. Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?""""James,"" said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, ""I believe the wildernesswill be new to all the party. The Miss Bertrams have never seen thewilderness yet.""No objection was made, but for some time there seemed no inclination tomove in any plan, or to any distance. All were attracted at first by theplants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy independence.Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilitiesof that end of the house. The lawn, bounded on each side by a high wall,contained beyond the first planted area a bowling-green, and beyondthe bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed by iron palisades, andcommanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wildernessimmediately adjoining. It was a good spot for fault-finding. Mr.Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth; and when,after a little time, the others began to form into parties, these threewere found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund, Miss Crawford,and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and who, after a shortparticipation of their regrets and difficulties, left them and walkedon. The remaining three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, werestill far behind; for Julia, whose happy star no longer prevailed,was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth, and restrain herimpatient feet to that lady's slow pace, while her aunt, having fallenin with the housekeeper, who was come out to feed the pheasants, waslingering behind in gossip with her. Poor Julia, the only one out ofthe nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot, was now in a state ofcomplete penance, and as different from the Julia of the barouche-box ascould well be imagined. The politeness which she had been brought up topractise as a duty made it impossible for her to escape; while thewant of that higher species of self-command, that just consideration ofothers, that knowledge of her own heart, that principle of right, whichhad not formed any essential part of her education, made her miserableunder it.""This is insufferably hot,"" said Miss Crawford, when they had taken oneturn on the terrace, and were drawing a second time to the door in themiddle which opened to the wilderness. ""Shall any of us object to beingcomfortable? Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it.What happiness if the door should not be locked! but of course it is;for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can gowhere they like.""The door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed inturning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of daybehind. A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness,which was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly oflarch and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid out with too muchregularity, was darkness and shade, and natural beauty, compared withthe bowling-green and the terrace. They all felt the refreshment of it,and for some time could only walk and admire. At length, after a shortpause, Miss Crawford began with, ""So you are to be a clergyman, Mr.Bertram. This is rather a surprise to me.""""Why should it surprise you? You must suppose me designed for someprofession, and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer, nor asoldier, nor a sailor.""""Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. And you know thereis generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the secondson.""""A very praiseworthy practice,"" said Edmund, ""but not quite universal.I am one of the exceptions, and _being_ one, must do something formyself.""""But why are you to be a clergyman? I thought _that_ was always the lotof the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him.""""Do you think the church itself never chosen, then?""""_Never_ is a black word. But yes, in the _never_ of conversation, whichmeans _not_ _very_ _often_, I do think it. For what is to be done in thechurch? Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the otherlines distinction may be gained, but not in the church. A clergyman isnothing.""""The _nothing_ of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well asthe _never_. A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion. He mustnot head mobs, or set the ton in dress. But I cannot call that situationnothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importanceto mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally andeternally, which has the guardianship of religion and morals, andconsequently of the manners which result from their influence. No onehere can call the _office_ nothing. If the man who holds it is so, itis by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance, andstepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear.""""_You_ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has beenused to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend. One does not seemuch of this influence and importance in society, and how can it beacquired where they are so seldom seen themselves? How can two sermons aweek, even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to havethe sense to prefer Blair's to his own, do all that you speak of? governthe conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the restof the week? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit.""""_You_ are speaking of London, _I_ am speaking of the nation at large.""""The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest.""""Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout thekingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is notthere that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; andit certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be mostfelt. A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in finepreaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish andhis neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a sizecapable of knowing his private character, and observing his generalconduct, which in London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lostthere in the crowds of their parishioners. They are known to the largestpart only as preachers. And with regard to their influencing publicmanners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean tocall them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of refinementand courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life. The _manners_ Ispeak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the result of goodprinciples; the effect, in short, of those doctrines which it is theirduty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe, be everywherefound, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so arethe rest of the nation.""""Certainly,"" said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.""There,"" cried Miss Crawford, ""you have quite convinced Miss Pricealready.""""I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too.""""I do not think you ever will,"" said she, with an arch smile; ""I am justas much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to takeorders. You really are fit for something better. Come, do change yourmind. It is not too late. Go into the law.""""Go into the law! With as much ease as I was told to go into thiswilderness.""""Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wildernessof the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you.""""You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a_bon_ _mot_, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a verymatter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of arepartee for half an hour together without striking it out.""A general silence succeeded. Each was thoughtful. Fanny made the firstinterruption by saying, ""I wonder that I should be tired with onlywalking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if itis not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a littlewhile.""""My dear Fanny,"" cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his,""how thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps,""turning to Miss Crawford, ""my other companion may do me the honour oftaking an arm.""""Thank you, but I am not at all tired."" She took it, however, as shespoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such aconnexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny.""You scarcely touch me,"" said he. ""You do not make me of any use. What adifference in the weight of a woman's arm from that of a man! At OxfordI have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length ofa street, and you are only a fly in the comparison.""""I am really not tired, which I almost wonder at; for we must havewalked at least a mile in this wood. Do not you think we have?""""Not half a mile,"" was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much inlove as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.""Oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. We have takensuch a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a milelong in a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet sincewe left the first great path.""""But if you remember, before we left that first great path, we sawdirectly to the end of it. We looked down the whole vista, and saw itclosed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong inlength.""""Oh! I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very longwood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came intoit; and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I mustspeak within compass.""""We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,"" said Edmund, takingout his watch. ""Do you think we are walking four miles an hour?""""Oh! do not attack me with your watch. A watch is always too fast or tooslow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch.""A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk theyhad been talking of; and standing back, well shaded and sheltered, andlooking over a ha-ha into the park, was a comfortable-sized bench, onwhich they all sat down.""I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,"" said Edmund, observing her;""why would not you speak sooner? This will be a bad day's amusement foryou if you are to be knocked up. Every sort of exercise fatigues her sosoon, Miss Crawford, except riding.""""How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did alllast week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happenagain.""""_Your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my ownneglect. Fanny's interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.""""That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for thereis nothing in the course of one's duties so fatiguing as what we havebeen doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room toanother, straining one's eyes and one's attention, hearing what one doesnot understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is generallyallowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price has foundit so, though she did not know it.""""I shall soon be rested,"" said Fanny; ""to sit in the shade on a fineday, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.""After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again. ""I must move,""said she; ""resting fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till Iam weary. I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view,without being able to see it so well.""Edmund left the seat likewise. ""Now, Miss Crawford, if you will look upthe walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long,or half half a mile.""""It is an immense distance,"" said she; ""I see _that_ with a glance.""He still reasoned with her, but in vain. She would not calculate, shewould not compare. She would only smile and assert. The greatest degreeof rational consistency could not have been more engaging, and theytalked with mutual satisfaction. At last it was agreed that they shouldendeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a littlemore about it. They would go to one end of it, in the line they werethen in--for there was a straight green walk along the bottom bythe side of the ha-ha--and perhaps turn a little way in some otherdirection, if it seemed likely to assist them, and be back in a fewminutes. Fanny said she was rested, and would have moved too, but thiswas not suffered. Edmund urged her remaining where she was with anearnestness which she could not resist, and she was left on the bench tothink with pleasure of her cousin's care, but with great regret that shewas not stronger. She watched them till they had turned the corner, andlistened till all sound of them had ceased."
Mansfield Park,10,"CHAPTER XA quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was stillthinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruptionfrom any one. She began to be surprised at being left so long, and tolisten with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voicesagain. She listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feetapproaching; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not thoseshe wanted, when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issuedfrom the same path which she had trod herself, and were before her.""Miss Price all alone"" and ""My dear Fanny, how comes this?"" were thefirst salutations. She told her story. ""Poor dear Fanny,"" cried hercousin, ""how ill you have been used by them! You had better have staidwith us.""Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she resumedthe conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed thepossibility of improvements with much animation. Nothing was fixedon; but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generallyspeaking, whatever he proposed was immediately approved, first by her,and then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be tohear the others, and who scarcely risked an original thought of his ownbeyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith's place.After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the irongate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that theirviews and their plans might be more comprehensive. It was the very thingof all others to be wished, it was the best, it was the only way ofproceeding with any advantage, in Henry Crawford's opinion; and hedirectly saw a knoll not half a mile off, which would give them exactlythe requisite command of the house. Go therefore they must to thatknoll, and through that gate; but the gate was locked. Mr. Rushworthwished he had brought the key; he had been very near thinking whether heshould not bring the key; he was determined he would never come withoutthe key again; but still this did not remove the present evil. Theycould not get through; and as Miss Bertram's inclination for so doingdid by no means lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth's declaring outrightthat he would go and fetch the key. He set off accordingly.""It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far fromthe house already,"" said Mr. Crawford, when he was gone.""Yes, there is nothing else to be done. But now, sincerely, do not youfind the place altogether worse than you expected?""""No, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete inits style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you thetruth,"" speaking rather lower, ""I do not think that _I_ shall ever seeSotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer willhardly improve it to me.""After a moment's embarrassment the lady replied, ""You are too much aman of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other peoplethink Sotherton improved, I have no doubt that you will.""""I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might begood for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent, normy memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be thecase with men of the world.""This was followed by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. ""Youseemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad tosee you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole way.""""Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollectionat what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories ofan old Irish groom of my uncle's. Your sister loves to laugh.""""You think her more light-hearted than I am?""""More easily amused,"" he replied; ""consequently, you know,"" smiling,""better company. I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irishanecdotes during a ten miles' drive.""""Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I have more to thinkof now.""""You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very highspirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are toofair to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene beforeyou.""""Do you mean literally or figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes,certainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. Butunluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint andhardship. 'I cannot get out,' as the starling said."" As she spoke, andit was with expression, she walked to the gate: he followed her. ""Mr.Rushworth is so long fetching this key!""""And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr.Rushworth's authority and protection, or I think you might with littledifficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance;I think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, andcould allow yourself to think it not prohibited.""""Prohibited! nonsense! I certainly can get out that way, and I will.Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out ofsight.""""Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he willfind us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.""Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort toprevent it. ""You will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram,"" she cried; ""you willcertainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown;you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had better notgo.""Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken,and, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she said, ""Thank you,my dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.""Fanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase of pleasantfeelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard,astonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford. By takinga circuitous route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonabledirection to the knoll, they were soon beyond her eye; and for someminutes longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion.She seemed to have the little wood all to herself. She could almosthave thought that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it wasimpossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely.She was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk. Sheexpected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath,and with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, ""Heyday!Where are the others? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.""Fanny explained.""A pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere,"" lookingeagerly into the park. ""But they cannot be very far off, and I think Iam equal to as much as Maria, even without help.""""But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. Dowait for Mr. Rushworth.""""Not I, indeed. I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why,child, I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother. Such apenance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so composedand so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in myplace, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes.""This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and letit pass: Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt that itwould not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her if shehad not seen Mr. Rushworth.""Yes, yes, we saw him. He was posting away as if upon life and death,and could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you allwere.""""It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing.""""_That_ is Miss Maria's concern. I am not obliged to punish myself for_her_ sins. The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome auntwas dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get awayfrom.""And she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, notattending to Fanny's last question of whether she had seen anything ofMiss Crawford and Edmund. The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat ofseeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continuedabsence, however, as she might have done. She felt that he had beenvery ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what hadpassed. He joined her within five minutes after Julia's exit; andthough she made the best of the story, he was evidently mortified anddispleased in no common degree. At first he scarcely said anything; hislooks only expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked tothe gate and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.""They desired me to stay--my cousin Maria charged me to say that youwould find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.""""I do not believe I shall go any farther,"" said he sullenly; ""I seenothing of them. By the time I get to the knoll they may be gonesomewhere else. I have had walking enough.""And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.""I am very sorry,"" said she; ""it is very unlucky."" And she longed to beable to say something more to the purpose.After an interval of silence, ""I think they might as well have staid forme,"" said he.""Miss Bertram thought you would follow her.""""I should not have had to follow her if she had staid.""This could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced. After another pause,he went on--""Pray, Miss Price, are you such a great admirer of this Mr.Crawford as some people are? For my part, I can see nothing in him.""""I do not think him at all handsome.""""Handsome! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. He is notfive foot nine. I should not wonder if he is not more than five footeight. I think he is an ill-looking fellow. In my opinion, theseCrawfords are no addition at all. We did very well without them.""A small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know how to contradicthim.""If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might havebeen some excuse, but I went the very moment she said she wanted it.""""Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I daresay you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, youknow, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when peopleare waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seemslike five.""He got up and walked to the gate again, and ""wished he had had the keyabout him at the time."" Fanny thought she discerned in his standingthere an indication of relenting, which encouraged her to anotherattempt, and she said, therefore, ""It is a pity you should not jointhem. They expected to have a better view of the house from that partof the park, and will be thinking how it may be improved; and nothing ofthat sort, you know, can be settled without you.""She found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining acompanion. Mr. Rushworth was worked on. ""Well,"" said he, ""if youreally think I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the keyfor nothing."" And letting himself out, he walked off without fartherceremony.Fanny's thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her solong ago, and getting quite impatient, she resolved to go in searchof them. She followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had justturned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawfordonce more caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windingsbrought them before her. They were just returned into the wildernessfrom the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them verysoon after their leaving her, and they had been across a portion of thepark into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morningto reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees. Thiswas their history. It was evident that they had been spending their timepleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their absence. Fanny'sbest consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for hervery much, and that he should certainly have come back for her, had shenot been tired already; but this was not quite sufficient to do awaywith the pain of having been left a whole hour, when he had talked ofonly a few minutes, nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to knowwhat they had been conversing about all that time; and the result ofthe whole was to her disappointment and depression, as they prepared bygeneral agreement to return to the house.On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworthand Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for thewilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving thehouse. Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatevercross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces,she had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper,after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken herto the dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the receiptfor a famous cream cheese; and since Julia's leaving them they hadbeen met by the gardener, with whom she had made a most satisfactoryacquaintance, for she had set him right as to his grandson's illness,convinced him that it was an ague, and promised him a charm for it; andhe, in return, had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants, andactually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath.On this _rencontre_ they all returned to the house together, thereto lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, andQuarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival ofdinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen camein, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partiallyagreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to theobject of the day. By their own accounts they had been all walking aftereach other, and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, toFanny's observation, to have been as much too late for re-establishingharmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration.She felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers was notthe only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was gloom on the face ofeach. Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay, and she thoughtthat he was taking particular pains, during dinner, to do away anylittle resentment of the other two, and restore general good-humour.Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles' drive homeallowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down totable, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage cameto the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained afew pheasants' eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and madeabundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead theway. At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, ""I hope Iam not to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening airin so exposed a seat."" The request had not been foreseen, but was verygraciously received, and Julia's day was likely to end almost as well asit began. Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different, andwas a little disappointed; but her conviction of being really theone preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her to receive Mr.Rushworth's parting attentions as she ought. He was certainly betterpleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascendingthe box, and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.""Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,"" saidMrs. Norris, as they drove through the park. ""Nothing but pleasure frombeginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to youraunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day'samusement you have had!""Maria was just discontented enough to say directly, ""I think _you_ havedone pretty well yourself, ma'am. Your lap seems full of good things,and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking myelbow unmercifully.""""My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice oldgardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it inmy lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me; takegreat care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just likethe excellent one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that good oldMrs. Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. I stood out as longas I could, till the tears almost came into her eyes, and I knew it wasjust the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That Mrs. Whitakeris a treasure! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine wasallowed at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids forwearing white gowns. Take care of the cheese, Fanny. Now I can managethe other parcel and the basket very well.""""What else have you been spunging?"" said Maria, half-pleased thatSotherton should be so complimented.""Spunging, my dear! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants'eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me: she would not takea denial. She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she understoodI lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort; andso to be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to set them under thefirst spare hen, and if they come to good I can have them moved to myown house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great delight to me inmy lonely hours to attend to them. And if I have good luck, your mothershall have some.""It was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was aspleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when Mrs. Norrisceased speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within. Theirspirits were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the day hadafforded most pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of almostall."
Mansfield Park,11,"CHAPTER XIThe day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the MissBertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the lettersfrom Antigua, which soon afterwards reached Mansfield. It was muchpleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to thinkof their father in England again within a certain period, which theseletters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.November was the black month fixed for his return. Sir Thomas wrote ofit with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. Hisbusiness was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to takehis passage in the September packet, and he consequently looked forwardwith the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November.Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the father brought ahusband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happinesswould unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happinessshould depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was tothrow a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she shouldsee something else. It would hardly be _early_ in November, therewere generally delays, a bad passage or _something_; that favouring_something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, ortheir understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It wouldprobably be the middle of November at least; the middle of Novemberwas three months off. Three months comprised thirteen weeks. Much mighthappen in thirteen weeks.Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half thathis daughters felt on the subject of his return, and would hardly havefound consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in thebreast of another young lady. Miss Crawford, on walking up with herbrother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news; andthough seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness, andto have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it withan attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the particularsof the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea, as MissCrawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny lookingout on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth,and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte, shesuddenly revived it by turning round towards the group, and saying, ""Howhappy Mr. Rushworth looks! He is thinking of November.""Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.""Your father's return will be a very interesting event.""""It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, butincluding so many dangers.""""It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: yoursister's marriage, and your taking orders.""""Yes.""""Don't be affronted,"" said she, laughing, ""but it does put me in mind ofsome of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits ina foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return.""""There is no sacrifice in the case,"" replied Edmund, with a serioussmile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; ""it is entirely her owndoing.""""Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more thanwhat every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her beingextremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand.""""My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria'smarrying.""""It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's convenienceshould accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, Iunderstand, hereabouts.""""Which you suppose has biassed me?""""But _that_ I am sure it has not,"" cried Fanny.""Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirmmyself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision forme probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. Therewas no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason whya man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have acompetence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not havebeen influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was tooconscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, butI think it was blamelessly.""""It is the same sort of thing,"" said Fanny, after a short pause, ""as forthe son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to bein the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody wonders thatthey should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, orsuspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear.""""No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, eithernavy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its favour:heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are alwaysacceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers andsailors.""""But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty ofpreferment may be fairly suspected, you think?"" said Edmund. ""To bejustified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertaintyof any provision.""""What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed;absolute madness.""""Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither totake orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would notknow what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman fromyour own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings whichyou rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor intheir choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, areall against him, he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wantingsincerity or good intentions in the choice of his.""""Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made,to the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doingnothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It isindolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want ofall laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclinationto take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen.A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish--read thenewspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate doesall the work, and the business of his own life is to dine.""""There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so commonas to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. Isuspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure,you are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whoseopinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible thatyour own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy.You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of menyou condemn so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told atyour uncle's table.""""I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinionis general, it is usually correct. Though _I_ have not seen much ofthe domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave anydeficiency of information.""""Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, arecondemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,or (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals,perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad,they were always wishing away.""""Poor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of theAntwerp,"" was a tender apostrophe of Fanny's, very much to the purposeof her own feelings if not of the conversation.""I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,""said Miss Crawford, ""that I can hardly suppose--and since you push me sohard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of seeingwhat clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my ownbrother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging tome, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good scholarand clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable,_I_ see him to be an indolent, selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who must havehis palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for theconvenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder,is out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the truth, Henry andI were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about agreen goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister wasforced to stay and bear it.""""I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a greatdefect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence;and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful tosuch feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt todefend Dr. Grant.""""No,"" replied Fanny, ""but we need not give up his profession for allthat; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would havetaken a--not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navyor army, have had a great many more people under his command than hehas now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor orsoldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that whateverthere may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greaterdanger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, wherehe would have had less time and obligation--where he might have escapedthat knowledge of himself, the _frequency_, at least, of that knowledgewhich it is impossible he should escape as he is now. A man--a sensibleman like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others their dutyevery week, cannot go to church twice every Sunday, and preach such verygood sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being the betterfor it himself. It must make him think; and I have no doubt that heoftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had beenanything but a clergyman.""""We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a betterfate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiablenessdepends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into agood-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrellingabout green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.""""I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,"" said Edmundaffectionately, ""must be beyond the reach of any sermons.""Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only timeto say, in a pleasant manner, ""I fancy Miss Price has been more used todeserve praise than to hear it""; when, being earnestly invited by theMiss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all hermany virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and gracefultread.""There goes good-humour, I am sure,"" said he presently. ""There goes atemper which would never give pain! How well she walks! and how readilyshe falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment sheis asked. What a pity,"" he added, after an instant's reflection, ""thatshe should have been in such hands!""Fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at thewindow with her, in spite of the expected glee; and of having his eyessoon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that wassolemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of anunclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. Fannyspoke her feelings. ""Here's harmony!"" said she; ""here's repose! Here'swhat may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry onlycan attempt to describe! Here's what may tranquillise every care, andlift the heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, Ifeel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Naturewere more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves bycontemplating such a scene.""""I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and theyare much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree,as you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature inearly life. They lose a great deal.""""_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin.""""I had a very apt scholar. There's Arcturus looking very bright.""""Yes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia.""""We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?""""Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had anystar-gazing.""""Yes; I do not know how it has happened."" The glee began. ""We will staytill this is finished, Fanny,"" said he, turning his back on the window;and as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance too,moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when itceased, he was close by the singers, among the most urgent in requestingto hear the glee again.Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris'sthreats of catching cold."
Mansfield Park,12,"CHAPTER XIISir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest son had duties tocall him earlier home. The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.Bertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letterto Edmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay,agreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawforddemanded; to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, towhich she might have listened six weeks before with some interest, andaltogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actualcomparison, of her preferring his younger brother.It was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it was;and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even wantto attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beautyrequired: his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything butpleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clearthat he did not care about her; and his indifference was so much morethan equalled by her own, that were he now to step forth the owner ofMansfield Park, the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, shedid not believe she could accept him.The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield tookMr. Crawford into Norfolk. Everingham could not do without him in thebeginning of September. He went for a fortnight--a fortnight of suchdullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on theirguard, and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, theabsolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him notto return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals ofshooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he oughtto keep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his ownmotives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity wastending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example,he would not look beyond the present moment. The sisters, handsome,clever, and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind; andfinding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield,he gladly returned to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed thitherquite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with further.Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to therepeated details of his day's sport, good or bad, his boast of his dogs,his jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their qualifications,and his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not find their way tofemale feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment onthe other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and Julia, unengaged andunemployed, felt all the right of missing him much more. Each sisterbelieved herself the favourite. Julia might be justified in so doing bythe hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit what she wished, and Mariaby the hints of Mr. Crawford himself. Everything returned into the samechannel as before his absence; his manners being to each so animated andagreeable as to lose no ground with either, and just stopping short ofthe consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth whichmight excite general notice.Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; butsince the day at Sotherton, she could never see Mr. Crawford with eithersister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure; andhad her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of itin every other respect, had she been sure that she was seeing clearly,and judging candidly, she would probably have made some importantcommunications to her usual confidant. As it was, however, she onlyhazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. ""I am rather surprised,"" saidshe, ""that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon, after being hereso long before, full seven weeks; for I had understood he was sovery fond of change and moving about, that I thought something wouldcertainly occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere. He isused to much gayer places than Mansfield.""""It is to his credit,"" was Edmund's answer; ""and I dare say it gives hissister pleasure. She does not like his unsettled habits.""""What a favourite he is with my cousins!""""Yes, his manners to women are such as must please. Mrs. Grant, Ibelieve, suspects him of a preference for Julia; I have never seen muchsymptom of it, but I wish it may be so. He has no faults but what aserious attachment would remove.""""If Miss Bertram were not engaged,"" said Fanny cautiously, ""I couldsometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.""""Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you,Fanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, beforehe has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister orintimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than thewoman herself. Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he foundhimself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her,after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.""Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to thinkdifferently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund coulddo, and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which sheoccasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say thatJulia was Mr. Crawford's choice, she knew not always what to think. Shewas privy, one evening, to the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject,as well as to her feelings, and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on apoint of some similarity, and could not help wondering as she listened;and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen, for it waswhile all the other young people were dancing, and she sitting,most unwillingly, among the chaperons at the fire, longing for there-entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own hopes of a partnerthen depended. It was Fanny's first ball, though without the preparationor splendour of many a young lady's first ball, being the thought onlyof the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of a violin player inthe servants' hall, and the possibility of raising five couple withthe help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr. Bertram's justarrived on a visit. It had, however, been a very happy one to Fannythrough four dances, and she was quite grieved to be losing even aquarter of an hour. While waiting and wishing, looking now atthe dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the twoabove-mentioned ladies was forced on her--""I think, ma'am,"" said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr.Rushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, ""we shallsee some happy faces again now.""""Yes, ma'am, indeed,"" replied the other, with a stately simper, ""therewill be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and I think it was rathera pity they should have been obliged to part. Young folks in theirsituation should be excused complying with the common forms. I wonder myson did not propose it.""""I dare say he did, ma'am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss. But dear Mariahas such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacywhich one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth--that wish ofavoiding particularity! Dear ma'am, only look at her face at thismoment; how different from what it was the two last dances!""Miss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling withpleasure, and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and herpartner, Mr. Crawford, were close to her; they were all in a clustertogether. How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for shehad been dancing with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.Mrs. Norris continued, ""It is quite delightful, ma'am, to see youngpeople so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! Icannot but think of dear Sir Thomas's delight. And what do you say,ma'am, to the chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a goodexample, and such things are very catching.""Mrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite at a loss.""The couple above, ma'am. Do you see no symptoms there?""""Oh dear! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford. Yes, indeed, a very pretty match.What is his property?""""Four thousand a year.""""Very well. Those who have not more must be satisfied with what theyhave. Four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he seems a verygenteel, steady young man, so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy.""""It is not a settled thing, ma'am, yet. We only speak of it amongfriends. But I have very little doubt it _will_ be. He is growingextremely particular in his attentions.""Fanny could listen no farther. Listening and wondering were allsuspended for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and thoughfeeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought itmust happen. He came towards their little circle; but instead of askingher to dance, drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of thepresent state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom, fromwhom he had just parted. Fanny found that it was not to be, and in themodesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonablein expecting it. When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper fromthe table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, ""If you want todance, Fanny, I will stand up with you."" With more than equal civilitythe offer was declined; she did not wish to dance. ""I am glad of it,""said he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the newspaper again,""for I am tired to death. I only wonder how the good people can keepit up so long. They had need be _all_ in love, to find any amusement insuch folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look at them you may seethey are so many couple of lovers--all but Yates and Mrs. Grant--and,between ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a lover as much as any oneof them. A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor,"" makinga sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter, who proving,however, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous a change ofexpression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in spite of everything,could hardly help laughing at. ""A strange business this in America, Dr.Grant! What is your opinion? I always come to you to know what I am tothink of public matters.""""My dear Tom,"" cried his aunt soon afterwards, ""as you are not dancing,I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shallyou?"" Then leaving her seat, and coming to him to enforce the proposal,added in a whisper, ""We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth, youknow. Your mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well sparetime to sit down herself, because of her fringe. Now, you and I and Dr.Grant will just do; and though _we_ play but half-crowns, you know, youmay bet half-guineas with _him_.""""I should be most happy,"" replied he aloud, and jumping up withalacrity, ""it would give me the greatest pleasure; but that I amthis moment going to dance."" Come, Fanny, taking her hand, ""do not bedawdling any longer, or the dance will be over.""Fanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her tofeel much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainlydid, between the selfishness of another person and his own.""A pretty modest request upon my word,"" he indignantly exclaimed as theywalked away. ""To want to nail me to a card-table for the next two hourswith herself and Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that pokingold woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. I wish my goodaunt would be a little less busy! And to ask me in such a way too!without ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibilityof refusing. _That_ is what I dislike most particularly. It raises myspleen more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, ofbeing given a choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way asto oblige one to do the very thing, whatever it be! If I had not luckilythought of standing up with you I could not have got out of it. It isa great deal too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head,nothing can stop her."""
Mansfield Park,13,"CHAPTER XIIIThe Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommendhim beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son ofa lord with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probablyhave thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable. Mr.Bertram's acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth, where they hadspent ten days together in the same society, and the friendship, iffriendship it might be called, had been proved and perfected by Mr.Yates's being invited to take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could,and by his promising to come; and he did come rather earlier than hadbeen expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large partyassembled for gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had leftWeymouth to join. He came on the wings of disappointment, and with hishead full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party; and the playin which he had borne a part was within two days of representation,when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the familyhad destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers. To be so nearhappiness, so near fame, so near the long paragraph in praise of theprivate theatricals at Ecclesford, the seat of the Right Hon. LordRavenshaw, in Cornwall, which would of course have immortalised thewhole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being so near, to loseit all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates could talk ofnothing else. Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements anddresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his never-failing subject, and toboast of the past his only consolation.Happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for actingso strong among young people, that he could hardly out-talk the interestof his hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue itwas all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been aparty concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. The playhad been Lovers' Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel. ""Atrifling part,"" said he, ""and not at all to my taste, and such a oneas I certainly would not accept again; but I was determined to make nodifficulties. Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only twocharacters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford; and though LordRavenshaw offered to resign his to me, it was impossible to take it, youknow. I was sorry for _him_ that he should have so mistaken his powers,for he was no more equal to the Baron--a little man with a weak voice,always hoarse after the first ten minutes. It must have injured thepiece materially; but _I_ was resolved to make no difficulties. SirHenry thought the duke not equal to Frederick, but that was becauseSir Henry wanted the part himself; whereas it was certainly in the besthands of the two. I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckilythe strength of the piece did not depend upon him. Our Agatha wasinimitable, and the duke was thought very great by many. And upon thewhole, it would certainly have gone off wonderfully.""""It was a hard case, upon my word""; and, ""I do think you were very muchto be pitied,"" were the kind responses of listening sympathy.""It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowagercould not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to helpwishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three dayswe wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and allhappening two hundred miles off, I think there would have been no greatharm, and it was suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose isone of the most correct men in England, would not hear of it.""""An afterpiece instead of a comedy,"" said Mr. Bertram. ""Lovers' Vowswere at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmotherby themselves. Well, the jointure may comfort _him_; and perhaps,between friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in theBaron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make _you_ amends, Yates, Ithink we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to be ourmanager.""This, though the thought of the moment, did not end with the moment; forthe inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly than inhim who was now master of the house; and who, having so much leisure asto make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such a degree oflively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the noveltyof acting. The thought returned again and again. ""Oh for the Ecclesfordtheatre and scenery to try something with."" Each sister could echo thewish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of his gratificationsit was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea. ""I reallybelieve,"" said he, ""I could be fool enough at this moment to undertakeany character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down tothe singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feelas if I could be anything or everything; as if I could rant and storm,or sigh or cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the English language.Let us be doing something. Be it only half a play, an act, a scene; whatshould prevent us? Not these countenances, I am sure,"" looking towardsthe Miss Bertrams; ""and for a theatre, what signifies a theatre? Weshall be only amusing ourselves. Any room in this house might suffice.""""We must have a curtain,"" said Tom Bertram; ""a few yards of green baizefor a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough.""""Oh, quite enough,"" cried Mr. Yates, ""with only just a side wing or tworun up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothingmore would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement amongourselves we should want nothing more.""""I believe we must be satisfied with _less_,"" said Maria. ""There wouldnot be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather adoptMr. Crawford's views, and make the _performance_, not the _theatre_, ourobject. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.""""Nay,"" said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm. ""Let us do nothingby halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fittedup with pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire frombeginning to end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a goodtricking, shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe, and asong between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do nothing.""""Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable,"" said Julia. ""Nobody loves a playbetter than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.""""True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would hardlywalk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those whohave not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who haveall the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.""After a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and wasdiscussed with unabated eagerness, every one's inclination increasingby the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; andthough nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy,and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in theworld could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all,the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as tomake Edmund quite uncomfortable. He was determined to prevent it, ifpossible, though his mother, who equally heard the conversation whichpassed at table, did not evince the least disapprobation.The same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength.Maria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates were in the billiard-room.Tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund wasstanding thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa ata little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work, thusbegan as he entered--""Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours is notto be met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no longer, and Ithink, I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but onegood thing I have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre,precisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at the fartherend, communicating with each other, as they may be made to do in fiveminutes, by merely moving the bookcase in my father's room, is the verything we could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; andmy father's room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to join thebilliard-room on purpose.""""You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?"" said Edmund, in a lowvoice, as his brother approached the fire.""Not serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise youin it?""""I think it would be very wrong. In a _general_ light, privatetheatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_ are circumstanced,I must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than injudiciousto attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of feelingon my father's account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constantdanger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whosesituation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremelydelicate.""""You take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act threetimes a week till my father's return, and invite all the country. Butit is not to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a littleamusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise ourpowers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may betrusted, I think, in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable;and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversingin the elegant written language of some respectable author than inchattering in words of our own. I have no fears and no scruples. Andas to my father's being absent, it is so far from an objection, that Iconsider it rather as a motive; for the expectation of his return mustbe a very anxious period to my mother; and if we can be the means ofamusing that anxiety, and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks,I shall think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he. Itis a _very_ anxious period for her.""As he said this, each looked towards their mother. Lady Bertram, sunkback in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease,and tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny wasgetting through the few difficulties of her work for her.Edmund smiled and shook his head.""By Jove! this won't do,"" cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair witha hearty laugh. ""To be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety--I was unluckythere.""""What is the matter?"" asked her ladyship, in the heavy tone of onehalf-roused; ""I was not asleep.""""Oh dear, no, ma'am, nobody suspected you! Well, Edmund,"" he continued,returning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as LadyBertram began to nod again, ""but _this_ I _will_ maintain, that we shallbe doing no harm.""""I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totallydisapprove it.""""And I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exerciseof talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and foranything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always adecided taste. I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. How many a timehave we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to _be'd_ andnot _to_ _be'd_, in this very room, for his amusement? And I am sure,_my_ _name_ _was_ _Norval_, every evening of my life through oneChristmas holidays.""""It was a very different thing. You must see the difference yourself. Myfather wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would neverwish his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum isstrict.""""I know all that,"" said Tom, displeased. ""I know my father as well asyou do; and I'll take care that his daughters do nothing to distresshim. Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I'll take care of the rest ofthe family.""""If you are resolved on acting,"" replied the persevering Edmund, ""I musthope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a theatreought not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father'shouse in his absence which could not be justified.""""For everything of that nature I will be answerable,"" said Tom, in adecided tone. ""His house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great aninterest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to suchalterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, orunlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of aweek without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well supposehe would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in thebreakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister'spianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolutenonsense!""""The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as anexpense.""""Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhapsit might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must haveundoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and alittle carpenter's work, and that's all; and as the carpenter's workmay be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will betoo absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed,everything will be right with Sir Thomas. Don't imagine that nobody inthis house can see or judge but yourself. Don't act yourself, if you donot like it, but don't expect to govern everybody else.""""No, as to acting myself,"" said Edmund, ""_that_ I absolutely protestagainst.""Tom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was left to sitdown and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.Fanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feelingthroughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggestsome comfort, ""Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suitthem. Your brother's taste and your sisters' seem very different.""""I have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they willfind something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_,and that is all I can do.""""I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.""""I dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or mysisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself,I shall let things take their course, without attempting it throughher. Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better doanything than be altogether by the ears.""His sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning,were quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to hisrepresentation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.Their mother had no objection to the plan, and they were not in theleast afraid of their father's disapprobation. There could be no harm inwhat had been done in so many respectable families, and by so many womenof the first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness run mad thatcould see anything to censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending onlybrothers and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never beheard of beyond themselves. Julia _did_ seem inclined to admit thatMaria's situation might require particular caution and delicacy--butthat could not extend to _her_--she was at liberty; and Maria evidentlyconsidered her engagement as only raising her so much more aboverestraint, and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult eitherfather or mother. Edmund had little to hope, but he was still urging thesubject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage,calling out, ""No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram. No wantof understrappers: my sister desires her love, and hopes to be admittedinto the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duennaor tame confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.""Maria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, ""What say you now? Can webe wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?"" And Edmund, silenced,was obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carryfascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, todwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than onanything else.The scheme advanced. Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, hewas mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any. She started nodifficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldestnephew and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the wholearrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at allto herself, as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle,and importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herselfobliged to leave her own house, where she had been living a month ather own cost, and take up her abode in theirs, that every hour might bespent in their service, she was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with theproject."
Mansfield Park,14,"CHAPTER XIVFanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed. The businessof finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; andthe carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements, hadsuggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having madethe necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident, wasalready at work, while a play was still to seek. Other preparationswere also in hand. An enormous roll of green baize had arrived fromNorthampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her goodmanagement of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forminginto a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; andas two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost tohope that none might ever be found.There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many peopleto be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such aneed that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that theredid seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth andzeal could hold out.On the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford, and Mr.Yates; on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone, because it wasevident that Mary Crawford's wishes, though politely kept back, inclinedthe same way: but his determinateness and his power seemed to makeallies unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilabledifference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in thewhole, but every character first-rate, and three principal women. Allthe best plays were run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, norOthello, nor Douglas, nor The Gamester, presented anything that couldsatisfy even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,Wheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera, were successivelydismissed with yet warmer objections. No piece could be proposed thatdid not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the otherit was a continual repetition of, ""Oh no, _that_ will never do! Let ushave no ranting tragedies. Too many characters. Not a tolerablewoman's part in the play. Anything but _that_, my dear Tom. It would beimpossible to fill it up. One could not expect anybody to take such apart. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end. _That_ might do,perhaps, but for the low parts. If I _must_ give my opinion, I havealways thought it the most insipid play in the English language. _I_ donot wish to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but Ithink we could not chuse worse.""Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishnesswhich, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wonderinghow it would end. For her own gratification she could have wished thatsomething might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play, buteverything of higher consequence was against it.""This will never do,"" said Tom Bertram at last. ""We are wasting timemost abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so thatsomething is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too manymust not frighten us. We must _double_ them. We must descend a little.If a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything ofit. From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you chuseto give me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition fornothing more.""For about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law, doubting onlywhether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself; and veryearnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others thatthere were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.The pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the samespeaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on thetable, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed--""Lovers' Vows! And whyshould not Lovers' Vows do for _us_ as well as for the Ravenshaws? Howcame it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if it would doexactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts for Yatesand Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody elsewants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not dislike,and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do my best.And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is only CountCassel and Anhalt.""The suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary ofindecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had beenproposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was particularlypleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw's, and been forced to re-rantit all in his own room. The storm through Baron Wildenheim was theheight of his theatrical ambition; and with the advantage of knowinghalf the scenes by heart already, he did now, with the greatestalacrity, offer his services for the part. To do him justice, however,he did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering that there wassome very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed an equalwillingness for that. Henry Crawford was ready to take either. WhicheverMr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a short parleyof compliment ensued. Miss Bertram, feeling all the interest of anAgatha in the question, took on her to decide it, by observing to Mr.Yates that this was a point in which height and figure ought tobe considered, and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit himpeculiarly for the Baron. She was acknowledged to be quite right, andthe two parts being accepted accordingly, she was certain of the properFrederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr. Rushworth,who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything; whenJulia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to be scrupulous onMiss Crawford's account.""This is not behaving well by the absent,"" said she. ""Here are not womenenough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothingfor your sister, Mr. Crawford.""Mr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he was very surehis sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and thatshe would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. Butthis was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part ofAmelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if shewould accept it. ""It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her,""said he, ""as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters. It can be nosacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic.""A short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt thebest claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her by therest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and withseeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled thebusiness.""I must entreat Miss _Julia_ Bertram,"" said he, ""not to engage in thepart of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You mustnot, indeed you must not"" (turning to her). ""I could not stand yourcountenance dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have hadtogether would infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his knapsackwould be obliged to run away.""Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in thematter to Julia's feelings. She saw a glance at Maria which confirmedthe injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted, Mariawas preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppressshewed how well it was understood; and before Julia could commandherself enough to speak, her brother gave his weight against her too,by saying, ""Oh yes! Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the best Agatha.Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy, I would not trust her in it.There is nothing of tragedy about her. She has not the look of it. Herfeatures are not tragic features, and she walks too quick, and speakstoo quick, and would not keep her countenance. She had better do the oldcountrywoman: the Cottager's wife; you had, indeed, Julia. Cottager'swife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The old lady relieves thehigh-flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit. Youshall be Cottager's wife.""""Cottager's wife!"" cried Mr. Yates. ""What are you talking of? The mosttrivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not atolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insultto propose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. Weall agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little morejustice, Mr. Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, ifyou cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better.""""Why, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company have reallyacted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement toJulia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager'swife; and I am sure I set her the example of moderation myself in beingsatisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will havemore credit in making something of it; and if she is so desperately bentagainst everything humorous, let her take Cottager's speeches instead ofCottager's wife's, and so change the parts all through; _he_ is solemnand pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the play,and as for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife's speeches, _I_would undertake him with all my heart.""""With all your partiality for Cottager's wife,"" said Henry Crawford, ""itwill be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and wemust not suffer her good-nature to be imposed on. We must not _allow_her to accept the part. She must not be left to her own complaisance.Her talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a character moredifficult to be well represented than even Agatha. I consider Ameliais the most difficult character in the whole piece. It requires greatpowers, great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity withoutextravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity,indeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession.It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not. It requires agentlewoman--a Julia Bertram. You _will_ undertake it, I hope?"" turningto her with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened her a little; butwhile she hesitated what to say, her brother again interposed with MissCrawford's better claim.""No, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her.She would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall androbust. Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It isfit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She looks the part, and Iam persuaded will do it admirably.""Without attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his supplication.""You must oblige us,"" said he, ""indeed you must. When you have studiedthe character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be yourchoice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_. Youwill be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you willnot refuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with yourbasket.""The influence of his voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he onlytrying to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the previousaffront? She distrusted him. The slight had been most determined. Hewas, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her. She looked suspiciouslyat her sister; Maria's countenance was to decide it: if she were vexedand alarmed--but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Juliawell knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at herexpense. With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, shesaid to him, ""You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenancewhen I come in with a basket of provisions--though one might havesupposed--but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!""She stopped--Henry Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he did notknow what to say. Tom Bertram began again--""Miss Crawford must be Amelia. She will be an excellent Amelia.""""Do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,"" cried Julia, withangry quickness: ""I am _not_ to be Agatha, and I am sure I will donothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world themost disgusting to me. I quite detest her. An odious, little, pert,unnatural, impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, andthis is comedy in its worst form."" And so saying, she walked hastilyout of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but excitingsmall compassion in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor ofthe whole, and who could not think of her as under the agitations of_jealousy_ without great pity.A short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother soonreturned to business and Lovers' Vows, and was eagerly looking overthe play, with Mr. Yates's help, to ascertain what scenery would benecessary--while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in anunder-voice, and the declaration with which she began of, ""I am sure Iwould give up the part to Julia most willingly, but that though I shallprobably do it very ill, I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse,"" wasdoubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.When this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completedby Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther inthe room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram'sresolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Ameliato Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.The first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume whichhad been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the playof which she had heard so much. Her curiosity was all awake, and she ranthrough it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals ofastonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that itcould be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! Agatha and Ameliaappeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for homerepresentation--the situation of one, and the language of the other,so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could hardlysuppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in; andlonged to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance whichEdmund would certainly make."
Mansfield Park,15,"CHAPTER XVMiss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after MissBertram's return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived, and anothercharacter was consequently cast. He had the offer of Count Casseland Anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted MissBertram to direct him; but upon being made to understand the differentstyle of the characters, and which was which, and recollecting that hehad once seen the play in London, and had thought Anhalt a very stupidfellow, he soon decided for the Count. Miss Bertram approved thedecision, for the less he had to learn the better; and though she couldnot sympathise in his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to acttogether, nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over theleaves with the hope of still discovering such a scene, she very kindlytook his part in hand, and curtailed every speech that admitted beingshortened; besides pointing out the necessity of his being very muchdressed, and chusing his colours. Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of hisfinery very well, though affecting to despise it; and was too muchengaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others,or draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of that displeasure whichMaria had been half prepared for.Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,knew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room beforedinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr.Yates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell himthe agreeable news.""We have got a play,"" said he. ""It is to be Lovers' Vows; and I am to beCount Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satincloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of ashooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it.""Fanny's eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heardthis speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.""Lovers' Vows!"" in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his only replyto Mr. Rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as ifhardly doubting a contradiction.""Yes,"" cried Mr. Yates. ""After all our debatings and difficulties, wefind there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing sounexceptionable, as Lovers' Vows. The wonder is that it should not havebeen thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we haveall the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful tohave anything of a model! We have cast almost every part.""""But what do you do for women?"" said Edmund gravely, and looking atMaria.Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, ""I take the partwhich Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and"" (with a bolder eye) ""MissCrawford is to be Amelia.""""I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filledup, with _us_,"" replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sathis mother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of greatvexation.Mr. Rushworth followed him to say, ""I come in three times, and havetwo-and-forty speeches. That's something, is not it? But I do not muchlike the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a bluedress and a pink satin cloak.""Edmund could not answer him. In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was calledout of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and beingaccompanied by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth,Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, ""I cannot,before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without reflectingon his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria, tell _you_,that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that Ihope you will give it up. I cannot but suppose you _will_ when you haveread it carefully over. Read only the first act aloud to either yourmother or aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessaryto send you to your _father's_ judgment, I am convinced.""""We see things very differently,"" cried Maria. ""I am perfectlyacquainted with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions,and so forth, which will be made, of course, I can see nothingobjectionable in it; and _I_ am not the _only_ young woman you find whothinks it very fit for private representation.""""I am sorry for it,"" was his answer; ""but in this matter it is _you_ whoare to lead. _You_ must set the example. If others have blundered, itis your place to put them right, and shew them what true delicacy is.In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of theparty.""This picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved betterto lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered, ""I ammuch obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I stillthink you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake toharangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. _There_ would be thegreatest indecorum, I think.""""Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head? No; let yourconduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining the part, you feelyourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion andconfidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness, andit will be quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand yourmotive. The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as itought.""""Do not act anything improper, my dear,"" said Lady Bertram. ""Sir Thomaswould not like it.--Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.--To besure, Julia is dressed by this time.""""I am convinced, madam,"" said Edmund, preventing Fanny, ""that Sir Thomaswould not like it.""""There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?""""If I were to decline the part,"" said Maria, with renewed zeal, ""Juliawould certainly take it.""""What!"" cried Edmund, ""if she knew your reasons!""""Oh! she might think the difference between us--the difference in oursituations--that _she_ need not be so scrupulous as _I_ might feelnecessary. I am sure she would argue so. No; you must excuse me; Icannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be sodisappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, weshall never act anything.""""I was just going to say the very same thing,"" said Mrs. Norris.""If every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and thepreparations will be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure _that_would be a discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as Mariasays, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most ofthem) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise, Edmund. AsMr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only wish Tom hadknown his own mind when the carpenters began, for there was the lossof half a day's work about those side-doors. The curtain will be a goodjob, however. The maids do their work very well, and I think we shall beable to send back some dozens of the rings. There is no occasion to putthem so very close together. I _am_ of some use, I hope, in preventingwaste and making the most of things. There should always be onesteady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot to tell Tom ofsomething that happened to me this very day. I had been looking about mein the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who should I see butDick Jackson making up to the servants' hall-door with two bits of dealboard in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be sure; mother hadchanced to send him of a message to father, and then father had bidhim bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no how do withoutthem. I knew what all this meant, for the servants' dinner-bellwas ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I hate suchencroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have alwayssaid so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to the boydirectly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know, who oughtto be ashamed of himself), '_I'll_ take the boards to your father, Dick,so get you home again as fast as you can.' The boy looked very silly,and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might speakpretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding aboutthe house for one while. I hate such greediness--so good as your fatheris to the family, employing the man all the year round!""Nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; andEdmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his onlysatisfaction.Dinner passed heavily. Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over DickJackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talkedof, for Edmund's disapprobation was felt even by his brother, thoughhe would not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford's animatingsupport, thought the subject better avoided. Mr. Yates, who was tryingto make himself agreeable to Julia, found her gloom less impenetrable onany topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company;and Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress in hishead, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:there was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of eveninggiving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their beingreassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at aseparate table, with the play open before them, and were just gettingdeep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by theentrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as itwas, could not help coming, and were received with the most gratefuljoy.""Well, how do you go on?"" and ""What have you settled?"" and ""Oh! wecan do nothing without you,"" followed the first salutations; and HenryCrawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while hissister made her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention wascomplimenting _her_. ""I must really congratulate your ladyship,"" saidshe, ""on the play being chosen; for though you have borne it withexemplary patience, I am sure you must be sick of all our noise anddifficulties. The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must beinfinitely more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give youjoy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else who is in thesame predicament,"" glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond Fanny toEdmund.She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.His being only a bystander was not disclaimed. After continuing in chatwith the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returnedto the party round the table; and standing by them, seemed tointerest herself in their arrangements till, as if struck by a suddenrecollection, she exclaimed, ""My good friends, you are most composedlyat work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray letme know my fate in the meanwhile. Who is to be Anhalt? What gentlemanamong you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?""For a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the samemelancholy truth, that they had not yet got any Anhalt. ""Mr. Rushworthwas to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt.""""I had my choice of the parts,"" said Mr. Rushworth; ""but I thought Ishould like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I amto have.""""You chose very wisely, I am sure,"" replied Miss Crawford, with abrightened look; ""Anhalt is a heavy part.""""_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,"" returned Mr. Rushworth,""which is no trifle.""""I am not at all surprised,"" said Miss Crawford, after a short pause,""at this want of an Anhalt. Amelia deserves no better. Such a forwardyoung lady may well frighten the men.""""I should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible,""cried Tom; ""but, unluckily, the Butler and Anhalt are in together. Iwill not entirely give it up, however; I will try what can be done--Iwill look it over again.""""Your _brother_ should take the part,"" said Mr. Yates, in a low voice.""Do not you think he would?""""_I_ shall not ask him,"" replied Tom, in a cold, determined manner.Miss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards rejoined theparty at the fire.""They do not want me at all,"" said she, seating herself. ""I only puzzlethem, and oblige them to make civil speeches. Mr. Edmund Bertram, asyou do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and,therefore, I apply to _you_. What shall we do for an Anhalt? Is itpracticable for any of the others to double it? What is your advice?""""My advice,"" said he calmly, ""is that you change the play.""""_I_ should have no objection,"" she replied; ""for though I should notparticularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported, that is, ifeverything went well, I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; butas they do not chuse to hear your advice at _that_ _table_"" (lookinground), ""it certainly will not be taken.""Edmund said no more.""If _any_ part could tempt _you_ to act, I suppose it would be Anhalt,""observed the lady archly, after a short pause; ""for he is a clergyman,you know.""""_That_ circumstance would by no means tempt me,"" he replied, ""for Ishould be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting. Itmust be very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemnlecturer; and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, oneof the last who would wish to represent it on the stage.""Miss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment andmortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the tea-table, andgave all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was presiding there.""Fanny,"" cried Tom Bertram, from the other table, where the conferencewas eagerly carrying on, and the conversation incessant, ""we want yourservices.""Fanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the habit ofemploying her in that way was not yet overcome, in spite of all thatEdmund could do.""Oh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat. We do not want your_present_ services. We shall only want you in our play. You must beCottager's wife.""""Me!"" cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look.""Indeed you must excuse me. I could not act anything if you were to giveme the world. No, indeed, I cannot act.""""Indeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you. It need not frightenyou: it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozenspeeches altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a wordyou say; so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have youto look at.""""If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches,"" cried Mr. Rushworth, ""whatwould you do with such a part as mine? I have forty-two to learn.""""It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,"" said Fanny, shockedto find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to feelthat almost every eye was upon her; ""but I really cannot act.""""Yes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_. Learn your part, and wewill teach you all the rest. You have only two scenes, and as I shallbe Cottager, I'll put you in and push you about, and you will do it verywell, I'll answer for it.""""No, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me. You cannot have an idea.It would be absolutely impossible for me. If I were to undertake it, Ishould only disappoint you.""""Phoo! Phoo! Do not be so shamefaced. You'll do it very well. Everyallowance will be made for you. We do not expect perfection. You mustget a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must makeyou a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of youreyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman.""""You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me,"" cried Fanny, growingmore and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfullyat Edmund, who was kindly observing her; but unwilling to exasperatehis brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile. Herentreaty had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had saidbefore; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed byMaria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which differedfrom his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and whichaltogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she could breatheafter it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in awhisper at once angry and audible--""What a piece of work here is aboutnothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty ofobliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort--so kind as they are toyou! Take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no more of thematter, I entreat.""""Do not urge her, madam,"" said Edmund. ""It is not fair to urge herin this manner. You see she does not like to act. Let her chuse forherself, as well as the rest of us. Her judgment may be quite as safelytrusted. Do not urge her any more.""""I am not going to urge her,"" replied Mrs. Norris sharply; ""but I shallthink her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what heraunt and cousins wish her--very ungrateful, indeed, considering who andwhat she is.""Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a momentwith astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears werebeginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, ""Ido not like my situation: this _place_ is too hot for me,"" and movedaway her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to Fanny, sayingto her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself, ""Never mind,my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is cross andteasing, but do not let us mind them""; and with pointed attentioncontinued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits, in spite ofbeing out of spirits herself. By a look at her brother she prevented anyfarther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelingsby which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her toall the little she had lost in Edmund's favour.Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to herfor her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work,and wishing _she_ could work as well, and begging for the pattern, andsupposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course shewould come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded toinquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said thatshe had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine youngman, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to seaagain--she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery, orhelp listening, and answering with more animation than she had intended.The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford'sattention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram's telling her,with infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him toundertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been mostanxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not do;he must give it up. ""But there will not be the smallest difficulty infilling it,"" he added. ""We have but to speak the word; we may pick andchuse. I could name, at this moment, at least six young men within sixmiles of us, who are wild to be admitted into our company, and there areone or two that would not disgrace us: I should not be afraid to trusteither of the Olivers or Charles Maddox. Tom Oliver is a very cleverfellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will seeanywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride overto Stoke, and settle with one of them.""While he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in fullexpectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this:so contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said nothing.After a moment's thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied, ""As far as Iam concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all thinkeligible. Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen? Yes, Mr. CharlesMaddox dined at my sister's one day, did not he, Henry? A quiet-lookingyoung man. I remember him. Let _him_ be applied to, if you please, forit will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger.""Charles Maddox was to be the man. Tom repeated his resolution of goingto him early on the morrow; and though Julia, who had scarcely openedher lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glancefirst at Maria and then at Edmund, that ""the Mansfield theatricals wouldenliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,"" Edmund still held hispeace, and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.""I am not very sanguine as to our play,"" said Miss Crawford, in anundervoice to Fanny, after some consideration; ""and I can tell Mr.Maddox that I shall shorten some of _his_ speeches, and a great many of_my_ _own_, before we rehearse together. It will be very disagreeable,and by no means what I expected."""
Mansfield Park,16,"CHAPTER XVIIt was not in Miss Crawford's power to talk Fanny into any realforgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over, she went tobed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attackfrom her cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her spiritssinking under her aunt's unkind reflection and reproach. To be calledinto notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the prelude tosomething so infinitely worse, to be told that she must do what wasso impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of obstinacy andingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the dependenceof her situation, had been too distressing at the time to make theremembrance when she was alone much less so, especially with thesuperadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation of thesubject. Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time; and ifshe were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritativeurgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund perhaps away,what should she do? She fell asleep before she could answer thequestion, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the nextmorning. The little white attic, which had continued her sleeping-roomever since her first entering the family, proving incompetent to suggestany reply, she had recourse, as soon as she was dressed, to anotherapartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and thinking,and of which she had now for some time been almost equally mistress. Ithad been their school-room; so called till the Miss Bertrams would notallow it to be called so any longer, and inhabited as such to a laterperiod. There Miss Lee had lived, and there they had read and written,and talked and laughed, till within the last three years, when she hadquitted them. The room had then become useless, and for some time wasquite deserted, except by Fanny, when she visited her plants, or wantedone of the books, which she was still glad to keep there, from thedeficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above: butgradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased, she had addedto her possessions, and spent more of her time there; and having nothingto oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it,that it was now generally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it hadbeen called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now consideredFanny's, almost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of theone making the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the MissBertrams, with every superiority in their own apartments which their ownsense of superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs.Norris, having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny'saccount, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobodyelse wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of theindulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitablein many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mindas Fanny's; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to bedriven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it inher hours of leisure was extreme. She could go there after anythingunpleasant below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, orsome train of thought at hand. Her plants, her books--of which she hadbeen a collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling--herwriting-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all withinher reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing woulddo, she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not aninteresting remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, orbore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes muchof suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though shehad known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almostevery recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her auntBertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, whatwas yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and herfriend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had toldher not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which madeher tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, soharmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm. Theroom was most dear to her, and she would not have changed its furniturefor the handsomest in the house, though what had been originally plainhad suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its greatest eleganciesand ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia's work, too ill donefor the drawing-room, three transparencies, made in a rage fortransparencies, for the three lower panes of one window, where TinternAbbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake inCumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought unworthy of beinganywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their side, and pinnedagainst the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from theMediterranean by William, with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom, in lettersas tall as the mainmast.To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence onan agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund's profileshe could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniumsshe might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she had morethan fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feelundecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she walked round theroom her doubts were increasing. Was she _right_ in refusing what wasso warmly asked, so strongly wished for--what might be so essential to ascheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest complaisancehad set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness, and a fear ofexposing herself? And would Edmund's judgment, would his persuasion ofSir Thomas's disapprobation of the whole, be enough to justify her in adetermined denial in spite of all the rest? It would be so horrible toher to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of herown scruples; and as she looked around her, the claims of her cousinsto being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon presentthat she had received from them. The table between the windows wascovered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which had been given her atdifferent times, principally by Tom; and she grew bewildered as to theamount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced. A tap atthe door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to herduty, and her gentle ""Come in"" was answered by the appearance of one,before whom all her doubts were wont to be laid. Her eyes brightened atthe sight of Edmund.""Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?"" said he.""Yes, certainly.""""I want to consult. I want your opinion.""""My opinion!"" she cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as itgratified her.""Yes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what to do. This actingscheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad aplay as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to askthe help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is theend of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first.I know no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy whichmust spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highlyobjectionable, the _more_ than intimacy--the familiarity. I cannotthink of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of suchmagnitude as must, _if_ _possible_, be prevented. Do not you see it inthe same light?""""Yes; but what can be done? Your brother is so determined.""""There is but _one_ thing to be done, Fanny. I must take Anhalt myself.I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom.""Fanny could not answer him.""It is not at all what I like,"" he continued. ""No man can like beingdriven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency. After being known tooppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face ofmy joining them _now_, when they are exceeding their first plan in everyrespect; but I can think of no other alternative. Can you, Fanny?""""No,"" said Fanny slowly, ""not immediately, but--""""But what? I see your judgment is not with me. Think it a little over.Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _may_, ofthe unpleasantness that _must_ arise from a young man's being receivedin this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at all hours,and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints. Tothink only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create. Itis all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford's place, Fanny. Considerwhat it would be to act Amelia with a stranger. She has a right to befelt for, because she evidently feels for herself. I heard enough ofwhat she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to beacting with a stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part withdifferent expectations--perhaps without considering the subject enoughto know what was likely to be--it would be ungenerous, it would bereally wrong to expose her to it. Her feelings ought to be respected.Does it not strike you so, Fanny? You hesitate.""""I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn into do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to thinkwill be disagreeable to my uncle. It will be such a triumph to theothers!""""They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously Iact. But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave it.But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business,of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall bewell repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing: I haveoffended them, and they will not hear me; but when I have put them ingood-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuadingthem to confine the representation within a much smaller circle thanthey are now in the high road for. This will be a material gain. Myobject is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will not thisbe worth gaining?""""Yes, it will be a great point.""""But still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any othermeasure by which I have a chance of doing equal good?""""No, I cannot think of anything else.""""Give me your approbation, then, Fanny. I am not comfortable withoutit.""""Oh, cousin!""""If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself, and yet--But it isabsolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way, riding about thecountry in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act--no matter whom:the look of a gentleman is to be enough. I thought _you_ would haveentered more into Miss Crawford's feelings.""""No doubt she will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her,"" saidFanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.""She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you lastnight. It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill.""""She _was_ very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her spared""...She could not finish the generous effusion. Her conscience stopt her inthe middle, but Edmund was satisfied.""I shall walk down immediately after breakfast,"" said he, ""and am sureof giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt youany longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I hadspoken to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head hasbeen full of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainlymaking it less than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to himdirectly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be allin high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together withsuch unanimity. _You_, in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip intoChina, I suppose. How does Lord Macartney go on?""--opening a volume onthe table and then taking up some others. ""And here are Crabbe's Tales,and the Idler, at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book. Iadmire your little establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I amgone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sitcomfortably down to your table. But do not stay here to be cold.""He went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny. Hehad told her the most extraordinary, the most inconceivable, the mostunwelcome news; and she could think of nothing else. To be acting! Afterall his objections--objections so just and so public! After all that shehad heard him say, and seen him look, and known him to be feeling. Couldit be possible? Edmund so inconsistent! Was he not deceiving himself?Was he not wrong? Alas! it was all Miss Crawford's doing. She had seenher influence in every speech, and was miserable. The doubts and alarmsas to her own conduct, which had previously distressed her, andwhich had all slept while she listened to him, were become of littleconsequence now. This deeper anxiety swallowed them up. Things shouldtake their course; she cared not how it ended. Her cousins might attack,but could hardly tease her. She was beyond their reach; and if at lastobliged to yield--no matter--it was all misery now."
Mansfield Park,17,"CHAPTER XVIIIt was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such avictory over Edmund's discretion had been beyond their hopes, and wasmost delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in theirdarling project, and they congratulated each other in private on thejealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the gleeof feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, andsay he did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the playin particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was drivento it by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descendedfrom that moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they wereboth as much the better as the happier for the descent.They behaved very well, however, to _him_ on the occasion, betraying noexultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemedto think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of CharlesMaddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him against theirinclination. ""To have it quite in their own family circle was whatthey had particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been thedestruction of all their comfort""; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they wereready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It wasall good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive hisdress, Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt's last scene with the Baronadmitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertookto count his speeches.""Perhaps,"" said Tom, ""Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now.Perhaps you may persuade _her_.""""No, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act.""""Oh! very well."" And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herselfagain in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning tofail her already.There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on thischange in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and enteredwith such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the wholeaffair as could have but one effect on him. ""He was certainly right inrespecting such feelings; he was glad he had determined on it."" And themorning wore away in satisfactions very sweet, if not very sound. Oneadvantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of MissCrawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed toundertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was allthat occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this, whenimparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford towhom she was obliged--it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were toexcite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them was spoken ofwith a glow of admiration. She was safe; but peace and safety wereunconnected here. Her mind had been never farther from peace. She couldnot feel that she had done wrong herself, but she was disquietedin every other way. Her heart and her judgment were equally againstEdmund's decision: she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and hishappiness under it made her wretched. She was full of jealousy andagitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed aninsult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she could hardlyanswer calmly. Everybody around her was gay and busy, prosperous andimportant; each had their object of interest, their part, their dress,their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were findingemployment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in the playfulconceits they suggested. She alone was sad and insignificant: she hadno share in anything; she might go or stay; she might be in the midstof their noise, or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room,without being seen or missed. She could almost think anything wouldhave been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant was of consequence: _her_good-nature had honourable mention; her taste and her time wereconsidered; her presence was wanted; she was sought for, and attended,and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her thecharacter she had accepted. But reflection brought better feelings, andshewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect, which could neverhave belonged to _her_; and that, had she received even the greatest,she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which, consideringonly her uncle, she must condemn altogether.Fanny's heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them,as she soon began to acknowledge to herself. Julia was a sufferer too,though not quite so blamelessly.Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she had very longallowed and even sought his attentions, with a jealousy of her sister soreasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the convictionof his preference for Maria had been forced on her, she submitted to itwithout any alarm for Maria's situation, or any endeavour at rationaltranquillity for herself. She either sat in gloomy silence, wrapt insuch gravity as nothing could subdue, no curiosity touch, no wit amuse;or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates, was talking with forced gaietyto him alone, and ridiculing the acting of the others.For a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford hadendeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry andcompliment, but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against afew repulses; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time formore than one flirtation, he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or ratherthought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what mightere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant. She was notpleased to see Julia excluded from the play, and sitting by disregarded;but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness, as Henrymust be the best judge of his own, and as he did assure her, with amost persuasive smile, that neither he nor Julia had ever had a seriousthought of each other, she could only renew her former caution as tothe elder sister, entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by toomuch admiration there, and then gladly take her share in anything thatbrought cheerfulness to the young people in general, and that did soparticularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her.""I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,"" was her observationto Mary.""I dare say she is,"" replied Mary coldly. ""I imagine both sisters are.""""Both! no, no, that must not be. Do not give him a hint of it. Think ofMr. Rushworth!""""You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth. It maydo _her_ some good. I often think of Mr. Rushworth's property andindependence, and wish them in other hands; but I never think of him. Aman might represent the county with such an estate; a man might escape aprofession and represent the county.""""I dare say he _will_ be in parliament soon. When Sir Thomas comes, Idare say he will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody toput him in the way of doing anything yet.""""Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home,"" saidMary, after a pause. ""Do you remember Hawkins Browne's 'Address toTobacco,' in imitation of Pope?--     Blest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense     To Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.I will parody them--     Blest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense     To Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.Will not that do, Mrs. Grant? Everything seems to depend upon SirThomas's return.""""You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see himin his family, I assure you. I do not think we do so well without him.He has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a house,and keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a ciphernow than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris inorder. But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry. Iam sure _Julia_ does not, or she would not have flirted as she did lastnight with Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good friends, Ithink she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.""""I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth's chance if Henry stept inbefore the articles were signed.""""If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon asthe play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him knowhis own mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though heis Henry, for a time.""Julia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, andthough it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise. She hadloved, she did love still, and she had all the suffering which a warmtemper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointmentof a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense of ill-usage.Her heart was sore and angry, and she was capable only of angryconsolations. The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms wasnow become her greatest enemy: they were alienated from each other;and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to theattentions which were still carrying on there, some punishment toMaria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr.Rushworth. With no material fault of temper, or difference of opinion,to prevent their being very good friends while their interests werethe same, the sisters, under such a trial as this, had not affection orprinciple enough to make them merciful or just, to give them honour orcompassion. Maria felt her triumph, and pursued her purpose, careless ofJulia; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawfordwithout trusting that it would create jealousy, and bring a publicdisturbance at last.Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there was no outwardfellowship between them. Julia made no communication, and Fanny tookno liberties. They were two solitary sufferers, or connected only byFanny's consciousness.The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia'sdiscomposure, and their blindness to its true cause, must be imputed tothe fullness of their own minds. They were totally preoccupied. Tom wasengrossed by the concerns of his theatre, and saw nothing that did notimmediately relate to it. Edmund, between his theatrical and his realpart, between Miss Crawford's claims and his own conduct, between loveand consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busyin contriving and directing the general little matters of the company,superintending their various dresses with economical expedient, forwhich nobody thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, halfa crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure forwatching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters."
Mansfield Park,18,"CHAPTER XVIIIEverything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, anddresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great impedimentsarose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was not alluninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she had not towitness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almosttoo much for her at first. Everybody began to have their vexation.Edmund had many. Entirely against _his_ judgment, a scene-painterarrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase of theexpenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their proceedings; andhis brother, instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy ofthe representation, was giving an invitation to every family who camein his way. Tom himself began to fret over the scene-painter's slowprogress, and to feel the miseries of waiting. He had learned hispart--all his parts, for he took every trifling one that could be unitedwith the Butler, and began to be impatient to be acting; and every daythus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of the insignificanceof all his parts together, and make him more ready to regret that someother play had not been chosen.Fanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often the onlylistener at hand, came in for the complaints and the distresses ofmost of them. _She_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rantdreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; thatTom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grantspoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with hispart, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth,who was wanting a prompter through every speech. She knew, also, thatpoor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him: _his_complaint came before her as well as the rest; and so decided to hereye was her cousin Maria's avoidance of him, and so needlessly often therehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she hadsoon all the terror of other complaints from _him_. So far from beingall satisfied and all enjoying, she found everybody requiring somethingthey had not, and giving occasion of discontent to the others. Everybodyhad a part either too long or too short; nobody would attend as theyought; nobody would remember on which side they were to come in; nobodybut the complainer would observe any directions.Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from theplay as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure to_her_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the firstact, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria.Maria, she also thought, acted well, too well; and after the firstrehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and sometimesas prompter, sometimes as spectator, was often very useful. As far asshe could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all: hehad more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom, more talent andtaste than Mr. Yates. She did not like him as a man, but she must admithim to be the best actor, and on this point there were not many whodiffered from her. Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his tameness andinsipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr. Rushworth turned to herwith a black look, and said, ""Do you think there is anything so veryfine in all this? For the life and soul of me, I cannot admire him; and,between ourselves, to see such an undersized, little, mean-looking man,set up for a fine actor, is very ridiculous in my opinion.""From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which Maria,from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to remove; andthe chances of Mr. Rushworth's ever attaining to the knowledge of histwo-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his ever making anything_tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that excepthis mother; _she_, indeed, regretted that his part was not moreconsiderable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they wereforward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes; but theothers aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword, and thefirst line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter throughthe rest. Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness, was at great pains toteach him how to learn, giving him all the helps and directions in herpower, trying to make an artificial memory for him, and learning everyword of his part herself, but without his being much the forwarder.Many uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she certainly had;but with all these, and other claims on her time and attention, she wasas far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them,as without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having nodemand on her leisure as on her compassion. The gloom of her firstanticipations was proved to have been unfounded. She was occasionallyuseful to all; she was perhaps as much at peace as any.There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which herhelp was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well offas the rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it--""Come,Fanny,"" she cried, ""these are fine times for you, but you must not bealways walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on atyour ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself tillI can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth's cloak without sendingfor any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help in puttingit together. There are but three seams; you may do them in a trice. Itwould be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do._You_ are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than _you_,we should not get on very fast.""Fanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; buther kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf--""One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted: it isall new to her, you know; you and I used to be very fond of a playourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more atleisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too. What is the playabout, Fanny? you have never told me.""""Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those whocan talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers' Vows.""""I believe,"" said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, ""there will be three actsrehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity ofseeing all the actors at once.""""You had better stay till the curtain is hung,"" interposed Mrs. Norris;""the curtain will be hung in a day or two--there is very little sense ina play without a curtain--and I am much mistaken if you do not find itdraw up into very handsome festoons.""Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting. Fanny did not share heraunt's composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if thethree acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be actingtogether for the first time; the third act would bring a scene betweenthem which interested her most particularly, and which she was longingand dreading to see how they would perform. The whole subject of it waslove--a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman, and verylittle short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.She had read and read the scene again with many painful, many wonderingemotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as acircumstance almost too interesting. She did not _believe_ they had yetrehearsed it, even in private.The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny'sconsideration of it did not become less agitated. She worked verydiligently under her aunt's directions, but her diligence and hersilence concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon shemade her escape with her work to the East room, that she might have noconcern in another, and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal ofthe first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous atonce of having her time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr.Rushworth. A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladieswalking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat, andshe worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a quarter ofan hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance ofMiss Crawford.""Am I right? Yes; this is the East room. My dear Miss Price, I beg yourpardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help.""Fanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the roomby her civilities, and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate withconcern.""Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm. Allow me to stay here a littlewhile, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act. I have broughtmy book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be _so_obliged! I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund--byourselves--against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he_were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him_, till I havehardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two. You willbe so good, won't you?""Fanny was most civil in her assurances, though she could not give themin a very steady voice.""Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?"" continued MissCrawford, opening her book. ""Here it is. I did not think much of it atfirst--but, upon my word. There, look at _that_ speech, and _that_, and_that_. How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things? Couldyou do it? But then he is your cousin, which makes all the difference.You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy _you_ him, and get on bydegrees. You _have_ a look of _his_ sometimes.""""Have I? I will do my best with the greatest readiness; but I must_read_ the part, for I can say very little of it.""""_None_ of it, I suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now forit. We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to thefront of the stage. There--very good school-room chairs, not made for atheatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kicktheir feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would yourgoverness and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? CouldSir Thomas look in upon us just now, he would bless himself, for weare rehearsing all over the house. Yates is storming away in thedining-room. I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre is engagedof course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If_they_ are not perfect, I _shall_ be surprised. By the bye, I looked inupon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of thetimes when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was withme. I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off aswell as I could, by whispering to him, 'We shall have an excellentAgatha; there is something so _maternal_ in her manner, so completely_maternal_ in her voice and countenance.' Was not that well done of me?He brightened up directly. Now for my soliloquy.""She began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which theidea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; butwith looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture ofa man. With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;and they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door broughta pause, and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the threeon this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very samebusiness that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure werelikely to be more than momentary in _them_. He too had his book, and wasseeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him, and help him to preparefor the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house;and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together, ofcomparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny's kind offices._She_ could not equal them in their warmth. _Her_ spirits sank under theglow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing toboth to have any comfort in having been sought by either. They must nowrehearse together. Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny waswanted only to prompt and observe them. She was invested, indeed, withthe office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it andtell them all their faults; but from doing so every feeling within hershrank--she could not, would not, dared not attempt it: had she beenotherwise qualified for criticism, her conscience must have restrainedher from venturing at disapprobation. She believed herself to feel toomuch of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars. Toprompt them must be enough for her; and it was sometimes _more_ thanenough; for she could not always pay attention to the book. In watchingthem she forgot herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit ofEdmund's manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as hewanted help. It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she wasthanked and pitied; but she deserved their pity more than she hoped theywould ever surmise. At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced herselfto add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other; and whenagain alone and able to recall the whole, she was inclined to believetheir performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling in it asmust ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering exhibition toherself. Whatever might be its effect, however, she must stand the bruntof it again that very day.The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly totake place in the evening: Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged toreturn for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner; and everyone concerned was looking forward with eagerness. There seemed a generaldiffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. Tom was enjoying such anadvance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the morning'srehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away. Allwere alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the gentlemen soonfollowed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, andJulia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour; and having lightedit up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only thearrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.They did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there was no Mrs. Grant.She could not come. Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which hehad little credit with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his wife.""Dr. Grant is ill,"" said she, with mock solemnity. ""He has been ill eversince he did not eat any of the pheasant today. He fancied it tough,sent away his plate, and has been suffering ever since"".Here was disappointment! Mrs. Grant's non-attendance was sad indeed.Her pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her always valuableamongst them; but _now_ she was absolutely necessary. They could notact, they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her. Thecomfort of the whole evening was destroyed. What was to be done? Tom, asCottager, was in despair. After a pause of perplexity, some eyes beganto be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, ""If Miss Pricewould be so good as to _read_ the part."" She was immediately surroundedby supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, ""Do, Fanny, ifit is not _very_ disagreeable to you.""But Fanny still hung back. She could not endure the idea of it. Why wasnot Miss Crawford to be applied to as well? Or why had not she rathergone to her own room, as she had felt to be safest, instead of attendingthe rehearsal at all? She had known it would irritate and distress her;she had known it her duty to keep away. She was properly punished.""You have only to _read_ the part,"" said Henry Crawford, with renewedentreaty.""And I do believe she can say every word of it,"" added Maria, ""for shecould put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places. Fanny, I amsure you know the part.""Fanny could not say she did _not_; and as they all persevered, asEdmund repeated his wish, and with a look of even fond dependence onher good-nature, she must yield. She would do her best. Everybody wassatisfied; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart,while the others prepared to begin.They _did_ begin; and being too much engaged in their own noise to bestruck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house, had proceededsome way when the door of the room was thrown open, and Julia, appearingat it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, ""My father is come! He is inthe hall at this moment."""
Mansfield Park,19,"CHAPTER XIXHow is the consternation of the party to be described? To the greaternumber it was a moment of absolute horror. Sir Thomas in the house! Allfelt the instantaneous conviction. Not a hope of imposition or mistakewas harboured anywhere. Julia's looks were an evidence of the fact thatmade it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations, not aword was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance waslooking at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the mostunwelcome, most ill-timed, most appalling! Mr. Yates might considerit only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr. Rushworthmight imagine it a blessing; but every other heart was sinking undersome degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm, every other heartwas suggesting, ""What will become of us? what is to be done now?"" Itwas a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were the corroboratingsounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.Julia was the first to move and speak again. Jealousy and bitternesshad been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at themoment of her appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of devotionto Agatha's narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart; and as soonas she could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock of herwords, he still kept his station and retained her sister's hand, herwounded heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she hadbeen white before, she turned out of the room, saying, ""_I_ need not beafraid of appearing before him.""Her going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothersstepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something. A very fewwords between them were sufficient. The case admitted no difference ofopinion: they must go to the drawing-room directly. Maria joined themwith the same intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for thevery circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetestsupport. Henry Crawford's retaining her hand at such a moment, a momentof such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt andanxiety. She hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination,and was equal even to encounter her father. They walked off, utterlyheedless of Mr. Rushworth's repeated question of, ""Shall I go too? Hadnot I better go too? Will not it be right for me to go too?"" but theywere no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answerthe anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him by all means to pay hisrespects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him after the others withdelighted haste.Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates. She had been quiteoverlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims on SirThomas's affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classingherself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and gain alittle breathing-time. Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that wasendured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not eveninnocence could keep from suffering. She was nearly fainting: all herformer habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it compassionfor him and for almost every one of the party on the development beforehim, with solicitude on Edmund's account indescribable. She had founda seat, where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearfulthoughts, while the other three, no longer under any restraint, weregiving vent to their feelings of vexation, lamenting over such anunlooked-for premature arrival as a most untoward event, and withoutmercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage, orwere still in Antigua.The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from betterunderstanding the family, and judging more clearly of the mischief thatmust ensue. The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they feltthe total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for theevening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal beingrenewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over,and he might be at leisure to be amused by it. The Crawfords laughedat the idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walkingquietly home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr. Yates'saccompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage. But Mr.Yates, having never been with those who thought much of parental claims,or family confidence, could not perceive that anything of the kind wasnecessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, ""he preferred remainingwhere he was, that he might pay his respects to the old gentlemanhandsomely since he _was_ come; and besides, he did not think it wouldbe fair by the others to have everybody run away.""Fanny was just beginning to collect herself, and to feel that if shestaid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point wassettled, and being commissioned with the brother and sister's apology,saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform thedreadful duty of appearing before her uncle.Too soon did she find herself at the drawing-room door; and afterpausing a moment for what she knew would not come, for a courage whichthe outside of no door had ever supplied to her, she turned the lock indesperation, and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collectedfamily, were before her. As she entered, her own name caught her ear.Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him, and saying, ""But whereis Fanny? Why do not I see my little Fanny?""--and on perceiving her,came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,calling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately, and observingwith decided pleasure how much she was grown! Fanny knew not how tofeel, nor where to look. She was quite oppressed. He had never been sokind, so _very_ kind to her in his life. His manner seemed changed, hisvoice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awfulin his dignity seemed lost in tenderness. He led her nearer the lightand looked at her again--inquired particularly after her health, andthen, correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire, forher appearance spoke sufficiently on that point. A fine blush havingsucceeded the previous paleness of her face, he was justified in hisbelief of her equal improvement in health and beauty. He inquired nextafter her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether wassuch as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and thinkinghis return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift her eyes tohis face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged,worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender feeling wasincreased, and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspectedvexation was probably ready to burst on him.Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at his suggestionnow seated themselves round the fire. He had the best right to be thetalker; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his ownhouse, in the centre of his family, after such a separation, made himcommunicative and chatty in a very unusual degree; and he was ready togive every information as to his voyage, and answer every questionof his two sons almost before it was put. His business in Antigua hadlatterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a privatevessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the littleparticulars of his proceedings and events, his arrivals and departures,were most promptly delivered, as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked withheartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him--interrupting himselfmore than once, however, to remark on his good fortune in finding themall at home--coming unexpectedly as he did--all collected togetherexactly as he could have wished, but dared not depend on. Mr. Rushworthwas not forgotten: a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shakinghad already met him, and with pointed attention he was now included inthe objects most intimately connected with Mansfield. There was nothingdisagreeable in Mr. Rushworth's appearance, and Sir Thomas was likinghim already.By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken,unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really extremely happy tosee him, and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as toplace her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.She had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained sosensibly animated as to put away her work, move Pug from her side, andgive all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband. Shehad no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her_ pleasure: her own time hadbeen irreproachably spent during his absence: she had done a greatdeal of carpet-work, and made many yards of fringe; and she would haveanswered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of allthe young people as for her own. It was so agreeable to her to seehim again, and hear him talk, to have her ear amused and her wholecomprehension filled by his narratives, that she began particularlyto feel how dreadfully she must have missed him, and how impossible itwould have been for her to bear a lengthened absence.Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to hersister. Not that _she_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas'sdisapprobation when the present state of his house should be known, forher judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive cautionwith which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth's pink satin cloak as herbrother-in-law entered, she could hardly be said to shew any sign ofalarm; but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return. It had left hernothing to do. Instead of being sent for out of the room, and seeinghim first, and having to spread the happy news through the house, SirThomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the nerves of hiswife and children, had sought no confidant but the butler, and had beenfollowing him almost instantaneously into the drawing-room. Mrs. Norrisfelt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended,whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded; and wasnow trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about,and labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillityand silence. Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she might have goneto the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted the footmenwith injunctions of despatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined alldinner: he would take nothing, nothing till tea came--he would ratherwait for tea. Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging somethingdifferent; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England,when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height, she burstthrough his recital with the proposal of soup. ""Sure, my dear SirThomas, a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea.Do have a basin of soup.""Sir Thomas could not be provoked. ""Still the same anxiety foreverybody's comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,"" was his answer. ""But indeed Iwould rather have nothing but tea.""""Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; supposeyou hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night."" She carriedthis point, and Sir Thomas's narrative proceeded.At length there was a pause. His immediate communications wereexhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him, nowat one, now at another of the beloved circle; but the pause was notlong: in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, andwhat were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say, ""Howdo you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, SirThomas? They have been acting. We have been all alive with acting.""""Indeed! and what have you been acting?""""Oh! they'll tell you all about it.""""The _all_ will soon be told,"" cried Tom hastily, and with affectedunconcern; ""but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now. Youwill hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by wayof doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last week,to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant rainsalmost since October began, that we have been nearly confined to thehouse for days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd.Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no attemptinganything since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmundtook the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace betweenus, and might each have killed six times as many, but we respect yourpheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire. I do notthink you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than theywere. _I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my lifeas this year. I hope you will take a day's sport there yourself, sir,soon.""For the present the danger was over, and Fanny's sick feelings subsided;but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas, getting up,said that he found that he could not be any longer in the house withoutjust looking into his own dear room, every agitation was returning. Hewas gone before anything had been said to prepare him for the change hemust find there; and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance. Edmundwas the first to speak--""Something must be done,"" said he.""It is time to think of our visitors,"" said Maria, still feeling herhand pressed to Henry Crawford's heart, and caring little for anythingelse. ""Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?""Fanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.""Then poor Yates is all alone,"" cried Tom. ""I will go and fetch him. Hewill be no bad assistant when it all comes out.""To the theatre he went, and reached it just in time to witness the firstmeeting of his father and his friend. Sir Thomas had been a good dealsurprised to find candles burning in his room; and on casting his eyeround it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general airof confusion in the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from beforethe billiard-room door struck him especially, but he had scarcely morethan time to feel astonished at all this, before there were sounds fromthe billiard-room to astonish him still farther. Some one was talkingthere in a very loud accent; he did not know the voice--more thantalking--almost hallooing. He stepped to the door, rejoicing at thatmoment in having the means of immediate communication, and, opening it,found himself on the stage of a theatre, and opposed to a ranting youngman, who appeared likely to knock him down backwards. At the very momentof Yates perceiving Sir Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best starthe had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals, Tom Bertramentered at the other end of the room; and never had he found greaterdifficulty in keeping his countenance. His father's looks of solemnityand amazement on this his first appearance on any stage, and the gradualmetamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred andeasy Mr. Yates, making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, wassuch an exhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would not havelost upon any account. It would be the last--in all probability--thelast scene on that stage; but he was sure there could not be a finer.The house would close with the greatest eclat.There was little time, however, for the indulgence of any images ofmerriment. It was necessary for him to step forward, too, and assistthe introduction, and with many awkward sensations he did his best. SirThomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality whichwas due to his own character, but was really as far from pleasedwith the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of itscommencement. Mr. Yates's family and connexions were sufficiently knownto him to render his introduction as the ""particular friend,"" another ofthe hundred particular friends of his son, exceedingly unwelcome; and itneeded all the felicity of being again at home, and all the forbearanceit could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thusbewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous exhibition inthe midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so untoward a moment toadmit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving,and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the firstfive minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two.Tom understood his father's thoughts, and heartily wishing he might bealways as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began tosee, more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be someground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance hisfather gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that when heinquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard-table, he wasnot proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity. A few minutes wereenough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and SirThomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words ofcalm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to thehappiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen returned to thedrawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which wasnot lost on all.""I come from your theatre,"" said he composedly, as he sat down; ""I foundmyself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room--but inevery respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallestsuspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character. Itappears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by candlelight,and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit."" And then he wouldhave changed the subject, and sipped his coffee in peace over domesticmatters of a calmer hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to catch SirThomas's meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion enough toallow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others withthe least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on the topic of thetheatre, would torment him with questions and remarks relative to it,and finally would make him hear the whole history of his disappointmentat Ecclesford. Sir Thomas listened most politely, but found much tooffend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his ill-opinion of Mr. Yates'shabits of thinking, from the beginning to the end of the story; and whenit was over, could give him no other assurance of sympathy than what aslight bow conveyed.""This was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting,"" said Tom, aftera moment's thought. ""My friend Yates brought the infection fromEcclesford, and it spread--as those things always spread, you know,sir--the faster, probably, from _your_ having so often encouraged thesort of thing in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again.""Mr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible, andimmediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and weredoing: told him of the gradual increase of their views, the happyconclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state ofaffairs; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him notonly totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of hisfriends as they sat, the change of countenance, the fidget, the hem! ofunquietness, but prevented him even from seeing the expression of theface on which his own eyes were fixed--from seeing Sir Thomas's darkbrow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughtersand Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking alanguage, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he_ felt at his heart. Notless acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behindher aunt's end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself, saw allthat was passing before her. Such a look of reproach at Edmund from hisfather she could never have expected to witness; and to feel that itwas in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed. Sir Thomas'slook implied, ""On your judgment, Edmund, I depended; what have youbeen about?"" She knelt in spirit to her uncle, and her bosom swelled toutter, ""Oh, not to _him_! Look so to all the others, but not to _him_!""Mr. Yates was still talking. ""To own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were inthe middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening. We were goingthrough the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole. Ourcompany is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home, thatnothing more can be done to-night; but if you will give us the honour ofyour company to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the result. Webespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young performers; we bespeakyour indulgence.""""My indulgence shall be given, sir,"" replied Sir Thomas gravely, ""butwithout any other rehearsal."" And with a relenting smile, he added, ""Icome home to be happy and indulgent."" Then turning away towards anyor all of the rest, he tranquilly said, ""Mr. and Miss Crawford werementioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeableacquaintance?""Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he being entirelywithout particular regard for either, without jealousy either in loveor acting, could speak very handsomely of both. ""Mr. Crawford was amost pleasant, gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant,lively girl.""Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer. ""I do not say he is notgentleman-like, considering; but you should tell your father he is notabove five feet eight, or he will be expecting a well-looking man.""Sir Thomas did not quite understand this, and looked with some surpriseat the speaker.""If I must say what I think,"" continued Mr. Rushworth, ""in my opinion itis very disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much of agood thing. I am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think we area great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves,and doing nothing.""Sir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving smile, ""I amhappy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It givesme sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and quick-sighted,and feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel, is perfectlynatural; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity, for ahome which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much exceed theirs. But atyour time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstancefor yourself, and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible ofthe importance of having an ally of such weight.""Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth's opinion in better wordsthan he could find himself. He was aware that he must not expect agenius in Mr. Rushworth; but as a well-judging, steady young man, withbetter notions than his elocution would do justice to, he intended tovalue him very highly. It was impossible for many of the others not tosmile. Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning; but bylooking, as he really felt, most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas'sgood opinion, and saying scarcely anything, he did his best towardspreserving that good opinion a little longer."
Mansfield Park,20,"CHAPTER XXEdmund's first object the next morning was to see his father alone, andgive him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his ownshare in it as far only as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel hismotives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, thathis concession had been attended with such partial good as to make hisjudgment in it very doubtful. He was anxious, while vindicating himself,to say nothing unkind of the others: but there was only one amongstthem whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defenceor palliation. ""We have all been more or less to blame,"" said he, ""everyone of us, excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has judged rightlythroughout; who has been consistent. _Her_ feelings have been steadilyagainst it from first to last. She never ceased to think of what was dueto you. You will find Fanny everything you could wish.""Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,and at such a time, as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must; hefelt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands withEdmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and forget howmuch he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could, after the househad been cleared of every object enforcing the remembrance, and restoredto its proper state. He did not enter into any remonstrance with hisother children: he was more willing to believe they felt their errorthan to run the risk of investigation. The reproof of an immediateconclusion of everything, the sweep of every preparation, would besufficient.There was one person, however, in the house, whom he could not leaveto learn his sentiments merely through his conduct. He could not helpgiving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice mighthave been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly havedisapproved. The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming theplan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves;but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of unsteadycharacters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he must regard heracquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of their unsafeamusements, than that such measures and such amusements should havebeen suggested. Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearlybeing silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was ashamed toconfess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaringto Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her influence wasinsufficient--that she might have talked in vain. Her only resource wasto get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn the currentof Sir Thomas's ideas into a happier channel. She had a great deal toinsinuate in her own praise as to _general_ attention to the interestand comfort of his family, much exertion and many sacrifices to glanceat in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from her ownfireside, and many excellent hints of distrust and economy to LadyBertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most considerable saving hadalways arisen, and more than one bad servant been detected. But herchief strength lay in Sotherton. Her greatest support and glory wasin having formed the connexion with the Rushworths. _There_ shewas impregnable. She took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr.Rushworth's admiration of Maria to any effect. ""If I had not beenactive,"" said she, ""and made a point of being introduced to his mother,and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit, I am as certainas I sit here that nothing would have come of it; for Mr. Rushworthis the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal ofencouragement, and there were girls enough on the catch for him if wehad been idle. But I left no stone unturned. I was ready to move heavenand earth to persuade my sister, and at last I did persuade her. Youknow the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle of winter, and theroads almost impassable, but I did persuade her.""""I know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady Bertramand her children, and am the more concerned that it should not havebeen.""""My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads _that_ day!I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the fourhorses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of hisgreat love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box onaccount of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever sinceMichaelmas. I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter--andthis was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room beforewe set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his wig; soI said, 'Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I shall bevery safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has been upon theleaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.' But, however, Isoon found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and as I hate to beworrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart quite ached for himat every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke, where,what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse than anythingyou can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him. And then the poorhorses too! To see them straining away! You know how I always feel forthe horses. And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do youthink I did? You will laugh at me; but I got out and walked up. I didindeed. It might not be saving them much, but it was something, and Icould not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense ofthose noble animals. I caught a dreadful cold, but _that_ I did notregard. My object was accomplished in the visit.""""I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble thatmight be taken to establish it. There is nothing very striking in Mr.Rushworth's manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared tobe his opinion on one subject: his decided preference of a quiet familyparty to the bustle and confusion of acting. He seemed to feel exactlyas one could wish.""""Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better you will like him.He is not a shining character, but he has a thousand good qualities; andis so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it,for everybody considers it as my doing. 'Upon my word, Mrs. Norris,'said Mrs. Grant the other day, 'if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own,he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect.'""Sir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by herflattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction thatwhere the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her kindnessdid sometimes overpower her judgment.It was a busy morning with him. Conversation with any of them occupiedbut a small part of it. He had to reinstate himself in all the wontedconcerns of his Mansfield life: to see his steward and his bailiff; toexamine and compute, and, in the intervals of business, to walk intohis stables and his gardens, and nearest plantations; but active andmethodical, he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat asmaster of the house at dinner, he had also set the carpenter to work inpulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard-room,and given the scene-painter his dismissal long enough to justify thepleasing belief of his being then at least as far off as Northampton.The scene-painter was gone, having spoilt only the floor of one room,ruined all the coachman's sponges, and made five of the under-servantsidle and dissatisfied; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day ortwo would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers' Vows in thehouse, for he was burning all that met his eye.Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas's intentions,though as far as ever from understanding their source. He and his friendhad been out with their guns the chief of the morning, and Tom had takenthe opportunity of explaining, with proper apologies for his father'sparticularity, what was to be expected. Mr. Yates felt it as acutely asmight be supposed. To be a second time disappointed in the same way wasan instance of very severe ill-luck; and his indignation was such,that had it not been for delicacy towards his friend, and his friend'syoungest sister, he believed he should certainly attack the baroneton the absurdity of his proceedings, and argue him into a little morerationality. He believed this very stoutly while he was in MansfieldWood, and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir Thomas,when they sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think itwiser to let him pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it withoutopposition. He had known many disagreeable fathers before, and oftenbeen struck with the inconveniences they occasioned, but never, inthe whole course of his life, had he seen one of that class sounintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He wasnot a man to be endured but for his children's sake, and he might bethankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to staya few days longer under his roof.The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost everymind was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from hisdaughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in agood deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her thatCrawford should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she wasdisturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advancethat point. She had been expecting to see him the whole morning, andall the evening, too, was still expecting him. Mr. Rushworth had set offearly with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped forsuch an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him the trouble ofever coming back again. But they had seen no one from the Parsonage,not a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note ofcongratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram. It was thefirst day for many, many weeks, in which the families had been whollydivided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before, since Augustbegan, without bringing them together in some way or other. It was asad, anxious day; and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,did by no means bring less. A few moments of feverish enjoyment werefollowed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was again in thehouse: he walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respectsto Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into thebreakfast-room, where were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon appeared,and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man sheloved to her father. Her sensations were indefinable, and so were theya few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who had a chairbetween herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice whetherthere were any plans for resuming the play after the present happyinterruption (with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in thatcase, he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any timerequired by the party: he was going away immediately, being to meet hisuncle at Bath without delay; but if there were any prospect of a renewalof Lovers' Vows, he should hold himself positively engaged, he shouldbreak through every other claim, he should absolutely condition with hisuncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted. The play shouldnot be lost by _his_ absence.""From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,"" said he; ""I willattend you from any place in England, at an hour's notice.""It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not his sister. Hecould immediately say with easy fluency, ""I am sorry you are going;but as to our play, _that_ is all over--entirely at an end"" (lookingsignificantly at his father). ""The painter was sent off yesterday, andvery little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how _that_would be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobodythere.""""It is about my uncle's usual time.""""When do you think of going?""""I may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day.""""Whose stables do you use at Bath?"" was the next question; and whilethis branch of the subject was under discussion, Maria, who wantedneither pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her share of itwith tolerable calmness.To her he soon turned, repeating much of what he had already said, withonly a softened air and stronger expressions of regret. But what availedhis expressions or his air? He was going, and, if not voluntarily going,voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting what might be dueto his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed. He might talk ofnecessity, but she knew his independence. The hand which had so pressedhers to his heart! the hand and the heart were alike motionless andpassive now! Her spirit supported her, but the agony of her mind wassevere. She had not long to endure what arose from listening to languagewhich his actions contradicted, or to bury the tumult of her feelingsunder the restraint of society; for general civilities soon calledhis notice from her, and the farewell visit, as it then became openlyacknowledged, was a very short one. He was gone--he had touched herhand for the last time, he had made his parting bow, and she might seekdirectly all that solitude could do for her. Henry Crawford was gone,gone from the house, and within two hours afterwards from the parish;and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in Maria andJulia Bertram.Julia could rejoice that he was gone. His presence was beginning to beodious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now cool enough todispense with any other revenge. She did not want exposure to be addedto desertion. Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister.With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence. She heard itat dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentionedwith regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling--fromthe sincerity of Edmund's too partial regard, to the unconcern of hismother speaking entirely by rote. Mrs. Norris began to look about her,and wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; andcould almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it; butwith so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her_ activity tokeep pace with her wishes?Another day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise. In _his_ departureSir Thomas felt the chief interest: wanting to be alone with his family,the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome;but of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was every wayvexatious. In himself he was wearisome, but as the friend of Tom andthe admirer of Julia he became offensive. Sir Thomas had been quiteindifferent to Mr. Crawford's going or staying: but his good wishesfor Mr. Yates's having a pleasant journey, as he walked with him to thehall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction. Mr. Yates had staid tosee the destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield, theremoval of everything appertaining to the play: he left the house in allthe soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas hoped, in seeinghim out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme,and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence.Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that mighthave distressed him. The curtain, over which she had presided with suchtalent and such success, went off with her to her cottage, where shehappened to be particularly in want of green baize."
Mansfield Park,21,"CHAPTER XXISir Thomas's return made a striking change in the ways of the family,independent of Lovers' Vows. Under his government, Mansfield was analtered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spiritsof many others saddened--it was all sameness and gloom compared withthe past--a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was littleintercourse with the Parsonage. Sir Thomas, drawing back from intimaciesin general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, for anyengagements but in one quarter. The Rushworths were the only addition tohis own domestic circle which he could solicit.Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father's feelings, norcould he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants. ""But they,"" heobserved to Fanny, ""have a claim. They seem to belong to us; they seemto be part of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible oftheir very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away. Iam afraid they may feel themselves neglected. But the truth is, that myfather hardly knows them. They had not been here a twelvemonth when heleft England. If he knew them better, he would value their society as itdeserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he wouldlike. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves: mysisters seem out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at his ease. Dr.and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings pass away withmore enjoyment even to my father.""""Do you think so?"" said Fanny: ""in my opinion, my uncle would not like_any_ addition. I think he values the very quietness you speak of, andthat the repose of his own family circle is all he wants. And it doesnot appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be--I meanbefore my uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was alwaysmuch the same. There was never much laughing in his presence; or, ifthere is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absencehas a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness; butI cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry, exceptwhen my uncle was in town. No young people's are, I suppose, when thosethey look up to are at home"".""I believe you are right, Fanny,"" was his reply, after a shortconsideration. ""I believe our evenings are rather returned to what theywere, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their beinglively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give!I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.""""I suppose I am graver than other people,"" said Fanny. ""The evenings donot appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies.I could listen to him for an hour together. It entertains _me_ more thanmany other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I daresay.""""Why should you dare say _that_?"" (smiling). ""Do you want to be toldthat you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet?But when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny? Goto my father if you want to be complimented. He will satisfy you. Askyour uncle what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: andthough they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, andtrust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time.""Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her.""Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny--and that is the long andthe short of the matter. Anybody but myself would have made somethingmore of it, and anybody but you would resent that you had not beenthought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle neverdid admire you till now--and now he does. Your complexion is soimproved!--and you have gained so much countenance!--and yourfigure--nay, Fanny, do not turn away about it--it is but an uncle. Ifyou cannot bear an uncle's admiration, what is to become of you? Youmust really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth lookingat. You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman.""""Oh! don't talk so, don't talk so,"" cried Fanny, distressed by morefeelings than he was aware of; but seeing that she was distressed, hehad done with the subject, and only added more seriously--""Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and Ionly wish you would talk to him more. You are one of those who are toosilent in the evening circle.""""But I do talk to him more than I used. I am sure I do. Did not you hearme ask him about the slave-trade last night?""""I did--and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others. Itwould have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther.""""And I longed to do it--but there was such a dead silence! And whilemy cousins were sitting by without speaking a word, or seeming at allinterested in the subject, I did not like--I thought it would appear asif I wanted to set myself off at their expense, by shewing a curiosityand pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters tofeel.""""Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day:that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other womenwere of neglect. We were talking of you at the Parsonage, and those wereher words. She has great discernment. I know nobody who distinguishescharacters better. For so young a woman it is remarkable! She certainlyunderstands _you_ better than you are understood by the greater part ofthose who have known you so long; and with regard to some others, I canperceive, from occasional lively hints, the unguarded expressions ofthe moment, that she could define _many_ as accurately, did not delicacyforbid it. I wonder what she thinks of my father! She must admire himas a fine-looking man, with most gentlemanlike, dignified, consistentmanners; but perhaps, having seen him so seldom, his reserve may bea little repulsive. Could they be much together, I feel sure of theirliking each other. He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents tovalue his powers. I wish they met more frequently! I hope she does notsuppose there is any dislike on his side.""""She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you,""said Fanny, with half a sigh, ""to have any such apprehension. And SirThomas's wishing just at first to be only with his family, is so verynatural, that she can argue nothing from that. After a little while, Idare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way, allowingfor the difference of the time of year.""""This is the first October that she has passed in the country since herinfancy. I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and Novemberis a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant is veryanxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on.""Fanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing, andleave untouched all Miss Crawford's resources--her accomplishments, herspirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her intoany observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford's kind opinion ofherself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, and she began to talkof something else.""To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr.Bertram too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my unclemay continue to like Mr. Rushworth.""""That is impossible, Fanny. He must like him less after to-morrow'svisit, for we shall be five hours in his company. I should dreadthe stupidity of the day, if there were not a much greater evil tofollow--the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. He cannot muchlonger deceive himself. I am sorry for them all, and would givesomething that Rushworth and Maria had never met.""In this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas.Not all his good-will for Mr. Rushworth, not all Mr. Rushworth'sdeference for him, could prevent him from soon discerning some part ofthe truth--that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorantin business as in books, with opinions in general unfixed, and withoutseeming much aware of it himself.He had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning to feelgrave on Maria's account, tried to understand _her_ feelings. Littleobservation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was themost favourable state they could be in. Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworthwas careless and cold. She could not, did not like him. Sir Thomasresolved to speak seriously to her. Advantageous as would be thealliance, and long standing and public as was the engagement, herhappiness must not be sacrificed to it. Mr. Rushworth had, perhaps, beenaccepted on too short an acquaintance, and, on knowing him better, shewas repenting.With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her: told her his fears,inquired into her wishes, entreated her to be open and sincere, andassured her that every inconvenience should be braved, and the connexionentirely given up, if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it. Hewould act for her and release her. Maria had a moment's struggle as shelistened, and only a moment's: when her father ceased, she was able togive her answer immediately, decidedly, and with no apparent agitation.She thanked him for his great attention, his paternal kindness, but hewas quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breakingthrough her engagement, or was sensible of any change of opinion orinclination since her forming it. She had the highest esteem for Mr.Rushworth's character and disposition, and could not have a doubt of herhappiness with him.Sir Thomas was satisfied; too glad to be satisfied, perhaps, to urge thematter quite so far as his judgment might have dictated to others. Itwas an alliance which he could not have relinquished without pain;and thus he reasoned. Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve. Mr.Rushworth must and would improve in good society; and if Maria could nowspeak so securely of her happiness with him, speaking certainly withoutthe prejudice, the blindness of love, she ought to be believed. Herfeelings, probably, were not acute; he had never supposed them to beso; but her comforts might not be less on that account; and if she coulddispense with seeing her husband a leading, shining character, therewould certainly be everything else in her favour. A well-disposed youngwoman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more attachedto her own family; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfieldmust naturally hold out the greatest temptation, and would, in allprobability, be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocentenjoyments. Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas,happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture, the wonder,the reflections, the reproach that must attend it; happy to secure amarriage which would bring him such an addition of respectabilityand influence, and very happy to think anything of his daughter'sdisposition that was most favourable for the purpose.To her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him. She was in astate of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall:that she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton; that she was safe fromthe possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions,and destroying her prospects; and retired in proud resolve, determinedonly to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future, that herfather might not be again suspecting her.Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or fourdays after Henry Crawford's leaving Mansfield, before her feelings wereat all tranquillised, before she had given up every hope of him, orabsolutely resolved on enduring his rival, her answer might have beendifferent; but after another three or four days, when there was noreturn, no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart, no hopeof advantage from separation, her mind became cool enough to seek allthe comfort that pride and self revenge could give.Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness, but he should not know thathe had done it; he should not destroy her credit, her appearance, herprosperity, too. He should not have to think of her as pining in theretirement of Mansfield for _him_, rejecting Sotherton and London,independence and splendour, for _his_ sake. Independence was moreneedful than ever; the want of it at Mansfield more sensibly felt. Shewas less and less able to endure the restraint which her father imposed.The liberty which his absence had given was now become absolutelynecessary. She must escape from him and Mansfield as soon as possible,and find consolation in fortune and consequence, bustle and the world,for a wounded spirit. Her mind was quite determined, and varied not.To such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation, would havebeen an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for themarriage than herself. In all the important preparations of the mindshe was complete: being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home,restraint, and tranquillity; by the misery of disappointed affection,and contempt of the man she was to marry. The rest might wait. Thepreparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London andspring, when her own taste could have fairer play.The principals being all agreed in this respect, it soon appeared that avery few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must precedethe wedding.Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire, and make way for the fortunateyoung woman whom her dear son had selected; and very early in Novemberremoved herself, her maid, her footman, and her chariot, with truedowager propriety, to Bath, there to parade over the wonders ofSotherton in her evening parties; enjoying them as thoroughly, perhaps,in the animation of a card-table, as she had ever done on the spot; andbefore the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place whichgave Sotherton another mistress.It was a very proper wedding. The bride was elegantly dressed; the twobridesmaids were duly inferior; her father gave her away; her motherstood with salts in her hand, expecting to be agitated; her aunt triedto cry; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant. Nothingcould be objected to when it came under the discussion of theneighbourhood, except that the carriage which conveyed the bride andbridegroom and Julia from the church-door to Sotherton was the samechaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before. Ineverything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictestinvestigation.It was done, and they were gone. Sir Thomas felt as an anxious fathermust feel, and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which hiswife had been apprehensive of for herself, but had fortunately escaped.Mrs. Norris, most happy to assist in the duties of the day, by spendingit at the Park to support her sister's spirits, and drinking the healthof Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two, was alljoyous delight; for she had made the match; she had done everything;and no one would have supposed, from her confident triumph, that shehad ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life, or could have thesmallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been broughtup under her eye.The plan of the young couple was to proceed, after a few days, toBrighton, and take a house there for some weeks. Every public place wasnew to Maria, and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer. Whenthe novelty of amusement there was over, it would be time for the widerrange of London.Julia was to go with them to Brighton. Since rivalry between the sistershad ceased, they had been gradually recovering much of their former goodunderstanding; and were at least sufficiently friends to make each ofthem exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time. Some othercompanion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady;and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria, thoughshe might not have struggled through so much to obtain them, and couldbetter bear a subordinate situation.Their departure made another material change at Mansfield, a chasmwhich required some time to fill up. The family circle became greatlycontracted; and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little toits gaiety, they could not but be missed. Even their mother missed them;and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered aboutthe house, and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree ofaffectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve!"
Mansfield Park,22,"CHAPTER XXIIFanny's consequence increased on the departure of her cousins. Becoming,as she then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room, the onlyoccupier of that interesting division of a family in which she hadhitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not to bemore looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she had ever beenbefore; and ""Where is Fanny?"" became no uncommon question, even withouther being wanted for any one's convenience.Not only at home did her value increase, but at the Parsonage too. Inthat house, which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris'sdeath, she became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the gloom and dirtof a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford. Her visits there,beginning by chance, were continued by solicitation. Mrs. Grant,really eager to get any change for her sister, could, by the easiestself-deceit, persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing byFanny, and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement inpressing her frequent calls.Fanny, having been sent into the village on some errand by her auntNorris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage; andbeing descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelterunder the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond theirpremises, was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on herpart, to come in. A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Granthimself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but tobe very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible; andto poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal rainin a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all herplan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing asingle creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, thesound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Pricedripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful. The value of anevent on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her.She was all alive again directly, and among the most active in beinguseful to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at firstallow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny, after beingobliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted andwaited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returningdownstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the raincontinued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thusextended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the periodof dressing and dinner.The two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant, that Fanny mighthave enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way,and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear atthe end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant'scarriage and horses out to take her home, with which she was threatened.As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather mightoccasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that score; for as herbeing out was known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly aware thatnone would be felt, and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuseto establish her during the rain, her being in such cottage would beindubitable to aunt Bertram.It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in theroom, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an acknowledgmentof her wishing very much to hear it, and a confession, which couldhardly be believed, of her having never yet heard it since its beingin Mansfield. To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and naturalcircumstance. She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since theinstrument's arrival, there had been no reason that she should; but MissCrawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject, wasconcerned at her own neglect; and ""Shall I play to you now?"" and ""Whatwill you have?"" were questions immediately following with the readiestgood-humour.She played accordingly; happy to have a new listener, and a listener whoseemed so much obliged, so full of wonder at the performance, and whoshewed herself not wanting in taste. She played till Fanny's eyes,straying to the window on the weather's being evidently fair, spoke whatshe felt must be done.""Another quarter of an hour,"" said Miss Crawford, ""and we shall see howit will be. Do not run away the first moment of its holding up. Thoseclouds look alarming.""""But they are passed over,"" said Fanny. ""I have been watching them. Thisweather is all from the south.""""South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must notset forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I want to playsomething more to you--a very pretty piece--and your cousin Edmund'sprime favourite. You must stay and hear your cousin's favourite.""Fanny felt that she must; and though she had not waited for thatsentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her particularlyawake to his idea, and she fancied him sitting in that room againand again, perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening withconstant delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her,with superior tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself,and glad to like whatever was liked by him, she was more sincerelyimpatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before;and on this being evident, she was so kindly asked to call again, totake them in her walk whenever she could, to come and hear more of theharp, that she felt it necessary to be done, if no objection arose athome.Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place betweenthem within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams' going away--anintimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford's desire of somethingnew, and which had little reality in Fanny's feelings. Fanny went to herevery two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could notbe easy without going, and yet it was without loving her, without everthinking like her, without any sense of obligation for being soughtafter now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higherpleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_often at the expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantryon people or subjects which she wished to be respected. She went,however, and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs.Grant's shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time ofyear, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches nowcomparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the midstof some tender ejaculation of Fanny's on the sweets of so protractedan autumn, they were forced, by the sudden swell of a cold gust shakingdown the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and walk forwarmth.""This is pretty, very pretty,"" said Fanny, looking around her asthey were thus sitting together one day; ""every time I come into thisshrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty. Three years ago,this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field,never thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything; and nowit is converted into a walk, and it would be difficult to say whethermost valuable as a convenience or an ornament; and perhaps, in anotherthree years, we may be forgetting--almost forgetting what it was before.How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and thechanges of the human mind!"" And following the latter train of thought,she soon afterwards added: ""If any one faculty of our nature may becalled _more_ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. Thereseems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers,the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of ourintelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, soobedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, sotyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way;but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly pastfinding out.""Miss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing to say; andFanny, perceiving it, brought back her own mind to what she thought mustinterest.""It may seem impertinent in _me_ to praise, but I must admire the tasteMrs. Grant has shewn in all this. There is such a quiet simplicity inthe plan of the walk! Not too much attempted!""""Yes,"" replied Miss Crawford carelessly, ""it does very well for aplace of this sort. One does not think of extent _here_; and betweenourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parsonever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind.""""I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!"" said Fanny, in reply. ""Myuncle's gardener always says the soil here is better than his own, andso it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general.The evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen!When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In somecountries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but thatdoes not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun shouldnurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence.You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especiallywhen I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort ofwondering strain. One cannot fix one's eyes on the commonest naturalproduction without finding food for a rambling fancy.""""To say the truth,"" replied Miss Crawford, ""I am something like thefamous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see nowonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody hadtold me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should bespending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly shouldnot have believed them. I have now been here nearly five months; and,moreover, the quietest five months I ever passed.""""_Too_ quiet for you, I believe.""""I should have thought so _theoretically_ myself, but,"" and her eyesbrightened as she spoke, ""take it all and all, I never spent so happy asummer. But then,"" with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, ""thereis no saying what it may lead to.""Fanny's heart beat quick, and she felt quite unequal to surmisingor soliciting anything more. Miss Crawford, however, with renewedanimation, soon went on--""I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residencethan I had ever expected to be. I can even suppose it pleasant tospend _half_ the year in the country, under certain circumstances,very pleasant. An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of familyconnexions; continual engagements among them; commanding the firstsociety in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it evenmore than those of larger fortune, and turning from the cheerful roundof such amusements to nothing worse than a _tete-a-tete_ with the personone feels most agreeable in the world. There is nothing frightful insuch a picture, is there, Miss Price? One need not envy the new Mrs.Rushworth with such a home as _that_.""""Envy Mrs. Rushworth!"" was all that Fanny attempted to say. ""Come, come,it would be very un-handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth, for Ilook forward to our owing her a great many gay, brilliant, happy hours.I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year. Sucha match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing; for the firstpleasures of Mr. Rushworth's wife must be to fill her house, and givethe best balls in the country.""Fanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, tillsuddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she exclaimed, ""Ah!here he is."" It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund, who thenappeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant. ""My sister and Mr.Bertram. I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone, that he may be Mr.Bertram again. There is something in the sound of Mr. _Edmund_ Bertramso formal, so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it.""""How differently we feel!"" cried Fanny. ""To me, the sound of _Mr._Bertram is so cold and nothing-meaning, so entirely without warmth orcharacter! It just stands for a gentleman, and that's all. But there isnobleness in the name of Edmund. It is a name of heroism and renown; ofkings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalryand warm affections.""""I grant you the name is good in itself, and _Lord_ Edmund or _Sir_Edmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill, the annihilationof a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas. Well,shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sittingdown out of doors at this time of year, by being up before they canbegin?""Edmund met them with particular pleasure. It was the first time of hisseeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintancewhich he had been hearing of with great satisfaction. A friendshipbetween two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished:and to the credit of the lover's understanding, be it stated, that hedid not by any means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greatergainer by such a friendship.""Well,"" said Miss Crawford, ""and do you not scold us for our imprudence?What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked toabout it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so again?""""Perhaps I might have scolded,"" said Edmund, ""if either of you had beensitting down alone; but while you do wrong together, I can overlook agreat deal.""""They cannot have been sitting long,"" cried Mrs. Grant, ""for when I wentup for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window, and then they werewalking.""""And really,"" added Edmund, ""the day is so mild, that your sitting downfor a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent. Our weather mustnot always be judged by the calendar. We may sometimes take greaterliberties in November than in May.""""Upon my word,"" cried Miss Crawford, ""you are two of the mostdisappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with! There is nogiving you a moment's uneasiness. You do not know how much we have beensuffering, nor what chills we have felt! But I have long thought Mr.Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvreagainst common sense, that a woman could be plagued with. I had verylittle hope of _him_ from the first; but you, Mrs. Grant, my sister, myown sister, I think I had a right to alarm you a little.""""Do not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary. You have not the smallestchance of moving me. I have my alarms, but they are quite in a differentquarter; and if I could have altered the weather, you would have had agood sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time--for here are some ofmy plants which Robert _will_ leave out because the nights are so mild,and I know the end of it will be, that we shall have a sudden change ofweather, a hard frost setting in all at once, taking everybody (at leastRobert) by surprise, and I shall lose every one; and what is worse, cookhas just been telling me that the turkey, which I particularly wishednot to be dressed till Sunday, because I know how much more Dr. Grantwould enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keepbeyond to-morrow. These are something like grievances, and make me thinkthe weather most unseasonably close.""""The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!"" said Miss Crawfordarchly. ""Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer.""""My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St.Paul's, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as youcould be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you haveme do?""""Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often,and never lose your temper.""""Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, livewhere we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, Idare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman andthe poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness andunpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawingforth bitter lamentations.""""I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort.A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. Itcertainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it.""""You intend to be very rich?"" said Edmund, with a look which, to Fanny'seye, had a great deal of serious meaning.""To be sure. Do not you? Do not we all?""""I cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my powerto command. Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth. She has onlyto fix on her number of thousands a year, and there can be no doubt oftheir coming. My intentions are only not to be poor.""""By moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants to your income,and all that. I understand you--and a very proper plan it is for aperson at your time of life, with such limited means and indifferentconnexions. What can _you_ want but a decent maintenance? You havenot much time before you; and your relations are in no situation to doanything for you, or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealthand consequence. Be honest and poor, by all means--but I shall not envyyou; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I have a much greaterrespect for those that are honest and rich.""""Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is precisely whatI have no manner of concern with. I do not mean to be poor. Povertyis exactly what I have determined against. Honesty, in the somethingbetween, in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I amanxious for your not looking down on.""""But I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher. I mustlook down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise todistinction.""""But how may it rise? How may my honesty at least rise to anydistinction?""This was not so very easy a question to answer, and occasioned an ""Oh!""of some length from the fair lady before she could add, ""You ought to bein parliament, or you should have gone into the army ten years ago.""""_That_ is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being inparliament, I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly forthe representation of younger sons who have little to live on. No, MissCrawford,"" he added, in a more serious tone, ""there _are_ distinctionswhich I should be miserable if I thought myself without anychance--absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining--but theyare of a different character.""A look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed a consciousnessof manner on Miss Crawford's side as she made some laughing answer,was sorrowfull food for Fanny's observation; and finding herself quiteunable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she was nowfollowing the others, she had nearly resolved on going home immediately,and only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of the great clockat Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that she hadreally been much longer absent than usual, and brought the previousself-inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just then, and how,to a very speedy issue. With undoubting decision she directly began heradieus; and Edmund began at the same time to recollect that his motherhad been inquiring for her, and that he had walked down to the Parsonageon purpose to bring her back.Fanny's hurry increased; and without in the least expecting Edmund'sattendance, she would have hastened away alone; but the general pace wasquickened, and they all accompanied her into the house, through which itwas necessary to pass. Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as they stoptto speak to him she found, from Edmund's manner, that he _did_ mean togo with her. He too was taking leave. She could not but be thankful. Inthe moment of parting, Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his muttonwith him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for an unpleasantfeeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden recollection,turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company too. This wasso new an attention, so perfectly new a circumstance in the events ofFanny's life, that she was all surprise and embarrassment; and whilestammering out her great obligation, and her ""but she did not suppose itwould be in her power,"" was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help.But Edmund, delighted with her having such an happiness offered, andascertaining with half a look, and half a sentence, that she had noobjection but on her aunt's account, could not imagine that his motherwould make any difficulty of sparing her, and therefore gave his decidedopen advice that the invitation should be accepted; and though Fannywould not venture, even on his encouragement, to such a flight ofaudacious independence, it was soon settled, that if nothing were heardto the contrary, Mrs. Grant might expect her.""And you know what your dinner will be,"" said Mrs. Grant, smiling--""theturkey, and I assure you a very fine one; for, my dear,"" turning to herhusband, ""cook insists upon the turkey's being dressed to-morrow.""""Very well, very well,"" cried Dr. Grant, ""all the better; I am gladto hear you have anything so good in the house. But Miss Price and Mr.Edmund Bertram, I dare say, would take their chance. We none of us wantto hear the bill of fare. A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner,is all we have in view. A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, orwhatever you and your cook chuse to give us.""The two cousins walked home together; and, except in the immediatediscussion of this engagement, which Edmund spoke of with the warmestsatisfaction, as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy whichhe saw with so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk; forhaving finished that subject, he grew thoughtful and indisposed for anyother."
Mansfield Park,23,"CHAPTER XXIII""But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?"" said Lady Bertram. ""How came sheto think of asking Fanny? Fanny never dines there, you know, in thissort of way. I cannot spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go.Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?""""If you put such a question to her,"" cried Edmund, preventing hiscousin's speaking, ""Fanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, mydear mother, she would like to go; and I can see no reason why sheshould not.""""I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her? She neverdid before. She used to ask your sisters now and then, but she neverasked Fanny.""""If you cannot do without me, ma'am--"" said Fanny, in a self-denyingtone.""But my mother will have my father with her all the evening.""""To be sure, so I shall.""""Suppose you take my father's opinion, ma'am.""""That's well thought of. So I will, Edmund. I will ask Sir Thomas, assoon as he comes in, whether I can do without her.""""As you please, ma'am, on that head; but I meant my father's opinionas to the _propriety_ of the invitation's being accepted or not; andI think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as byFanny, that being the _first_ invitation it should be accepted.""""I do not know. We will ask him. But he will be very much surprised thatMrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.""There was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any purpose,till Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it did,her own evening's comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in LadyBertram's mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his looking in for aminute in his way from his plantation to his dressing-room, she calledhim back again, when he had almost closed the door, with ""Sir Thomas,stop a moment--I have something to say to you.""Her tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble of raising hervoice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back. Herstory began; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room; for to hearherself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than hernerves could bear. She was anxious, she knew--more anxious perhaps thanshe ought to be--for what was it after all whether she went or staid?but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding, andwith very grave looks, and those grave looks directed to her, andat last decide against her, she might not be able to appear properlysubmissive and indifferent. Her cause, meanwhile, went on well. Itbegan, on Lady Bertram's part, with--""I have something to tell you thatwill surprise you. Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.""""Well,"" said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise.""Edmund wants her to go. But how can I spare her?""""She will be late,"" said Sir Thomas, taking out his watch; ""but what isyour difficulty?""Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in hismother's story. He told the whole; and she had only to add, ""So strange!for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her.""""But is it not very natural,"" observed Edmund, ""that Mrs. Grant shouldwish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister?""""Nothing can be more natural,"" said Sir Thomas, after a shortdeliberation; ""nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything,in my opinion, be more natural. Mrs. Grant's shewing civility to MissPrice, to Lady Bertram's niece, could never want explanation. The onlysurprise I can feel is, that this should be the _first_ time of itsbeing paid. Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditionalanswer. She appears to feel as she ought. But as I conclude that shemust wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can seeno reason why she should be denied the indulgence.""""But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?""""Indeed I think you may.""""She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.""""Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us, andI shall certainly be at home.""""Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.""The good news soon followed her. Edmund knocked at her door in his wayto his own.""Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the smallesthesitation on your uncle's side. He had but one opinion. You are to go.""""Thank you, I am _so_ glad,"" was Fanny's instinctive reply; though whenshe had turned from him and shut the door, she could not help feeling,""And yet why should I be glad? for am I not certain of seeing or hearingsomething there to pain me?""In spite of this conviction, however, she was glad. Simple as such anengagement might appear in other eyes, it had novelty and importance inhers, for excepting the day at Sotherton, she had scarcely ever dinedout before; and though now going only half a mile, and only to threepeople, still it was dining out, and all the little interests ofpreparation were enjoyments in themselves. She had neither sympathy norassistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings anddirected her taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful toanybody, and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence ofan early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill humour,and seemed intent only on lessening her niece's pleasure, both presentand future, as much as possible.""Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet with such attentionand indulgence! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant forthinking of you, and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought tolook upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are aware thatthere is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort ofway, or ever dining out at all; and it is what you must not depend uponever being repeated. Nor must you be fancying that the invitation ismeant as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment is intendedto your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to_us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have comeinto her head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Juliahad been at home, you would not have been asked at all.""Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant's part ofthe favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could onlysay that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt's evening work in such astate as to prevent her being missed.""Oh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you, or youwould not be allowed to go. _I_ shall be here, so you may be quite easyabout your aunt. And I hope you will have a very _agreeable_ day, andfind it all mighty _delightful_. But I must observe that five is thevery awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and Icannot but be surprised that such an _elegant_ lady as Mrs. Grant shouldnot contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table, too,which fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been contented totake my dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their senses wouldhave done, instead of having that absurd new one of his own, which iswider, literally wider than the dinner-table here, how infinitely betterit would have been! and how much more he would have been respected! forpeople are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere.Remember that, Fanny. Five--only five to be sitting round that table.However, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I dare say.""Mrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.""The nonsense and folly of people's stepping out of their rank andtrying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give _you_a hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of us;and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward, andtalking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins--asif you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia. _That_ will never do, believeme. Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and last; andthough Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you arenot to be taking place of her. And as to coming away at night, you areto stay just as long as Edmund chuses. Leave him to settle _that_.""""Yes, ma'am, I should not think of anything else.""""And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely, for I neversaw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage aswell as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you. Icertainly do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage will notbe out on my account; so you must make up your mind to what may happen,and take your things accordingly.""Her niece thought it perfectly reasonable. She rated her own claimsto comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could; and when Sir Thomas soonafterwards, just opening the door, said, ""Fanny, at what time would youhave the carriage come round?"" she felt a degree of astonishment whichmade it impossible for her to speak.""My dear Sir Thomas!"" cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger, ""Fanny canwalk.""""Walk!"" repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity, andcoming farther into the room. ""My niece walk to a dinner engagement atthis time of the year! Will twenty minutes after four suit you?""""Yes, sir,"" was Fanny's humble answer, given with the feelings almostof a criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with herin what might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out ofthe room, having staid behind him only long enough to hear these wordsspoken in angry agitation--""Quite unnecessary! a great deal too kind! But Edmund goes; true, it isupon Edmund's account. I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night.""But this could not impose on Fanny. She felt that the carriage was forherself, and herself alone: and her uncle's consideration of her, comingimmediately after such representations from her aunt, cost her sometears of gratitude when she was alone.The coachman drove round to a minute; another minute brought down thegentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of beinglate, been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw themoff in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.""Now I must look at you, Fanny,"" said Edmund, with the kind smile of anaffectionate brother, ""and tell you how I like you; and as well as I canjudge by this light, you look very nicely indeed. What have you got on?""""The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin'smarriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it assoon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity allthe winter. I hope you do not think me too fine.""""A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white. No, I see nofinery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seemsvery pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gownsomething the same?""In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard andcoach-house.""Heyday!"" said Edmund, ""here's company, here's a carriage! who have theygot to meet us?"" And letting down the side-glass to distinguish, ""'TisCrawford's, Crawford's barouche, I protest! There are his own two menpushing it back into its old quarters. He is here, of course. This isquite a surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him.""There was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny to say how verydifferently she felt; but the idea of having such another to observeher was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed thevery awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.In the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been just longenough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the smiles and pleased looksof the three others standing round him, shewed how welcome was hissudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath.A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund; and with theexception of Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to _her_ theremight be some advantage in his presence, since every addition to theparty must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered tosit silent and unattended to. She was soon aware of this herself; forthough she must submit, as her own propriety of mind directed, in spiteof her aunt Norris's opinion, to being the principal lady in company,and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she found, whilethey were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, inwhich she was not required to take any part--there was so much to besaid between the brother and sister about Bath, so much between the twoyoung men about hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford andDr. Grant, and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawfordand Mrs. Grant, as to leave her the fairest prospect of having onlyto listen in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day. She could notcompliment the newly arrived gentleman, however, with any appearance ofinterest, in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield, and sendingfor his hunters from Norfolk, which, suggested by Dr. Grant, advised byEdmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters, was soon in possession ofhis mind, and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her toresolve on. Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of theopen weather, but her answers were as short and indifferent as civilityallowed. She could not wish him to stay, and would much rather not havehim speak to her.Her two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her thoughts onseeing him; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _his_ spirits.Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before, andapparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams,as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state. She heard themspoken of by him only in a general way, till they were all re-assembledin the drawing-room, when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter ofbusiness with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them, andMrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table, he began talking of them with moreparticularity to his other sister. With a significant smile, which madeFanny quite hate him, he said, ""So! Rushworth and his fair bride are atBrighton, I understand; happy man!""""Yes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price, have they not?And Julia is with them.""""And Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off.""""Mr. Yates! Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates. I do not imagine hefigures much in the letters to Mansfield Park; do you, Miss Price? Ithink my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr.Yates.""""Poor Rushworth and his two-and-forty speeches!"" continued Crawford.""Nobody can ever forget them. Poor fellow! I see him now--his toil andhis despair. Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever wanthim to make two-and-forty speeches to her""; adding, with a momentaryseriousness, ""She is too good for him--much too good."" And then changinghis tone again to one of gentle gallantry, and addressing Fanny, hesaid, ""You were Mr. Rushworth's best friend. Your kindness and patiencecan never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience in trying to make itpossible for him to learn his part--in trying to give him a brainwhich nature had denied--to mix up an understanding for him out of thesuperfluity of your own! _He_ might not have sense enough himself toestimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it had honour fromall the rest of the party.""Fanny coloured, and said nothing.""It is as a dream, a pleasant dream!"" he exclaimed, breaking forthagain, after a few minutes' musing. ""I shall always look back on ourtheatricals with exquisite pleasure. There was such an interest, such ananimation, such a spirit diffused. Everybody felt it. We were all alive.There was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every hour ofthe day. Always some little objection, some little doubt, some littleanxiety to be got over. I never was happier.""With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself, ""Neverhappier!--never happier than when doing what you must know was notjustifiable!--never happier than when behaving so dishonourably andunfeelingly! Oh! what a corrupted mind!""""We were unlucky, Miss Price,"" he continued, in a lower tone, to avoidthe possibility of being heard by Edmund, and not at all aware of herfeelings, ""we certainly were very unlucky. Another week, only one otherweek, would have been enough for us. I think if we had had the disposalof events--if Mansfield Park had had the government of the windsjust for a week or two, about the equinox, there would have beena difference. Not that we would have endangered his safety by anytremendous weather--but only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm. Ithink, Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week's calmin the Atlantic at that season.""He seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny, averting her face, said,with a firmer tone than usual, ""As far as _I_ am concerned, sir, I wouldnot have delayed his return for a day. My uncle disapproved it all soentirely when he did arrive, that in my opinion everything had gonequite far enough.""She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before, andnever so angrily to any one; and when her speech was over, she trembledand blushed at her own daring. He was surprised; but after a fewmoments' silent consideration of her, replied in a calmer, graver tone,and as if the candid result of conviction, ""I believe you are right.It was more pleasant than prudent. We were getting too noisy."" Andthen turning the conversation, he would have engaged her on some othersubject, but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could notadvance in any.Miss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund,now observed, ""Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point todiscuss.""""The most interesting in the world,"" replied her brother--""how to makemoney; how to turn a good income into a better. Dr. Grant is givingBertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon. I findhe takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the dining-parlour. Iam glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He will have a very prettyincome to make ducks and drakes with, and earned without much trouble. Iapprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year. Seven hundreda year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of course he willstill live at home, it will be all for his _menus_ _plaisirs_; and asermon at Christmas and Easter, I suppose, will be the sum total ofsacrifice.""His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying, ""Nothing amuses memore than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance ofthose who have a great deal less than themselves. You would look ratherblank, Henry, if your _menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to sevenhundred a year.""""Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative.Birthright and habit must settle the business. Bertram is certainly welloff for a cadet of even a baronet's family. By the time he is four orfive and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do forit.""Miss Crawford _could_ have said that there would be a something to doand to suffer for it, which she could not think lightly of; but shechecked herself and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcernedwhen the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.""Bertram,"" said Henry Crawford, ""I shall make a point of coming toMansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purposeto encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will notyou join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attendwith your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time--as I shall do--notto lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentencepreeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and apencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, thatSir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.""""I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,"" said Edmund;""for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be moresorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.""""Will he not feel this?"" thought Fanny. ""No, he can feel nothing as heought.""The party being now all united, and the chief talkers attracting eachother, she remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formedafter tea--formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by hisattentive wife, though it was not to be supposed so--and Miss Crawfordtook her harp, she had nothing to do but to listen; and her tranquillityremained undisturbed the rest of the evening, except when Mr. Crawfordnow and then addressed to her a question or observation, which she couldnot avoid answering. Miss Crawford was too much vexed by what had passedto be in a humour for anything but music. With that she soothed herselfand amused her friend.The assurance of Edmund's being so soon to take orders, coming upon herlike a blow that had been suspended, and still hoped uncertain and at adistance, was felt with resentment and mortification. She was very angrywith him. She had thought her influence more. She _had_ begun to thinkof him; she felt that she had, with great regard, with almost decidedintentions; but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings. Itwas plain that he could have no serious views, no true attachment, byfixing himself in a situation which he must know she would neverstoop to. She would learn to match him in his indifference. She wouldhenceforth admit his attentions without any idea beyond immediateamusement. If _he_ could so command his affections, _hers_ should do herno harm."
Mansfield Park,24,"CHAPTER XXIVHenry Crawford had quite made up his mind by the next morning to giveanother fortnight to Mansfield, and having sent for his hunters, andwritten a few lines of explanation to the Admiral, he looked round athis sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him, and seeing thecoast clear of the rest of the family, said, with a smile, ""And how doyou think I mean to amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt?I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week; but I have aplan for the intermediate days, and what do you think it is?""""To walk and ride with me, to be sure.""""Not exactly, though I shall be happy to do both, but _that_ would beexercise only to my body, and I must take care of my mind. Besides,_that_ would be all recreation and indulgence, without the wholesomealloy of labour, and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness. No, myplan is to make Fanny Price in love with me.""""Fanny Price! Nonsense! No, no. You ought to be satisfied with her twocousins.""""But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a smallhole in Fanny Price's heart. You do not seem properly aware of herclaims to notice. When we talked of her last night, you none of youseemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in herlooks within the last six weeks. You see her every day, and therefore donot notice it; but I assure you she is quite a different creature fromwhat she was in the autumn. She was then merely a quiet, modest, notplain-looking girl, but she is now absolutely pretty. I used to thinkshe had neither complexion nor countenance; but in that soft skin ofhers, so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday, there isdecided beauty; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth, I donot despair of their being capable of expression enough when shehas anything to express. And then, her air, her manner, her _tout__ensemble_, is so indescribably improved! She must be grown two inches,at least, since October.""""Phoo! phoo! This is only because there were no tall women to compareher with, and because she has got a new gown, and you never saw her sowell dressed before. She is just what she was in October, believe me.The truth is, that she was the only girl in company for you to notice,and you must have a somebody. I have always thought her pretty--notstrikingly pretty--but 'pretty enough,' as people say; a sort of beautythat grows on one. Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile;but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may allbe resolved into a better style of dress, and your having nobody else tolook at; and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her, younever will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty, or thatit proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly.""Her brother gave only a smile to this accusation, and soon afterwardssaid, ""I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny. I do notunderstand her. I could not tell what she would be at yesterday. What isher character? Is she solemn? Is she queer? Is she prudish? Why did shedraw back and look so grave at me? I could hardly get her to speak. Inever was so long in company with a girl in my life, trying to entertainher, and succeed so ill! Never met with a girl who looked so grave onme! I must try to get the better of this. Her looks say, 'I will notlike you, I am determined not to like you'; and I say she shall.""""Foolish fellow! And so this is her attraction after all! This it is,her not caring about you, which gives her such a soft skin, and makesher so much taller, and produces all these charms and graces! I dodesire that you will not be making her really unhappy; a _little_ love,perhaps, may animate and do her good, but I will not have you plungeher deep, for she is as good a little creature as ever lived, and has agreat deal of feeling.""""It can be but for a fortnight,"" said Henry; ""and if a fortnight cankill her, she must have a constitution which nothing could save. No, Iwill not do her any harm, dear little soul! only want her to look kindlyon me, to give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair for me byherself wherever we are, and be all animation when I take it and talkto her; to think as I think, be interested in all my possessions andpleasures, try to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I go awaythat she shall be never happy again. I want nothing more.""""Moderation itself!"" said Mary. ""I can have no scruples now. Well, youwill have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself,for we are a great deal together.""And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny toher fate, a fate which, had not Fanny's heart been guarded in a wayunsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than shedeserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable youngladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are neverto be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent,manner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination tobelieve Fanny one of them, or to think that with so much tendernessof disposition, and so much taste as belonged to her, she could haveescaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the courtship only ofa fortnight) of such a man as Crawford, in spite of there being someprevious ill opinion of him to be overcome, had not her affection beenengaged elsewhere. With all the security which love of another anddisesteem of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking,his continued attentions--continued, but not obtrusive, and adaptingthemselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of hercharacter--obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly. Shehad by no means forgotten the past, and she thought as ill of him asever; but she felt his powers: he was entertaining; and his manners wereso improved, so polite, so seriously and blamelessly polite, that it wasimpossible not to be civil to him in return.A very few days were enough to effect this; and at the end of those fewdays, circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward hisviews of pleasing her, inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happinesswhich must dispose her to be pleased with everybody. William, herbrother, the so long absent and dearly loved brother, was in Englandagain. She had a letter from him herself, a few hurried happy lines,written as the ship came up Channel, and sent into Portsmouth withthe first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead; and whenCrawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand, which he had hopedwould bring the first tidings, he found her trembling with joy over thisletter, and listening with a glowing, grateful countenance to the kindinvitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply.It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughlymaster of the subject, or had in fact become at all aware of her havingsuch a brother, or his being in such a ship, but the interest thenexcited had been very properly lively, determining him on his return totown to apply for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp'sreturn from the Mediterranean, etc.; and the good luck which attendedhis early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward ofhis ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her, as well asof his dutiful attention to the Admiral, in having for many yearstaken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence. Heproved, however, to be too late. All those fine first feelings, of whichhe had hoped to be the exciter, were already given. But his intention,the kindness of his intention, was thankfully acknowledged: quitethankfully and warmly, for she was elevated beyond the common timidityof her mind by the flow of her love for William.This dear William would soon be amongst them. There could be no doubtof his obtaining leave of absence immediately, for he was still only amidshipman; and as his parents, from living on the spot, must alreadyhave seen him, and be seeing him perhaps daily, his direct holidaysmight with justice be instantly given to the sister, who had been hisbest correspondent through a period of seven years, and the uncle whohad done most for his support and advancement; and accordingly the replyto her reply, fixing a very early day for his arrival, came as soon aspossible; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been inthe agitation of her first dinner-visit, when she found herself in anagitation of a higher nature, watching in the hall, in the lobby, onthe stairs, for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her abrother.It came happily while she was thus waiting; and there being neitherceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting, she was withhim as he entered the house, and the first minutes of exquisite feelinghad no interruption and no witnesses, unless the servants chiefly intentupon opening the proper doors could be called such. This was exactlywhat Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at, as eachproved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they bothadvised Mrs. Norris's continuing where she was, instead of rushing outinto the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them.William and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas had thepleasure of receiving, in his protege, certainly a very different personfrom the one he had equipped seven years ago, but a young man of anopen, pleasant countenance, and frank, unstudied, but feeling andrespectful manners, and such as confirmed him his friend.It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness ofsuch an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation,and the first of fruition; it was some time even before her happinesscould be said to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparablefrom the alteration of person had vanished, and she could see in him thesame William as before, and talk to him, as her heart had been yearningto do through many a past year. That time, however, did gradually come,forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own, and much lessencumbered by refinement or self-distrust. She was the first objectof his love, but it was a love which his stronger spirits, and boldertemper, made it as natural for him to express as to feel. On themorrow they were walking about together with true enjoyment, and everysucceeding morrow renewed a _tete-a-tete_ which Sir Thomas could not butobserve with complacency, even before Edmund had pointed it out to him.Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked orunlooked-for instance of Edmund's consideration of her in the last fewmonths had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life,as in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother andfriend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopesand fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,dearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could giveher direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers andsisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all thecomforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield; ready tothink of every member of that home as she directed, or differing onlyby a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of their aunt Norris,and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the whole) all the eviland good of their earliest years could be gone over again, and everyformer united pain and pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection.An advantage this, a strengthener of love, in which even the conjugaltie is beneath the fraternal. Children of the same family, the sameblood, with the same first associations and habits, have some means ofenjoyment in their power, which no subsequent connexions can supply; andit must be by a long and unnatural estrangement, by a divorce whichno subsequent connexion can justify, if such precious remains of theearliest attachments are ever entirely outlived. Too often, alas! it isso. Fraternal love, sometimes almost everything, is at others worse thannothing. But with William and Fanny Price it was still a sentimentin all its prime and freshness, wounded by no opposition of interest,cooled by no separate attachment, and feeling the influence of time andabsence only in its increase.An affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who hadhearts to value anything good. Henry Crawford was as much struck withit as any. He honoured the warm-hearted, blunt fondness of the youngsailor, which led him to say, with his hands stretched towards Fanny'shead, ""Do you know, I begin to like that queer fashion already, thoughwhen I first heard of such things being done in England, I couldnot believe it; and when Mrs. Brown, and the other women at theCommissioner's at Gibraltar, appeared in the same trim, I thought theywere mad; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything""; and saw, with livelyadmiration, the glow of Fanny's cheek, the brightness of her eye, thedeep interest, the absorbed attention, while her brother was describingany of the imminent hazards, or terrific scenes, which such a period atsea must supply.It was a picture which Henry Crawford had moral taste enough to value.Fanny's attractions increased--increased twofold; for the sensibilitywhich beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was anattraction in itself. He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities ofher heart. She had feeling, genuine feeling. It would be something tobe loved by such a girl, to excite the first ardours of her youngunsophisticated mind! She interested him more than he had foreseen. Afortnight was not enough. His stay became indefinite.William was often called on by his uncle to be the talker. His recitalswere amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas, but the chief object inseeking them was to understand the reciter, to know the young man by hishistories; and he listened to his clear, simple, spirited detailswith full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles,professional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness, everythingthat could deserve or promise well. Young as he was, William had alreadyseen a great deal. He had been in the Mediterranean; in the West Indies;in the Mediterranean again; had been often taken on shore by the favourof his captain, and in the course of seven years had known every varietyof danger which sea and war together could offer. With such means inhis power he had a right to be listened to; and though Mrs. Norris couldfidget about the room, and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefulsof thread or a second-hand shirt button, in the midst of her nephew'saccount of a shipwreck or an engagement, everybody else was attentive;and even Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved, orwithout sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say, ""Dear me! howdisagreeable! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea.""To Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling. He longed to have beenat sea, and seen and done and suffered as much. His heart was warmed,his fancy fired, and he felt the highest respect for a lad who, beforehe was twenty, had gone through such bodily hardships and given suchproofs of mind. The glory of heroism, of usefulness, of exertion, ofendurance, made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shamefulcontrast; and he wished he had been a William Price, distinguishinghimself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so muchself-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he was!The wish was rather eager than lasting. He was roused from the reverieof retrospection and regret produced by it, by some inquiry from Edmundas to his plans for the next day's hunting; and he found it was as wellto be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command.In one respect it was better, as it gave him the means of conferring akindness where he wished to oblige. With spirits, courage, and curiosityup to anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and Crawfordcould mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself, and withonly some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew better than hisnephew the value of such a loan, and some alarms to reason away inFanny. She feared for William; by no means convinced by all that hecould relate of his own horsemanship in various countries, of thescrambling parties in which he had been engaged, the rough horses andmules he had ridden, or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls,that he was at all equal to the management of a high-fed hunter in anEnglish fox-chase; nor till he returned safe and well, without accidentor discredit, could she be reconciled to the risk, or feel any of thatobligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fullyintended it should produce. When it was proved, however, to have doneWilliam no harm, she could allow it to be a kindness, and even rewardthe owner with a smile when the animal was one minute tendered to hisuse again; and the next, with the greatest cordiality, and in a mannernot to be resisted, made over to his use entirely so long as he remainedin Northamptonshire.

Mansfield Park,25,"CHAPTER XXVThe intercourse of the two families was at this period more nearlyrestored to what it had been in the autumn, than any member of theold intimacy had thought ever likely to be again. The return of HenryCrawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it,but much was still owing to Sir Thomas's more than toleration of theneighbourly attempts at the Parsonage. His mind, now disengaged fromthe cares which had pressed on him at first, was at leisure to findthe Grants and their young inmates really worth visiting; and thoughinfinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageousmatrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent possibilitiesof any one most dear to him, and disdaining even as a littleness thebeing quick-sighted on such points, he could not avoid perceiving, ina grand and careless way, that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishinghis niece--nor perhaps refrain (though unconsciously) from giving a morewilling assent to invitations on that account.His readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when thegeneral invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and manydoubts as to whether it were worth while, ""because Sir Thomas seemedso ill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!"" proceeded fromgood-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr.Crawford, but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in thecourse of that very visit that he first began to think that any one inthe habit of such idle observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr.Crawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one, being composed in agood proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen;and the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usualstyle of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits ofall to raise any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never beholdeither the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience, andwho did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of theservants behind her chair, and to bring away some fresh conviction ofits being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.In the evening it was found, according to the predetermination of Mrs.Grant and her sister, that after making up the whist-table there wouldremain sufficient for a round game, and everybody being as perfectlycomplying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist; and Lady Bertramsoon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for herown choice between the games, and being required either to draw a cardfor whist or not. She hesitated. Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.""What shall I do, Sir Thomas? Whist and speculation; which will amuse memost?""Sir Thomas, after a moment's thought, recommended speculation. He wasa whist player himself, and perhaps might feel that it would not muchamuse him to have her for a partner.""Very well,"" was her ladyship's contented answer; ""then speculation, ifyou please, Mrs. Grant. I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teachme.""Here Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her ownequal ignorance; she had never played the game nor seen it played inher life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment's indecision again; but uponeverybody's assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it was theeasiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford's stepping forward with amost earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and MissPrice, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.Norris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of primeintellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss Crawford'sdirection, were arranged round the other. It was a fine arrangementfor Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his hands full ofbusiness, having two persons' cards to manage as well as his own; forthough it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of therules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to inspirit her play,sharpen her avarice, and harden her heart, which, especially in anycompetition with William, was a work of some difficulty; and as for LadyBertram, he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune throughthe whole evening; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at hercards when the deal began, must direct her in whatever was to be donewith them to the end of it.He was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease, and preeminentin all the lively turns, quick resources, and playful impudence thatcould do honour to the game; and the round table was altogether a verycomfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of theother.Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of hislady, but in vain; no pause was long enough for the time his measuredmanner needed; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs.Grant was able, at the end of the first rubber, to go to her and pay hercompliments.""I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game.""""Oh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed. A very odd game. I do not knowwhat it is all about. I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford doesall the rest.""""Bertram,"" said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the opportunityof a little languor in the game, ""I have never told you what happened tome yesterday in my ride home."" They had been hunting together, and werein the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield, whenhis horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had beenobliged to give up, and make the best of his way back. ""I told you Ilost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees, becauseI can never bear to ask; but I have not told you that, with my usualluck--for I never do wrong without gaining by it--I found myself in duetime in the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was suddenly,upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the midst ofa retired little village between gently rising hills; a small streambefore me to be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to myright--which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place, andnot a gentleman or half a gentleman's house to be seen excepting one--tobe presumed the Parsonage--within a stone's throw of the said knoll andchurch. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey.""""It sounds like it,"" said Edmund; ""but which way did you turn afterpassing Sewell's farm?""""I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions; though were I toanswer all that you could put in the course of an hour, you would neverbe able to prove that it was _not_ Thornton Lacey--for such it certainlywas.""""You inquired, then?""""No, I never inquire. But I _told_ a man mending a hedge that it wasThornton Lacey, and he agreed to it.""""You have a good memory. I had forgotten having ever told you half somuch of the place.""Thornton Lacey was the name of his impending living, as Miss Crawfordwell knew; and her interest in a negotiation for William Price's knaveincreased.""Well,"" continued Edmund, ""and how did you like what you saw?""""Very much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There will be work for fivesummers at least before the place is liveable.""""No, no, not so bad as that. The farmyard must be moved, I grant you;but I am not aware of anything else. The house is by no means bad, andwhen the yard is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach to it.""""The farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted up to shutout the blacksmith's shop. The house must be turned to front the eastinstead of the north--the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must beon that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may bedone. And _there_ must be your approach, through what is at present thegarden. You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house;which will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to thesouth-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty yardsup the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look aboutme; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The meadowsbeyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well as what now _is_, sweepinground from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to theprincipal road through the village, must be all laid together, ofcourse; very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber. Theybelong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must purchase them. Thenthe stream--something must be done with the stream; but I could notquite determine what. I had two or three ideas.""""And I have two or three ideas also,"" said Edmund, ""and one of them is,that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put inpractice. I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. Ithink the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the airof a gentleman's residence, without any very heavy expense, and thatmust suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me.""Miss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone ofvoice, and a certain half-look attending the last expression of hishope, made a hasty finish of her dealings with William Price; andsecuring his knave at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, ""There, I willstake my last like a woman of spirit. No cold prudence for me. I am notborn to sit still and do nothing. If I lose the game, it shall not befrom not striving for it.""The game was hers, and only did not pay her for what she had givento secure it. Another deal proceeded, and Crawford began again aboutThornton Lacey.""My plan may not be the best possible: I had not many minutes to formit in; but you must do a good deal. The place deserves it, and youwill find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of.(Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them liejust before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving itthe air of a gentleman's residence. _That_ will be done by the removalof the farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never sawa house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of agentleman's residence, so much the look of a something above a mereparsonage-house--above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It isnot a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofsas windows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a squarefarmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such asone might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in fromgeneration to generation, through two centuries at least, and were nowspending from two to three thousand a year in."" Miss Crawford listened,and Edmund agreed to this. ""The air of a gentleman's residence,therefore, you cannot but give it, if you do anything. But it is capableof much more. (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for thatqueen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does notbid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By somesuch improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you toproceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody's striking outa better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it intoa _place_. From being the mere gentleman's residence, it becomes, byjudicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste,modern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and thathouse receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as thegreat landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road;especially as there is no real squire's house to dispute the point--acircumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such asituation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation._You_ think with me, I hope"" (turning with a softened voice to Fanny).""Have you ever seen the place?""Fanny gave a quick negative, and tried to hide her interest in thesubject by an eager attention to her brother, who was driving as hard abargain, and imposing on her as much as he could; but Crawford pursuedwith ""No, no, you must not part with the queen. You have bought her toodearly, and your brother does not offer half her value. No, no, sir,hands off, hands off. Your sister does not part with the queen. She isquite determined. The game will be yours,"" turning to her again; ""itwill certainly be yours.""""And Fanny had much rather it were William's,"" said Edmund, smiling ather. ""Poor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes!""""Mr. Bertram,"" said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards, ""you knowHenry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage inanything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help. Onlythink how useful he was at Sotherton! Only think what grand things wereproduced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to driveabout the grounds, and see his genius take fire. There we went, andthere we came home again; and what was done there is not to be told!""Fanny's eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expressionmore than grave--even reproachful; but on catching his, were instantlywithdrawn. With something of consciousness he shook his head at hissister, and laughingly replied, ""I cannot say there was much done atSotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after eachother, and bewildered."" As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter, headded, in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, ""I should be sorry tohave my powers of _planning_ judged of by the day at Sotherton. I seethings very differently now. Do not think of me as I appeared then.""Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in thehappy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas'scapital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant's great hands,she called out, in high good-humour, ""Sotherton! Yes, that is a place,indeed, and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out ofluck; but the next time you come, I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworthwill be at home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindlyreceived by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget theirrelations, and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at Brightonnow, you know; in one of the best houses there, as Mr. Rushworth's finefortune gives them a right to be. I do not exactly know the distance,but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not very far off, youought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I could send alittle parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins.""""I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;and if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such asmart place as that--poor scrubby midshipman as I am.""Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he mightdepend on, when she was stopped by Sir Thomas's saying with authority,""I do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you maysoon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughterswould be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of ourfamily as his own.""""I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord thananything else,"" was William's only answer, in an undervoice, not meantto reach far, and the subject dropped.As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford'sbehaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the secondrubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their lastplay, he became a looker-on at the other, he found his niece theobject of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointedcharacter.Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about ThorntonLacey; and not being able to catch Edmund's ear, was detailing it to hisfair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness. His scheme wasto rent the house himself the following winter, that he might have ahome of his own in that neighbourhood; and it was not merely for the useof it in the hunting-season (as he was then telling her), though _that_consideration had certainly some weight, feeling as he did that, inspite of all Dr. Grant's very great kindness, it was impossible for himand his horses to be accommodated where they now were without materialinconvenience; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not dependupon one amusement or one season of the year: he had set his heart uponhaving a something there that he could come to at any time, a littlehomestall at his command, where all the holidays of his year might bespent, and he might find himself continuing, improving, and _perfecting_that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park family which wasincreasing in value to him every day. Sir Thomas heard and was notoffended. There was no want of respect in the young man's address;and Fanny's reception of it was so proper and modest, so calm anduninviting, that he had nothing to censure in her. She said little,assented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination either ofappropriating any part of the compliment to herself, or of strengtheninghis views in favour of Northamptonshire. Finding by whom he wasobserved, Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject to SirThomas, in a more everyday tone, but still with feeling.""I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have, perhaps, heard metelling Miss Price. May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your notinfluencing your son against such a tenant?""Sir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, ""It is the only way, sir, in whichI could _not_ wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but I hope,and believe, that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey.Edmund, am I saying too much?""Edmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on; but, onunderstanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.""Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But, Crawford, thoughI refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house ashalf your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your ownimproved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan thatmay occur to you this spring.""""We shall be the losers,"" continued Sir Thomas. ""His going, though onlyeight miles, will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle; butI should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcilehimself to doing less. It is perfectly natural that you should not havethought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford. But a parish has wants andclaims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, andwhich no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent. Edmundmight, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he mightread prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might rideover every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through divineservice; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day,for three or four hours, if that would content him. But it will not.He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon canconvey; and that if he does not live among his parishioners, and provehimself, by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend, he doesvery little either for their good or his own.""Mr. Crawford bowed his acquiescence.""I repeat again,"" added Sir Thomas, ""that Thornton Lacey is the onlyhouse in the neighbourhood in which I should _not_ be happy to wait onMr. Crawford as occupier.""Mr. Crawford bowed his thanks.""Sir Thomas,"" said Edmund, ""undoubtedly understands the duty of a parishpriest. We must hope his son may prove that _he_ knows it too.""Whatever effect Sir Thomas's little harangue might really produce on Mr.Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others, twoof his most attentive listeners--Miss Crawford and Fanny. One ofwhom, having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and socompletely to be his home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what itwould be _not_ to see Edmund every day; and the other, startled from theagreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength ofher brother's description, no longer able, in the picture she hadbeen forming of a future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink theclergyman, and see only the respectable, elegant, modernised, andoccasional residence of a man of independent fortune, was consideringSir Thomas, with decided ill-will, as the destroyer of all this, andsuffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his characterand manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve herself by a singleattempt at throwing ridicule on his cause.All the agreeable of _her_ speculation was over for that hour. It wastime to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed; and she was glad tofind it necessary to come to a conclusion, and be able to refresh herspirits by a change of place and neighbour.The chief of the party were now collected irregularly round thefire, and waiting the final break-up. William and Fanny were the mostdetached. They remained together at the otherwise deserted card-table,talking very comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some of therest began to think of them. Henry Crawford's chair was the first to begiven a direction towards them, and he sat silently observing them for afew minutes; himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir Thomas, who wasstanding in chat with Dr. Grant.""This is the assembly night,"" said William. ""If I were at Portsmouth Ishould be at it, perhaps.""""But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?""""No, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and ofdancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there wouldbe any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner.The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not acommission. One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One _is_nothing, indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazingfine girls, but they will hardly speak to _me_, because Lucy is courtedby a lieutenant.""""Oh! shame, shame! But never mind it, William"" (her own cheeks in aglow of indignation as she spoke). ""It is not worth minding. It is noreflection on _you_; it is no more than what the greatest admirals haveall experienced, more or less, in their time. You must think of that,you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships whichfall to every sailor's share, like bad weather and hard living, onlywith this advantage, that there will be an end to it, that there willcome a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When youare a lieutenant! only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, howlittle you will care for any nonsense of this kind.""""I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny. Everybody getsmade but me.""""Oh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding. My unclesays nothing, but I am sure he will do everything in his power to getyou made. He knows, as well as you do, of what consequence it is.""She was checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer to them than shehad any suspicion of, and each found it necessary to talk of somethingelse.""Are you fond of dancing, Fanny?""""Yes, very; only I am soon tired.""""I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have younever any balls at Northampton? I should like to see you dance, and I'ddance with you if you _would_, for nobody would know who I was here,and I should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump abouttogether many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the street?I am a pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better.""And turning to his uncle, who was now close to them, ""Is not Fanny avery good dancer, sir?""Fanny, in dismay at such an unprecedented question, did not know whichway to look, or how to be prepared for the answer. Some very gravereproof, or at least the coldest expression of indifference, must becoming to distress her brother, and sink her to the ground. But, on thecontrary, it was no worse than, ""I am sorry to say that I am unableto answer your question. I have never seen Fanny dance since she was alittle girl; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself likea gentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may have anopportunity of doing ere long.""""I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. Price,""said Henry Crawford, leaning forward, ""and will engage to answer everyinquiry which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction.But I believe"" (seeing Fanny looked distressed) ""it must be at someother time. There is _one_ person in company who does not like to haveMiss Price spoken of.""True enough, he had once seen Fanny dance; and it was equally truethat he would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet, lightelegance, and in admirable time; but, in fact, he could not for the lifeof him recall what her dancing had been, and rather took it for grantedthat she had been present than remembered anything about her.He passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing; and Sir Thomas, by nomeans displeased, prolonged the conversation on dancing in general, andwas so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and listening towhat his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing whichhad fallen within his observation, that he had not heard his carriageannounced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle ofMrs. Norris.""Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about? We are going. Do not you seeyour aunt is going? Quick, quick! I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcoxwaiting. You should always remember the coachman and horses. My dear SirThomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you,and Edmund and William.""Sir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his own arrangement,previously communicated to his wife and sister; but _that_ seemedforgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she settled it allherself.Fanny's last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawlwhich Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put roundher shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford's quicker hand, and she wasobliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention."
Mansfield Park,26,"CHAPTER XXVIWilliam's desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentaryimpression on his uncle. The hope of an opportunity, which Sir Thomashad then given, was not given to be thought of no more. He remainedsteadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybodyelse who might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to theyoung people in general; and having thought the matter over, and takenhis resolution in quiet independence, the result of it appeared thenext morning at breakfast, when, after recalling and commending whathis nephew had said, he added, ""I do not like, William, that youshould leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence. It would give mepleasure to see you both dance. You spoke of the balls at Northampton.Your cousins have occasionally attended them; but they would notaltogether suit us now. The fatigue would be too much for your aunt. Ibelieve we must not think of a Northampton ball. A dance at home wouldbe more eligible; and if--""""Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!"" interrupted Mrs. Norris, ""I knew what wascoming. I knew what you were going to say. If dear Julia were at home,or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasionfor such a thing, you would be tempted to give the young people a danceat Mansfield. I know you would. If _they_ were at home to grace theball, a ball you would have this very Christmas. Thank your uncle,William, thank your uncle!""""My daughters,"" replied Sir Thomas, gravely interposing, ""have theirpleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy; but the dance which Ithink of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins. Could we be allassembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but theabsence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.""Mrs. Norris had not another word to say. She saw decision in his looks,and her surprise and vexation required some minutes' silence to besettled into composure. A ball at such a time! His daughters absent andherself not consulted! There was comfort, however, soon at hand. _She_must be the doer of everything: Lady Bertram would of course be sparedall thought and exertion, and it would all fall upon _her_. She shouldhave to do the honours of the evening; and this reflection quicklyrestored so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join in with theothers, before their happiness and thanks were all expressed.Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speakas much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas coulddesire. Edmund's feelings were for the other two. His father had neverconferred a favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction.Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented, and had noobjections to make. Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very littletrouble; and she assured him ""that she was not at all afraid of thetrouble; indeed, she could not imagine there would be any.""Mrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he wouldthink fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged; and when shewould have conjectured and hinted about the day, it appeared that theday was settled too. Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping avery complete outline of the business; and as soon as she would listenquietly, could read his list of the families to be invited, from whomhe calculated, with all necessary allowance for the shortness of thenotice, to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteencouple: and could detail the considerations which had induced him tofix on the 22nd as the most eligible day. William was required to be atPortsmouth on the 24th; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of hisvisit; but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on anyearlier. Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just thesame, and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself,as by far the best day for the purpose.The ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening a proclaimedthing to all whom it concerned. Invitations were sent with despatch,and many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of happycares as well as Fanny. To her the cares were sometimes almost beyondthe happiness; for young and inexperienced, with small means of choiceand no confidence in her own taste, the ""how she should be dressed"" wasa point of painful solicitude; and the almost solitary ornament in herpossession, a very pretty amber cross which William had brought her fromSicily, was the greatest distress of all, for she had nothing but a bitof ribbon to fasten it to; and though she had worn it in that manneronce, would it be allowable at such a time in the midst of all the richornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies would appear in?And yet not to wear it! William had wanted to buy her a gold chain too,but the purchase had been beyond his means, and therefore not to wearthe cross might be mortifying him. These were anxious considerations;enough to sober her spirits even under the prospect of a ball givenprincipally for her gratification.The preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued to sit onher sofa without any inconvenience from them. She had some extra visitsfrom the housekeeper, and her maid was rather hurried in making up a newdress for her: Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran about; butall this gave _her_ no trouble, and as she had foreseen, ""there was, infact, no trouble in the business.""Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind beingdeeply occupied in the consideration of two important events nowat hand, which were to fix his fate in life--ordination andmatrimony--events of such a serious character as to make the ball, whichwould be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment inhis eyes than in those of any other person in the house. On the 23rdhe was going to a friend near Peterborough, in the same situationas himself, and they were to receive ordination in the course of theChristmas week. Half his destiny would then be determined, but theother half might not be so very smoothly wooed. His duties would beestablished, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and rewardthose duties, might yet be unattainable. He knew his own mind, but hewas not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford's. There werepoints on which they did not quite agree; there were moments in whichshe did not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to heraffection, so far as to be resolved--almost resolved--on bringing it toa decision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of businessbefore him were arranged, and he knew what he had to offer her, hehad many anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result. Hisconviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong; he couldlook back on a long course of encouragement, and she was as perfect indisinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other timesdoubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought ofher acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decidedpreference of a London life, what could he expect but a determinedrejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated,demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side asconscience must forbid.The issue of all depended on one question. Did she love him well enoughto forego what had used to be essential points? Did she love him wellenough to make them no longer essential? And this question, which he wascontinually repeating to himself, though oftenest answered with a ""Yes,""had sometimes its ""No.""Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield, and on this circumstance the""no"" and the ""yes"" had been very recently in alternation. He had seenher eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend's letter, which claimeda long visit from her in London, and of the kindness of Henry, inengaging to remain where he was till January, that he might convey herthither; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey withan animation which had ""no"" in every tone. But this had occurred on thefirst day of its being settled, within the first hour of the burst ofsuch enjoyment, when nothing but the friends she was to visit was beforeher. He had since heard her express herself differently, with otherfeelings, more chequered feelings: he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant thatshe should leave her with regret; that she began to believe neither thefriends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she leftbehind; and that though she felt she must go, and knew she should enjoyherself when once away, she was already looking forward to being atMansfield again. Was there not a ""yes"" in all this?With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, Edmundcould not, on his own account, think very much of the evening which therest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree ofstrong interest. Independent of his two cousins' enjoyment in it, theevening was to him of no higher value than any other appointed meetingof the two families might be. In every meeting there was a hope ofreceiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford's attachment; but thewhirl of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to theexcitement or expression of serious feelings. To engage her early forthe two first dances was all the command of individual happiness whichhe felt in his power, and the only preparation for the ball which hecould enter into, in spite of all that was passing around him on thesubject, from morning till night.Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, stillunable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined toseek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant andher sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless;and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she had reasonto think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the Parsonagewithout much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion;and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it toFanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own solicitude.She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage, just settingout to call on her, and as it seemed to her that her friend, thoughobliged to insist on turning back, was unwilling to lose her walk, sheexplained her business at once, and observed, that if she would be sokind as to give her opinion, it might be all talked over as well withoutdoors as within. Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the application,and after a moment's thought, urged Fanny's returning with her in a muchmore cordial manner than before, and proposed their going up into herroom, where they might have a comfortable coze, without disturbing Dr.and Mrs. Grant, who were together in the drawing-room. It was just theplan to suit Fanny; and with a great deal of gratitude on her side forsuch ready and kind attention, they proceeded indoors, and upstairs, andwere soon deep in the interesting subject. Miss Crawford, pleased withthe appeal, gave her all her best judgment and taste, made everythingeasy by her suggestions, and tried to make everything agreeable by herencouragement. The dress being settled in all its grander parts--""Butwhat shall you have by way of necklace?"" said Miss Crawford. ""Shall notyou wear your brother's cross?"" And as she spoke she was undoing asmall parcel, which Fanny had observed in her hand when they met. Fannyacknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point: she did not knowhow either to wear the cross, or to refrain from wearing it. She wasanswered by having a small trinket-box placed before her, and beingrequested to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces. Suchhad been the parcel with which Miss Crawford was provided, and such theobject of her intended visit: and in the kindest manner she now urgedFanny's taking one for the cross and to keep for her sake, sayingeverything she could think of to obviate the scruples which were makingFanny start back at first with a look of horror at the proposal.""You see what a collection I have,"" said she; ""more by half than I everuse or think of. I do not offer them as new. I offer nothing but an oldnecklace. You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me.""Fanny still resisted, and from her heart. The gift was too valuable. ButMiss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much affectionateearnestness through all the heads of William and the cross, and theball, and herself, as to be finally successful. Fanny foundherself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused of prideor indifference, or some other littleness; and having with modestreluctance given her consent, proceeded to make the selection. Shelooked and looked, longing to know which might be least valuable; andwas determined in her choice at last, by fancying there was one necklacemore frequently placed before her eyes than the rest. It was of gold,prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a longer and aplainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped, in fixingon this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep. MissCrawford smiled her perfect approbation; and hastened to complete thegift by putting the necklace round her, and making her see how wellit looked. Fanny had not a word to say against its becomingness, and,excepting what remained of her scruples, was exceedingly pleased withan acquisition so very apropos. She would rather, perhaps, have beenobliged to some other person. But this was an unworthy feeling. MissCrawford had anticipated her wants with a kindness which proved her areal friend. ""When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you,""said she, ""and feel how very kind you were.""""You must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace,""replied Miss Crawford. ""You must think of Henry, for it was his choicein the first place. He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make overto you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to bea family remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your mind withoutbringing the brother too.""Fanny, in great astonishment and confusion, would have returned thepresent instantly. To take what had been the gift of another person,of a brother too, impossible! it must not be! and with an eagernessand embarrassment quite diverting to her companion, she laid down thenecklace again on its cotton, and seemed resolved either to take anotheror none at all. Miss Crawford thought she had never seen a prettierconsciousness. ""My dear child,"" said she, laughing, ""what are you afraidof? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine, and fancy youdid not come honestly by it? or are you imagining he would be too muchflattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his moneypurchased three years ago, before he knew there was such a throat in theworld? or perhaps""--looking archly--""you suspect a confederacy betweenus, and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at hisdesire?""With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought.""Well, then,"" replied Miss Crawford more seriously, but without at allbelieving her, ""to convince me that you suspect no trick, and are asunsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you, take the necklaceand say no more about it. Its being a gift of my brother's need not makethe smallest difference in your accepting it, as I assure you it makesnone in my willingness to part with it. He is always giving me somethingor other. I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quiteimpossible for me to value or for him to remember half. And as for thisnecklace, I do not suppose I have worn it six times: it is very pretty,but I never think of it; and though you would be most heartily welcometo any other in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on the veryone which, if I have a choice, I would rather part with and see in yourpossession than any other. Say no more against it, I entreat you. Such atrifle is not worth half so many words.""Fanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with renewed but lesshappy thanks accepted the necklace again, for there was an expression inMiss Crawford's eyes which she could not be satisfied with.It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford's change ofmanners. She had long seen it. He evidently tried to please her: he wasgallant, he was attentive, he was something like what he had been to hercousins: he wanted, she supposed, to cheat her of her tranquillity ashe had cheated them; and whether he might not have some concern in thisnecklace--she could not be convinced that he had not, for Miss Crawford,complaisant as a sister, was careless as a woman and a friend.Reflecting and doubting, and feeling that the possession of what she hadso much wished for did not bring much satisfaction, she now walkedhome again, with a change rather than a diminution of cares since hertreading that path before."
Mansfield Park,27,"CHAPTER XXVIIOn reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit thisunexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in somefavourite box in the East room, which held all her smaller treasures;but on opening the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmundthere writing at the table! Such a sight having never occurred before,was almost as wonderful as it was welcome.""Fanny,"" said he directly, leaving his seat and his pen, and meeting herwith something in his hand, ""I beg your pardon for being here. I cameto look for you, and after waiting a little while in hope of your comingin, was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You will findthe beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my business,which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle--a chainfor William's cross. You ought to have had it a week ago, but there hasbeen a delay from my brother's not being in town by several days so soonas I expected; and I have only just now received it at Northampton. Ihope you will like the chain itself, Fanny. I endeavoured to consult thesimplicity of your taste; but, at any rate, I know you will be kind tomy intentions, and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love ofone of your oldest friends.""And so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by athousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; butquickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out, ""Oh! cousin, stopa moment, pray stop!""He turned back.""I cannot attempt to thank you,"" she continued, in a very agitatedmanner; ""thanks are out of the question. I feel much more than I canpossibly express. Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way isbeyond--""""If that is all you have to say, Fanny"" smiling and turning away again.""No, no, it is not. I want to consult you.""Almost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he had just putinto her hand, and seeing before her, in all the niceness of jewellers'packing, a plain gold chain, perfectly simple and neat, she could nothelp bursting forth again, ""Oh, this is beautiful indeed! This is thevery thing, precisely what I wished for! This is the only ornament Ihave ever had a desire to possess. It will exactly suit my cross. Theymust and shall be worn together. It comes, too, in such an acceptablemoment. Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is.""""My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much. I am mosthappy that you like the chain, and that it should be here in time forto-morrow; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion. Believe me, Ihave no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours.No, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete, so unalloyed. Itis without a drawback.""Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hourwithout saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment, obligedher to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying, ""But whatis it that you want to consult me about?""It was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing toreturn, and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing. She gave thehistory of her recent visit, and now her raptures might well be over;for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with whatMiss Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conductbetween them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of onepleasure over his own mind, though it might have its drawback. It wassome time before she could get his attention to her plan, or any answerto her demand of his opinion: he was in a reverie of fond reflection,uttering only now and then a few half-sentences of praise; but whenhe did awake and understand, he was very decided in opposing what shewished.""Return the necklace! No, my dear Fanny, upon no account. It would bemortifying her severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensationthan the having anything returned on our hands which we have given witha reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend. Whyshould she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of?""""If it had been given to me in the first instance,"" said Fanny, ""Ishould not have thought of returning it; but being her brother'spresent, is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part withit, when it is not wanted?""""She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and itshaving been originally her brother's gift makes no difference; for asshe was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on thataccount, it ought not to prevent you from keeping it. No doubt it ishandsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom.""""No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, formy purpose, not half so fit. The chain will agree with William's crossbeyond all comparison better than the necklace.""""For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I amsure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than givepain to one who has been so studious of your comfort. Miss Crawford'sattentions to you have been--not more than you were justly entitledto--I am the last person to think that _could_ _be_, but they have beeninvariable; and to be returning them with what must have something the_air_ of ingratitude, though I know it could never have the _meaning_,is not in your nature, I am sure. Wear the necklace, as you are engagedto do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain, which was not ordered withany reference to the ball, be kept for commoner occasions. This is myadvice. I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whoseintimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure, and in whosecharacters there is so much general resemblance in true generosityand natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resultingprincipally from situation, no reasonable hindrance to a perfectfriendship. I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,"" herepeated, his voice sinking a little, ""between the two dearest objects Ihave on earth.""He was gone as he spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself asshe could. She was one of his two dearest--that must support her. Butthe other: the first! She had never heard him speak so openly before,and though it told her no more than what she had long perceived, it wasa stab, for it told of his own convictions and views. They weredecided. He would marry Miss Crawford. It was a stab, in spite of everylong-standing expectation; and she was obliged to repeat again andagain, that she was one of his two dearest, before the words gave herany sensation. Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him, it wouldbe--oh, how different would it be--how far more tolerable! But he wasdeceived in her: he gave her merits which she had not; her faults werewhat they had ever been, but he saw them no longer. Till she had shedmany tears over this deception, Fanny could not subdue her agitation;and the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the influenceof fervent prayers for his happiness.It was her intention, as she felt it to be her duty, to try to overcomeall that was excessive, all that bordered on selfishness, in heraffection for Edmund. To call or to fancy it a loss, a disappointment,would be a presumption for which she had not words strong enough tosatisfy her own humility. To think of him as Miss Crawford might bejustified in thinking, would in her be insanity. To her he could benothing under any circumstances; nothing dearer than a friend. Why didsuch an idea occur to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden? Itought not to have touched on the confines of her imagination. She wouldendeavour to be rational, and to deserve the right of judging of MissCrawford's character, and the privilege of true solicitude for him by asound intellect and an honest heart.She had all the heroism of principle, and was determined to do her duty;but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature, let her notbe much wondered at, if, after making all these good resolutions on theside of self-government, she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmundhad begun writing to her, as a treasure beyond all her hopes, andreading with the tenderest emotion these words, ""My very dear Fanny,you must do me the favour to accept"" locked it up with the chain, as thedearest part of the gift. It was the only thing approaching to a letterwhich she had ever received from him; she might never receive another;it was impossible that she ever should receive another so perfectlygratifying in the occasion and the style. Two lines more prized hadnever fallen from the pen of the most distinguished author--nevermore completely blessed the researches of the fondest biographer. Theenthusiasm of a woman's love is even beyond the biographer's. To her,the handwriting itself, independent of anything it may convey, is ablessedness. Never were such characters cut by any other human being asEdmund's commonest handwriting gave! This specimen, written in hasteas it was, had not a fault; and there was a felicity in the flow of thefirst four words, in the arrangement of ""My very dear Fanny,"" which shecould have looked at for ever.Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happymixture of reason and weakness, she was able in due time to go downand resume her usual employments near her aunt Bertram, and pay her theusual observances without any apparent want of spirits.Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened withmore kindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days oftenvolunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was broughtfrom Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he found himself obligedto go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could not help tryingto procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William couldmake up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had beenproposed, he would accept a place in his carriage. Mr. Crawford meant tobe in town by his uncle's accustomary late dinner-hour, and Williamwas invited to dine with him at the Admiral's. The proposal was a verypleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling postwith four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and, inlikening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once everythingin favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination couldsuggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly pleased;for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail fromNorthampton the following night, which would not have allowed him anhour's rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and thoughthis offer of Mr. Crawford's would rob her of many hours of his company,she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of sucha journey, to think of anything else. Sir Thomas approved of it foranother reason. His nephew's introduction to Admiral Crawford might beof service. The Admiral, he believed, had interest. Upon the whole, itwas a very joyous note. Fanny's spirits lived on it half the morning,deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to goaway.As for the ball, so near at hand, she had too many agitations and fearsto have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had,or must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies lookingforward to the same event in situations more at ease, but undercircumstances of less novelty, less interest, less peculiargratification, than would be attributed to her. Miss Price, knownonly by name to half the people invited, was now to make her firstappearance, and must be regarded as the queen of the evening. Who couldbe happier than Miss Price? But Miss Price had not been brought up tothe trade of _coming_ _out_; and had she known in what light this ballwas, in general, considered respecting her, it would very much havelessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doingwrong and being looked at. To dance without much observation or anyextraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half theevening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.Crawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep awayfrom her aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed tocomprehend her greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the bestof her hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of a longmorning, spent principally with her two aunts, she was often under theinfluence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to make thislast day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting; Edmund,she had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and leftalone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because thehousekeeper would have her own way with the supper, and whom _she_ couldnot avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at last tothink everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent off witha parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her own room, andfelt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share init.As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday; it had beenabout the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage, andfound Edmund in the East room. ""Suppose I were to find him there againto-day!"" said she to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.""Fanny,"" said a voice at that moment near her. Starting and looking up,she saw, across the lobby she had just reached, Edmund himself, standingat the head of a different staircase. He came towards her. ""You looktired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far.""""No, I have not been out at all.""""Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You hadbetter have gone out.""Fanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; andthough he looked at her with his usual kindness, she believed he hadsoon ceased to think of her countenance. He did not appear in spirits:something unconnected with her was probably amiss. They proceededupstairs together, their rooms being on the same floor above.""I come from Dr. Grant's,"" said Edmund presently. ""You may guess myerrand there, Fanny."" And he looked so conscious, that Fanny could thinkbut of one errand, which turned her too sick for speech. ""I wished toengage Miss Crawford for the two first dances,"" was the explanation thatfollowed, and brought Fanny to life again, enabling her, as she foundshe was expected to speak, to utter something like an inquiry as to theresult.""Yes,"" he answered, ""she is engaged to me; but"" (with a smile that didnot sit easy) ""she says it is to be the last time that she ever willdance with me. She is not serious. I think, I hope, I am sure she isnot serious; but I would rather not hear it. She never has danced with aclergyman, she says, and she never _will_. For my own sake, I could wishthere had been no ball just at--I mean not this very week, this veryday; to-morrow I leave home.""Fanny struggled for speech, and said, ""I am very sorry that anything hasoccurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My unclemeant it so.""""Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure. It will all end right. Iam only vexed for a moment. In fact, it is not that I consider the ballas ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny,"" stopping her, by takingher hand, and speaking low and seriously, ""you know what all this means.You see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tellyou, how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little. You are akind, kind listener. I have been pained by her manner this morning, andcannot get the better of it. I know her disposition to be as sweet andfaultless as your own, but the influence of her former companionsmakes her seem--gives to her conversation, to her professed opinions,sometimes a tinge of wrong. She does not _think_ evil, but she speaksit, speaks it in playfulness; and though I know it to be playfulness, itgrieves me to the soul.""""The effect of education,"" said Fanny gently.Edmund could not but agree to it. ""Yes, that uncle and aunt! They haveinjured the finest mind; for sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it doesappear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted.""Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment, and therefore,after a moment's consideration, said, ""If you only want me as alistener, cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualifiedfor an adviser. Do not ask advice of _me_. I am not competent.""""You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you neednot be afraid. It is a subject on which I should never ask advice; itis the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked; and few,I imagine, do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against theirconscience. I only want to talk to you.""""One thing more. Excuse the liberty; but take care _how_ you talk to me.Do not tell me anything now, which hereafter you may be sorry for. Thetime may come--""The colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke.""Dearest Fanny!"" cried Edmund, pressing her hand to his lips withalmost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford's, ""you are allconsiderate thought! But it is unnecessary here. The time will nevercome. No such time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to think itmost improbable: the chances grow less and less; and even if it should,there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we needbe afraid of, for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if theyare removed, it must be by changes that will only raise her characterthe more by the recollection of the faults she once had. You are theonly being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said; but youhave always known my opinion of her; you can bear me witness, Fanny,that I have never been blinded. How many a time have we talked overher little errors! You need not fear me; I have almost given up everyserious idea of her; but I must be a blockhead indeed, if, whateverbefell me, I could think of your kindness and sympathy without thesincerest gratitude.""He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen. He had saidenough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known,and with a brighter look, she answered, ""Yes, cousin, I am convincedthat _you_ would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps somemight not. I cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say. Donot check yourself. Tell me whatever you like.""They were now on the second floor, and the appearance of a housemaidprevented any farther conversation. For Fanny's present comfort it wasconcluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he been able to talkanother five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talkedaway all Miss Crawford's faults and his own despondence. But as it was,they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection, and withsome very precious sensations on hers. She had felt nothing like it forhours. Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford's note to William had wornaway, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had beenno comfort around, no hope within her. Now everything was smiling.William's good fortune returned again upon her mind, and seemed ofgreater value than at first. The ball, too--such an evening of pleasurebefore her! It was now a real animation; and she began to dress for itwith much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball. All went well:she did not dislike her own looks; and when she came to the necklacesagain, her good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one givenher by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross.She had, to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too large forthe purpose. His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with delightfulfeelings, joined the chain and the cross--those memorials of the twomost beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for each otherby everything real and imaginary--and put them round her neck, and seenand felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she was able, withoutan effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford's necklace too. Sheacknowledged it to be right. Miss Crawford had a claim; and when it wasno longer to encroach on, to interfere with the stronger claims, thetruer kindness of another, she could do her justice even with pleasureto herself. The necklace really looked very well; and Fanny left herroom at last, comfortably satisfied with herself and all about her.Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusualdegree of wakefulness. It had really occurred to her, unprompted, thatFanny, preparing for a ball, might be glad of better help than the upperhousemaid's, and when dressed herself, she actually sent her own maid toassist her; too late, of course, to be of any use. Mrs. Chapman had justreached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her room completelydressed, and only civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt her aunt'sattention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could dothemselves."
Mansfield Park,28,"CHAPTER XXVIIIHer uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing-room when Fanny wentdown. To the former she was an interesting object, and he saw withpleasure the general elegance of her appearance, and her being inremarkably good looks. The neatness and propriety of her dress was allthat he would allow himself to commend in her presence, but upon herleaving the room again soon afterwards, he spoke of her beauty with verydecided praise.""Yes,"" said Lady Bertram, ""she looks very well. I sent Chapman to her.""""Look well! Oh, yes!"" cried Mrs. Norris, ""she has good reason to lookwell with all her advantages: brought up in this family as she has been,with all the benefit of her cousins' manners before her. Only think, mydear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I have been themeans of giving her. The very gown you have been taking notice of isyour own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married. Whatwould she have been if we had not taken her by the hand?""Sir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table the eyes ofthe two young men assured him that the subject might be gently touchedagain, when the ladies withdrew, with more success. Fanny saw that shewas approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look stillbetter. From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon madestill happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, whowas holding open the door, said, as she passed him, ""You must dancewith me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,except the first."" She had nothing more to wish for. She had hardlyever been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life. Hercousins' former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising toher; she felt it to be indeed very charming, and was actually practisingher steps about the drawing-room as long as she could be safe from thenotice of her aunt Norris, who was entirely taken up at first in fresharranging and injuring the noble fire which the butler had prepared.Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid under anyother circumstances, but Fanny's happiness still prevailed. It was butto think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessnessof Mrs. Norris? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?The gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet expectation ofa carriage, when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused,and they all stood about and talked and laughed, and every moment hadits pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt that there must be a strugglein Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the effort sosuccessfully made.When the carriages were really heard, when the guests began really toassemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the sight of somany strangers threw her back into herself; and besides the gravity andformality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither SirThomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she found herselfoccasionally called on to endure something worse. She was introducedhere and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken to, and to curtsey,and speak again. This was a hard duty, and she was never summoned toit without looking at William, as he walked about at his ease in thebackground of the scene, and longing to be with him.The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch. Thestiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners andmore diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and everybody grewcomfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toilsof civility, would have been again most happy, could she have kept hereyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford. _She_ looked allloveliness--and what might not be the end of it? Her own musingswere brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, andher thoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almostinstantly for the first two dances. Her happiness on this occasion wasvery much _a_ _la_ _mortal_, finely chequered. To be secure of a partnerat first was a most essential good--for the moment of beginning was nowgrowing seriously near; and she so little understood her own claims asto think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been thelast to be sought after, and should have received a partner only througha series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would have beenterrible; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his manner ofasking her which she did not like, and she saw his eye glancing fora moment at her necklace, with a smile--she thought there was asmile--which made her blush and feel wretched. And though there was nosecond glance to disturb her, though his object seemed then to be onlyquietly agreeable, she could not get the better of her embarrassment,heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it, and had nocomposure till he turned away to some one else. Then she could graduallyrise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a partner, a voluntarypartner, secured against the dancing began.When the company were moving into the ballroom, she found herselffor the first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles wereimmediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother's had been,and who was beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxiousto get the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the secondnecklace: the real chain. Miss Crawford listened; and all her intendedcompliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only onething; and her eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they couldyet be brighter, she exclaimed with eager pleasure, ""Did he? Did Edmund?That was like himself. No other man would have thought of it. I honourhim beyond expression."" And she looked around as if longing to tell himso. He was not near, he was attending a party of ladies out of the room;and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm of each,they followed with the rest.Fanny's heart sunk, but there was no leisure for thinking long even ofMiss Crawford's feelings. They were in the ballroom, the violins wereplaying, and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing onanything serious. She must watch the general arrangements, and see howeverything was done.In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if she were engaged;and the ""Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,"" was exactly what he had intendedto hear. Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her,saying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she_ was to lead theway and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her before.Whenever she had thought of the minutiae of the evening, it had been asa matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford; and theimpression was so strong, that though _her_ _uncle_ spoke the contrary,she could not help an exclamation of surprise, a hint of her unfitness,an entreaty even to be excused. To be urging her opinion against SirThomas's was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was herhorror at the first suggestion, that she could actually look him inthe face and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise; in vain,however: Sir Thomas smiled, tried to encourage her, and then looked tooserious, and said too decidedly, ""It must be so, my dear,"" for her tohazard another word; and she found herself the next moment conducted byMr. Crawford to the top of the room, and standing there to be joined bythe rest of the dancers, couple after couple, as they were formed.She could hardly believe it. To be placed above so many elegant youngwomen! The distinction was too great. It was treating her like hercousins! And her thoughts flew to those absent cousins with mostunfeigned and truly tender regret, that they were not at home to taketheir own place in the room, and have their share of a pleasure whichwould have been so very delightful to them. So often as she had heardthem wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all felicities! Andto have them away when it was given--and for _her_ to be opening theball--and with Mr. Crawford too! She hoped they would not envy her thatdistinction _now_; but when she looked back to the state of things inthe autumn, to what they had all been to each other when once dancingin that house before, the present arrangement was almost more than shecould understand herself.The ball began. It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny, for thefirst dance at least: her partner was in excellent spirits, and tried toimpart them to her; but she was a great deal too much frightened to haveany enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at. Young,pretty, and gentle, however, she had no awkwardnesses that were notas good as graces, and there were few persons present that were notdisposed to praise her. She was attractive, she was modest, she was SirThomas's niece, and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford. Itwas enough to give her general favour. Sir Thomas himself was watchingher progress down the dance with much complacency; he was proud of hisniece; and without attributing all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norrisseemed to do, to her transplantation to Mansfield, he was pleased withhimself for having supplied everything else: education and manners sheowed to him.Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas's thoughts as he stood, and having,in spite of all his wrongs towards her, a general prevailing desire ofrecommending herself to him, took an opportunity of stepping aside tosay something agreeable of Fanny. Her praise was warm, and hereceived it as she could wish, joining in it as far as discretion, andpoliteness, and slowness of speech would allow, and certainly appearingto greater advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards,when Mary, perceiving her on a sofa very near, turned round before shebegan to dance, to compliment her on Miss Price's looks.""Yes, she does look very well,"" was Lady Bertram's placid reply.""Chapman helped her to dress. I sent Chapman to her."" Not but thatshe was really pleased to have Fanny admired; but she was so much morestruck with her own kindness in sending Chapman to her, that she couldnot get it out of her head.Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _her_by commendation of Fanny; to her, it was as the occasion offered--""Ah!ma'am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!"" andMrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she hadtime for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself in makingup card-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all thechaperons to a better part of the room.Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her intentionsto please. She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter,and filling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,misinterpreting Fanny's blushes, still thought she must be doing so whenshe went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a significantlook, ""Perhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother goes to town to-morrow?He says he has business there, but will not tell me what. The first timehe ever denied me his confidence! But this is what we all come to.All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply to you forinformation. Pray, what is Henry going for?""Fanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her embarrassment allowed.""Well, then,"" replied Miss Crawford, laughing, ""I must suppose it to bepurely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of youby the way.""Fanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while MissCrawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her over-anxious,or thought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible ofpleasure in Henry's attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment inthe course of the evening; but Henry's attentions had very little todo with it. She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again sovery soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that hisprevious inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all forthe sake of securing her at that part of the evening. But it was not tobe avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though shecould not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacyor ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William,he was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heartwhich did him credit. But still his attentions made no part of hersatisfaction. She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw howperfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she couldwalk about with him and hear his account of his partners; she was happyin knowing herself admired; and she was happy in having the two danceswith Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of theevening, her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefiniteengagement with _him_ was in continual perspective. She was happy evenwhen they did take place; but not from any flow of spirits on his side,or any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning.His mind was fagged, and her happiness sprung from being the friend withwhom it could find repose. ""I am worn out with civility,"" said he. ""Ihave been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say. Butwith _you_, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want to be talkedto. Let us have the luxury of silence."" Fanny would hardly even speakher agreement. A weariness, arising probably, in great measure, from thesame feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarlyto be respected, and they went down their two dances together with suchsober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on that Sir Thomas hadbeen bringing up no wife for his younger son.The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure. Miss Crawford hadbeen in gay spirits when they first danced together, but it was not hergaiety that could do him good: it rather sank than raised his comfort;and afterwards, for he found himself still impelled to seek heragain, she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of theprofession to which he was now on the point of belonging. They hadtalked, and they had been silent; he had reasoned, she had ridiculed;and they had parted at last with mutual vexation. Fanny, not able torefrain entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerablysatisfied. It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering. Yetsome happiness must and would arise from the very conviction that he didsuffer.When her two dances with him were over, her inclination and strength formore were pretty well at an end; and Sir Thomas, having seen her walkrather than dance down the shortening set, breathless, and with her handat her side, gave his orders for her sitting down entirely. From thattime Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.""Poor Fanny!"" cried William, coming for a moment to visit her, andworking away his partner's fan as if for life, ""how soon she is knockedup! Why, the sport is but just begun. I hope we shall keep it up thesetwo hours. How can you be tired so soon?""""So soon! my good friend,"" said Sir Thomas, producing his watch with allnecessary caution; ""it is three o'clock, and your sister is not used tothese sort of hours.""""Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go. Sleep aslong as you can, and never mind me.""""Oh! William.""""What! Did she think of being up before you set off?""""Oh! yes, sir,"" cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her seat to be nearerher uncle; ""I must get up and breakfast with him. It will be the lasttime, you know; the last morning.""""You had better not. He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half-pastnine. Mr. Crawford, I think you call for him at half-past nine?""Fanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her eyes fordenial; and it ended in a gracious ""Well, well!"" which was permission.""Yes, half-past nine,"" said Crawford to William as the latter wasleaving them, ""and I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind sisterto get up for _me_."" And in a lower tone to Fanny, ""I shall have onlya desolate house to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of timeand his own very different to-morrow.""After a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the earlybreakfast party in that house instead of eating alone: he should himselfbe of it; and the readiness with which his invitation was acceptedconvinced him that the suspicions whence, he must confess to himself,this very ball had in great measure sprung, were well founded. Mr.Crawford was in love with Fanny. He had a pleasing anticipation of whatwould be. His niece, meanwhile, did not thank him for what he had justdone. She had hoped to have William all to herself the last morning. Itwould have been an unspeakable indulgence. But though her wisheswere overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring within her. On thecontrary, she was so totally unused to have her pleasure consulted, orto have anything take place at all in the way she could desire, that shewas more disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her point sofar, than to repine at the counteraction which followed.Shortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with herinclination, by advising her to go immediately to bed. ""Advise"" was hisword, but it was the advice of absolute power, and she had only torise, and, with Mr. Crawford's very cordial adieus, pass quietly away;stopping at the entrance-door, like the Lady of Branxholm Hall, ""onemoment and no more,"" to view the happy scene, and take a last look atthe five or six determined couple who were still hard at work; and then,creeping slowly up the principal staircase, pursued by the ceaselesscountry-dance, feverish with hopes and fears, soup and negus,sore-footed and fatigued, restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spiteof everything, that a ball was indeed delightful.In thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinkingmerely of her health. It might occur to him that Mr. Crawford had beensitting by her long enough, or he might mean to recommend her as a wifeby shewing her persuadableness."
Mansfield Park,29,"CHAPTER XXIXThe ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kisswas given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as he foretold, beenvery punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to thebreakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholychange; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving,perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise hertender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard inWilliam's plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg-shellsin Mr. Crawford's. She sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as her uncleintended, but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other. William wasgone, and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle caresand selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.Fanny's disposition was such that she could never even think of heraunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house,without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to herwhen they had been last together; much less could her feelings acquither of having done and said and thought everything by William that wasdue to him for a whole fortnight.It was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon after the second breakfast, Edmundbade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his horse for Peterborough,and then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but remembrances,which she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt Bertram--shemust talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so little ofwhat had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was heavy work.Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody's dress or anybody's place atsupper but her own. ""She could not recollect what it was that she hadheard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was that Lady Prescotthad noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had beentalking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finestyoung man in the room--somebody had whispered something to her; she hadforgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be."" And these were her longestspeeches and clearest communications: the rest was only a languid ""Yes,yes; very well; did you? did he? I did not see _that_; I should not knowone from the other."" This was very bad. It was only better than Mrs.Norris's sharp answers would have been; but she being gone home withall the supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid, there was peaceand good-humour in their little party, though it could not boast muchbeside.The evening was heavy like the day. ""I cannot think what is the matterwith me,"" said Lady Bertram, when the tea-things were removed. ""I feelquite stupid. It must be sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you mustdo something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch the cards; I feel sovery stupid.""The cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt tillbedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds wereheard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of thegame--""And _that_ makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib. Youare to deal, ma'am; shall I deal for you?"" Fanny thought and thoughtagain of the difference which twenty-four hours had made in that room,and all that part of the house. Last night it had been hope and smiles,bustle and motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and outof the drawing-room, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all butsolitude.A good night's rest improved her spirits. She could think of William thenext day more cheerfully; and as the morning afforded her an opportunityof talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford, in avery handsome style, with all the heightenings of imagination, andall the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of adeparted ball, she could afterwards bring her mind without much effortinto its everyday state, and easily conform to the tranquillity of thepresent quiet week.They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there fora whole day together, and _he_ was gone on whom the comfort andcheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended.But this must be learned to be endured. He would soon be always gone;and she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room with heruncle, hear his voice, receive his questions, and even answer them,without such wretched feelings as she had formerly known.""We miss our two young men,"" was Sir Thomas's observation on both thefirst and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle afterdinner; and in consideration of Fanny's swimming eyes, nothing more wassaid on the first day than to drink their good health; but on thesecond it led to something farther. William was kindly commended andhis promotion hoped for. ""And there is no reason to suppose,"" added SirThomas, ""but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent. As toEdmund, we must learn to do without him. This will be the last winter ofhis belonging to us, as he has done.""""Yes,"" said Lady Bertram, ""but I wish he was not going away. They areall going away, I think. I wish they would stay at home.""This wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied forpermission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it bestfor each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram,though in her own good-nature she would not have prevented it, waslamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia's return, whichwould otherwise have taken place about this time. A great deal of goodsense followed on Sir Thomas's side, tending to reconcile his wife tothe arrangement. Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feelwas advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate mother_must_ feel in promoting her children's enjoyment was attributed to hernature. Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm ""Yes""; and at the endof a quarter of an hour's silent consideration spontaneously observed,""Sir Thomas, I have been thinking--and I am very glad we took Fanny aswe did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.""Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, ""Very true.We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face,she is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to _her_, sheis now quite as necessary to _us_.""""Yes,"" said Lady Bertram presently; ""and it is a comfort to think thatwe shall always have _her_.""Sir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece, and then gravelyreplied, ""She will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some otherhome that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knowshere.""""And _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite her?Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then, but shewould not think of asking her to live there; and I am sure she is betteroff here; and besides, I cannot do without her.""The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house inMansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage. To the younglady, at least, in each family, it brought very different feelings. Whatwas tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation toMary. Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one soeasily satisfied, the other so unused to endure; but still more might beimputed to difference of circumstances. In some points of interest theywere exactly opposed to each other. To Fanny's mind, Edmund's absencewas really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief. To Mary it wasevery way painful. She felt the want of his society every day, almostevery hour, and was too much in want of it to derive anything butirritation from considering the object for which he went. He could nothave devised anything more likely to raise his consequence than thisweek's absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her brother'sgoing away, of William Price's going too, and completing the sort ofgeneral break-up of a party which had been so animated. She felt itkeenly. They were now a miserable trio, confined within doors by aseries of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no variety to hope for.Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions, and actingon them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they hadhardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking ofhim continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, andlonging again for the almost daily meetings they lately had. His absencewas unnecessarily long. He should not have planned such an absence--heshould not have left home for a week, when her own departure fromMansfield was so near. Then she began to blame herself. She wished shehad not spoken so warmly in their last conversation. She was afraid shehad used some strong, some contemptuous expressions in speaking of theclergy, and that should not have been. It was ill-bred; it was wrong.She wished such words unsaid with all her heart.Her vexation did not end with the week. All this was bad, but she hadstill more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund;when Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slightcommunication with the other family which Sunday produced, she learnedthat he had actually written home to defer his return, having promisedto remain some days longer with his friend.If she had felt impatience and regret before--if she had been sorry forwhat she said, and feared its too strong effect on him--she now feltand feared it all tenfold more. She had, moreover, to contend with onedisagreeable emotion entirely new to her--jealousy. His friend Mr.Owen had sisters; he might find them attractive. But, at any rate, hisstaying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she wasto remove to London, meant something that she could not bear. Had Henryreturned, as he talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, sheshould now have been leaving Mansfield. It became absolutely necessaryfor her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more. She could notlive any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she made her wayto the Park, through difficulties of walking which she had deemedunconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little inaddition, for the sake of at least hearing his name.The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing. Butat last Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately MissCrawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she could--""Andhow do _you_ like your cousin Edmund's staying away so long? Being theonly young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer.You must miss him. Does his staying longer surprise you?""""I do not know,"" said Fanny hesitatingly. ""Yes; I had not particularlyexpected it.""""Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of. It is the generalway all young men do.""""He did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before.""""He finds the house more agreeable _now_. He is a very--a very pleasingyoung man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at notseeing him again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be thecase. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes therewill be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seenhim once more, I confess. But you must give my compliments to him. Yes;I think it must be compliments. Is not there a something wanted,Miss Price, in our language--a something between compliments and--andlove--to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together? Somany months' acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here.Was his letter a long one? Does he give you much account of what he isdoing? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?""""I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believeit was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines. All that Iheard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer, and that hehad agreed to do so. A _few_ days longer, or _some_ days longer; I amnot quite sure which.""""Oh! if he wrote to his father; but I thought it might have been to LadyBertram or you. But if he wrote to his father, no wonder he was concise.Who could write chat to Sir Thomas? If he had written to you, therewould have been more particulars. You would have heard of ballsand parties. He would have sent you a description of everything andeverybody. How many Miss Owens are there?""""Three grown up.""""Are they musical?""""I do not at all know. I never heard.""""That is the first question, you know,"" said Miss Crawford, trying toappear gay and unconcerned, ""which every woman who plays herself is sureto ask about another. But it is very foolish to ask questions aboutany young ladies--about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows,without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished andpleasing, and one very pretty. There is a beauty in every family; it isa regular thing. Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp; andall sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better fornot being taught; or something like it.""""I know nothing of the Miss Owens,"" said Fanny calmly.""You know nothing and you care less, as people say. Never did toneexpress indifference plainer. Indeed, how can one care for those one hasnever seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he will find Mansfieldvery quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself. Ido not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near. Shedoes not like my going.""Fanny felt obliged to speak. ""You cannot doubt your being missed bymany,"" said she. ""You will be very much missed.""Miss Crawford turned her eye on her, as if wanting to hear or see more,and then laughingly said, ""Oh yes! missed as every noisy evil is missedwhen it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt. But Iam not fishing; don't compliment me. If I _am_ missed, it will appear.I may be discovered by those who want to see me. I shall not be in anydoubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.""Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford wasdisappointed; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of herpower from one who she thought must know, and her spirits were cloudedagain.""The Miss Owens,"" said she, soon afterwards; ""suppose you were to haveone of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like it?Stranger things have happened. I dare say they are trying for it. Andthey are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty establishmentfor them. I do not at all wonder or blame them. It is everybody's dutyto do as well for themselves as they can. Sir Thomas Bertram's son issomebody; and now he is in their own line. Their father is a clergyman,and their brother is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together.He is their lawful property; he fairly belongs to them. You don't speak,Fanny; Miss Price, you don't speak. But honestly now, do not you ratherexpect it than otherwise?""""No,"" said Fanny stoutly, ""I do not expect it at all.""""Not at all!"" cried Miss Crawford with alacrity. ""I wonder at that. ButI dare say you know exactly--I always imagine you are--perhaps you donot think him likely to marry at all--or not at present.""""No, I do not,"" said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err either in thebelief or the acknowledgment of it.Her companion looked at her keenly; and gathering greater spirit fromthe blush soon produced from such a look, only said, ""He is best off ashe is,"" and turned the subject."
Mansfield Park,30,"CHAPTER XXXMiss Crawford's uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, andshe walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost anotherweek of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been putto the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down fromLondon again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, shehad nothing farther to try her own. His still refusing to tell her whathe had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it mighthave irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke--suspected only ofconcealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And thenext day _did_ bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he should justgo and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, buthe was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting forhim to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most impatiently inthe sweep, and cried out, ""My dear Henry, where can you have beenall this time?"" he had only to say that he had been sitting with LadyBertram and Fanny.""Sitting with them an hour and a half!"" exclaimed Mary.But this was only the beginning of her surprise.""Yes, Mary,"" said he, drawing her arm within his, and walking alongthe sweep as if not knowing where he was: ""I could not get away sooner;Fanny looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is entirelymade up. Will it astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am quitedetermined to marry Fanny Price.""The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever hisconsciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such viewshad never entered his sister's imagination; and she looked so truly theastonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said,and more fully and more solemnly. The conviction of his determinationonce admitted, it was not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with thesurprise. Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with theBertram family, and to be not displeased with her brother's marrying alittle beneath him.""Yes, Mary,"" was Henry's concluding assurance. ""I am fairly caught.You know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them.I have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in heraffections; but my own are entirely fixed.""""Lucky, lucky girl!"" cried Mary, as soon as she could speak; ""what amatch for her! My dearest Henry, this must be my _first_ feeling; butmy _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve yourchoice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wishand desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude anddevotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her! Mrs.Norris often talks of her luck; what will she say now? The delightof all the family, indeed! And she has some _true_ friends in it! How_they_ will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever. Whendid you begin to think seriously about her?""Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, thoughnothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. ""How the pleasingplague had stolen on him"" he could not say; and before he had expressedthe same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over,his sister eagerly interrupted him with, ""Ah, my dear Henry, and thisis what took you to London! This was your business! You chose to consultthe Admiral before you made up your mind.""But this he stoutly denied. He knew his uncle too well to consult him onany matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it neverpardonable in a young man of independent fortune.""When Fanny is known to him,"" continued Henry, ""he will doat on her.She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man asthe Admiral, for she he would describe, if indeed he has now delicacyof language enough to embody his own ideas. But till it is absolutelysettled--settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of thematter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You have not discovered mybusiness yet.""""Well, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and amin no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! ThatMansfield should have done so much for--that _you_ should have foundyour fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not havechosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do notwant for fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good. TheBertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country. Sheis niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world. Butgo on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she know her ownhappiness?""""No.""""What are you waiting for?""""For--for very little more than opportunity. Mary, she is not like hercousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.""""Oh no! you cannot. Were you even less pleasing--supposing her not tolove you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)--you wouldbe safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secureher all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she wouldmarry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the worldcapable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but askher to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.""As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tellas she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeplyinteresting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing torelate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny's charms.Fanny's beauty of face and figure, Fanny's graces of manner and goodnessof heart, were the exhaustless theme. The gentleness, modesty, andsweetness of her character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetnesswhich makes so essential a part of every woman's worth in the judgmentof man, that though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can neverbelieve it absent. Her temper he had good reason to depend on andto praise. He had often seen it tried. Was there one of the family,excepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually exercisedher patience and forbearance? Her affections were evidently strong. Tosee her with her brother! What could more delightfully prove that thewarmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness? What could be moreencouraging to a man who had her love in view? Then, her understandingwas beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her manners were themirror of her own modest and elegant mind. Nor was this all. HenryCrawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principlesin a wife, though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection toknow them by their proper name; but when he talked of her having such asteadiness and regularity of conduct, such a high notion of honour, andsuch an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullestdependence on her faith and integrity, he expressed what was inspired bythe knowledge of her being well principled and religious.""I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her,"" said he; ""and _that_is what I want.""Well might his sister, believing as she really did that his opinion ofFanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits, rejoice in her prospects.""The more I think of it,"" she cried, ""the more am I convinced that youare doing quite right; and though I should never have selected FannyPrice as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she isthe very one to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her peace turnsout a clever thought indeed. You will both find your good in it.""""It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not knowher then; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first putit into my head. I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she hasever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take herfrom Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in thisneighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years' leaseof Everingham. I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word. I couldname three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank me.""""Ha!"" cried Mary; ""settle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then weshall be all together.""When she had spoken it, she recollected herself, and wished it unsaid;but there was no need of confusion; for her brother saw her only as thesupposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her inthe kindest manner to his own house, and to claim the best right in her.""You must give us more than half your time,"" said he. ""I cannot admitMrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shallboth have a right in you. Fanny will be so truly your sister!""Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances; but she wasnow very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sistermany months longer.""You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?""""Yes.""""That's right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longerwith the Admiral. My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting awayfrom the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his,before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned tosit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! _You_ arenot sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but,in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To haveseen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture, wouldhave broken my heart.""""Well, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has hisfaults, but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father tome. Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You mustnot prejudice Fanny against him. I must have them love one another.""Mary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could not be twopersons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant:time would discover it to him; but she could not help _this_ reflectionon the Admiral. ""Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if Icould suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason whichmy poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent themarriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_would be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased tolove, she would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of agentleman.""The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make FannyPrice happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course thegroundwork of his eloquent answer.""Had you seen her this morning, Mary,"" he continued, ""attending withsuch ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt'sstupidity, working with her, and for her, her colour beautifullyheightened as she leant over the work, then returning to her seat tofinish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for thatstupid woman's service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness,so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have amoment at her own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is,and one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she now and thenshook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to_me_, or listening, and as if she liked to listen, to what I said. Hadyou seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of herpower over my heart ever ceasing.""""My dearest Henry,"" cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his face,""how glad I am to see you so much in love! It quite delights me. Butwhat will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?""""I care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see whatsort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense.I wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see theircousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartilyashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They will beangry,"" he added, after a moment's silence, and in a cooler tone; ""Mrs.Rushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to her; that is,like other bitter pills, it will have two moments' ill flavour, and thenbe swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb as to supposeher feelings more lasting than other women's, though _I_ was the objectof them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a daily,hourly difference, in the behaviour of every being who approaches her;and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doerof it, that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due.Now she is dependent, helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten.""""Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless orforgotten. Her cousin Edmund never forgets her.""""Edmund! True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, andso is Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior,long-worded, arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund togetherdo, what do they _do_ for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity inthe world, to what I _shall_ do?"""
Mansfield Park,31,"CHAPTER XXXIHenry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at anearlier hour than common visiting warrants. The two ladies were togetherin the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him, Lady Bertram was on thevery point of quitting it as he entered. She was almost at the door, andnot chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain, she still wenton, after a civil reception, a short sentence about being waited for,and a ""Let Sir Thomas know"" to the servant.Henry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off, and withoutlosing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out someletters, said, with a most animated look, ""I must acknowledge myselfinfinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunityof seeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have anyidea. Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could hardlyhave borne that any one in the house should share with you in thefirst knowledge of the news I now bring. He is made. Your brother is alieutenant. I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you onyour brother's promotion. Here are the letters which announce it, thismoment come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them.""Fanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak. To see theexpression of her eyes, the change of her complexion, the progress ofher feelings, their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough. She tookthe letters as he gave them. The first was from the Admiral to informhis nephew, in a few words, of his having succeeded in the object he hadundertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing two more, onefrom the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom the Admiral hadset to work in the business, the other from that friend to himself,by which it appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness ofattending to the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir Charles wasmuch delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his regardfor Admiral Crawford, and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price'scommission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out wasspreading general joy through a wide circle of great people.While her hand was trembling under these letters, her eye running fromone to the other, and her heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thuscontinued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in theevent--""I will not talk of my own happiness,"" said he, ""great as it is, for Ithink only of yours. Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? Ihave almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought tohave known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however.The post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment'sdelay. How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject,I will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruellydisappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I waskept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dearto me than such an object would have detained me half the time fromMansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all thewarmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there weredifficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements ofanother, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, andknowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday,trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed bysuch very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man inthe world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after seeing yourbrother. He was delighted with him. I would not allow myself yesterdayto say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in hispraise. I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise ofa friend, as this day _does_ prove it. _Now_ I may say that even I couldnot require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be followedby warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most voluntarilybestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together.""""Has this been all _your_ doing, then?"" cried Fanny. ""Good heaven! howvery, very kind! Have you really--was it by _your_ desire? I beg yourpardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? Iam stupefied.""Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at anearlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he had done. Hislast journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than thatof introducing her brother in Hill Street, and prevailing on the Admiralto exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on. This hadbeen his business. He had communicated it to no creature: he had notbreathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the issue,he could not have borne any participation of his feelings, but this hadbeen his business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitudehad been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding in the_deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_ _wishes__more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have remainedinsensible of his drift, had she been able to attend; but her heart wasso full and her senses still so astonished, that she could listen butimperfectly even to what he told her of William, and saying only whenhe paused, ""How kind! how very kind! Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are infinitelyobliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!"" She jumped up and moved inhaste towards the door, crying out, ""I will go to my uncle. My uncleought to know it as soon as possible."" But this could not be suffered.The opportunity was too fair, and his feelings too impatient. He wasafter her immediately. ""She must not go, she must allow him five minuteslonger,"" and he took her hand and led her back to her seat, and was inthe middle of his farther explanation, before she had suspected for whatshe was detained. When she did understand it, however, and found herselfexpected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart hadnever known before, and that everything he had done for William was tobe placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachmentto her, she was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments unableto speak. She considered it all as nonsense, as mere trifling andgallantry, which meant only to deceive for the hour; she could not butfeel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily, and in such away as she had not deserved; but it was like himself, and entirely of apiece with what she had seen before; and she would not allow herself toshew half the displeasure she felt, because he had been conferring anobligation, which no want of delicacy on his part could make a trifleto her. While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude onWilliam's behalf, she could not be severely resentful of anything thatinjured only herself; and after having twice drawn back her hand, andtwice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she got up, and saidonly, with much agitation, ""Don't, Mr. Crawford, pray don't! I beg youwould not. This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me. Imust go away. I cannot bear it."" But he was still talking on, describinghis affection, soliciting a return, and, finally, in words so plain asto bear but one meaning even to her, offering himself, hand, fortune,everything, to her acceptance. It was so; he had said it. Herastonishment and confusion increased; and though still not knowinghow to suppose him serious, she could hardly stand. He pressed for ananswer.""No, no, no!"" she cried, hiding her face. ""This is all nonsense. Do notdistress me. I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to William makesme more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, Icannot bear, I must not listen to such--No, no, don't think of me. Butyou are _not_ thinking of me. I know it is all nothing.""She had burst away from him, and at that moment Sir Thomas was heardspeaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in. It wasno time for farther assurances or entreaty, though to part with her ata moment when her modesty alone seemed, to his sanguine and preassuredmind, to stand in the way of the happiness he sought, was a cruelnecessity. She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her unclewas approaching, and was walking up and down the East room in theutmost confusion of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas's politenessor apologies were over, or he had reached the beginning of the joyfulintelligence which his visitor came to communicate.She was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything; agitated, happy,miserable, infinitely obliged, absolutely angry. It was all beyondbelief! He was inexcusable, incomprehensible! But such were his habitsthat he could do nothing without a mixture of evil. He had previouslymade her the happiest of human beings, and now he had insulted--she knewnot what to say, how to class, or how to regard it. She would not havehim be serious, and yet what could excuse the use of such words andoffers, if they meant but to trifle?But William was a lieutenant. _That_ was a fact beyond a doubt, andwithout an alloy. She would think of it for ever and forget all therest. Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again: he musthave seen how unwelcome it was to her; and in that case, how gratefullyshe could esteem him for his friendship to William!She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the greatstaircase, till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford's having leftthe house; but when convinced of his being gone, she was eager to godown and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness of his joyas well as her own, and all the benefit of his information or hisconjectures as to what would now be William's destination. Sir Thomaswas as joyful as she could desire, and very kind and communicative; andshe had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make herfeel as if nothing had occurred to vex her, till she found, towards theclose, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there thatvery day. This was a most unwelcome hearing, for though he might thinknothing of what had passed, it would be quite distressing to her to seehim again so soon.She tried to get the better of it; tried very hard, as the dinner hourapproached, to feel and appear as usual; but it was quite impossible forher not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor enteredthe room. She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrenceof circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on the first dayof hearing of William's promotion.Mr. Crawford was not only in the room--he was soon close to her. Hehad a note to deliver from his sister. Fanny could not look at him, butthere was no consciousness of past folly in his voice. She opened hernote immediately, glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she readit, to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris, who was also to dinethere, screened her a little from view.""My dear Fanny,--for so I may now always call you, to the infiniterelief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _Miss_ _Price_ for atleast the last six weeks--I cannot let my brother go without sending youa few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful consentand approval. Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there can be nodifficulties worth naming. I chuse to suppose that the assurance of myconsent will be something; so you may smile upon him with your sweetestsmiles this afternoon, and send him back to me even happier than hegoes.--Yours affectionately, M. C.""These were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she readin too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of MissCrawford's meaning, it was evident that she meant to compliment her onher brother's attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe it serious.She did not know what to do, or what to think. There was wretchedness inthe idea of its being serious; there was perplexity and agitation everyway. She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her, and he spoketo her much too often; and she was afraid there was a something in hisvoice and manner in addressing her very different from what they werewhen he talked to the others. Her comfort in that day's dinner wasquite destroyed: she could hardly eat anything; and when Sir Thomasgood-humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite, shewas ready to sink with shame, from the dread of Mr. Crawford'sinterpretation; for though nothing could have tempted her to turnher eyes to the right hand, where he sat, she felt that _his_ wereimmediately directed towards her.She was more silent than ever. She would hardly join even when Williamwas the subject, for his commission came all from the right hand too,and there was pain in the connexion.She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be indespair of ever getting away; but at last they were in the drawing-room,and she was able to think as she would, while her aunts finished thesubject of William's appointment in their own style.Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be toSir Thomas as with any part of it. ""_Now_ William would be able to keephimself, which would make a vast difference to his uncle, for it wasunknown how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make somedifference in _her_ presents too. She was very glad that she had givenWilliam what she did at parting, very glad, indeed, that it had been inher power, without material inconvenience, just at that time to give himsomething rather considerable; that is, for _her_, with _her_ limitedmeans, for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin.She knew he must be at some expense, that he would have many things tobuy, though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him inthe way of getting everything very cheap; but she was very glad she hadcontributed her mite towards it.""""I am glad you gave him something considerable,"" said Lady Bertram, withmost unsuspicious calmness, ""for _I_ gave him only 10 pounds.""""Indeed!"" cried Mrs. Norris, reddening. ""Upon my word, he must have goneoff with his pockets well lined, and at no expense for his journey toLondon either!""""Sir Thomas told me 10 pounds would be enough.""Mrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency,began to take the matter in another point.""It is amazing,"" said she, ""how much young people cost their friends,what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! Theylittle think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or theiruncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here aremy sister Price's children; take them all together, I dare say nobodywould believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say nothingof what _I_ do for them.""""Very true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot helpit; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny,William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and Ishall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having. Iwish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think Iwill have two shawls, Fanny.""Fanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it, was veryearnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at. Therewas everything in the world _against_ their being serious but his wordsand manner. Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against it;all their habits and ways of thinking, and all her own demerits. Howcould _she_ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen somany, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many, infinitelyher superiors; who seemed so little open to serious impressions, evenwhere pains had been taken to please him; who thought so slightly, socarelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything toeverybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him? And farther,how could it be supposed that his sister, with all her high and worldlynotions of matrimony, would be forwarding anything of a serious naturein such a quarter? Nothing could be more unnatural in either. Fannywas ashamed of her own doubts. Everything might be possible rather thanserious attachment, or serious approbation of it toward her. She hadquite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawfordjoined them. The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite soabsolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room; for once or twice alook seemed forced on her which she did not know how to class among thecommon meaning; in any other man, at least, she would have said thatit meant something very earnest, very pointed. But she still tried tobelieve it no more than what he might often have expressed towards hercousins and fifty other women.She thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest. Shefancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals, wheneverSir Thomas was out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris, andshe carefully refused him every opportunity.At last--it seemed an at last to Fanny's nervousness, though notremarkably late--he began to talk of going away; but the comfort of thesound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment, and saying,""Have you nothing to send to Mary? No answer to her note? She will bedisappointed if she receives nothing from you. Pray write to her, if itbe only a line.""""Oh yes! certainly,"" cried Fanny, rising in haste, the haste ofembarrassment and of wanting to get away--""I will write directly.""She went accordingly to the table, where she was in the habit of writingfor her aunt, and prepared her materials without knowing what in theworld to say. She had read Miss Crawford's note only once, and how toreply to anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing.Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had there been time forscruples and fears as to style she would have felt them in abundance:but something must be instantly written; and with only one decidedfeeling, that of wishing not to appear to think anything reallyintended, she wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and hand--""I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kindcongratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William. The restof your note I know means nothing; but I am so unequal to anything ofthe sort, that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farthernotice. I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand hismanners; if he understood me as well, he would, I dare say, behavedifferently. I do not know what I write, but it would be a great favourof you never to mention the subject again. With thanks for the honour ofyour note, I remain, dear Miss Crawford, etc., etc.""The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, forshe found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, wascoming towards her.""You cannot think I mean to hurry you,"" said he, in an undervoice,perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note, ""youcannot think I have any such object. Do not hurry yourself, I entreat.""""Oh! I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in amoment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to give_that_ to Miss Crawford.""The note was held out, and must be taken; and as she instantly and withaverted eyes walked towards the fireplace, where sat the others, he hadnothing to do but to go in good earnest.Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation, both ofpain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to diewith the day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William'sadvancement, whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more. She hadno doubt that her note must appear excessively ill-written, thatthe language would disgrace a child, for her distress had allowed noarrangement; but at least it would assure them both of her being neitherimposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford's attentions."
Mansfield Park,32,"CHAPTER XXXIIFanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she awoke the nextmorning; but she remembered the purport of her note, and was not lesssanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before. If Mr.Crawford would but go away! That was what she most earnestly desired:go and take his sister with him, as he was to do, and as he returned toMansfield on purpose to do. And why it was not done already she couldnot devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay. Fanny hadhoped, in the course of his yesterday's visit, to hear the day named;but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place erelong.Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey,she could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford, as she accidentallydid, coming up to the house again, and at an hour as early as the daybefore. His coming might have nothing to do with her, but she must avoidseeing him if possible; and being then on her way upstairs, she resolvedthere to remain, during the whole of his visit, unless actually sentfor; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house, there seemed littledanger of her being wanted.She sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening, trembling, andfearing to be sent for every moment; but as no footsteps approached theEast room, she grew gradually composed, could sit down, and be able toemploy herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and would gowithout her being obliged to know anything of the matter.Nearly half an hour had passed, and she was growing very comfortable,when suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard; a heavystep, an unusual step in that part of the house: it was her uncle's; sheknew it as well as his voice; she had trembled at it as often, and beganto tremble again, at the idea of his coming up to speak to her, whatevermight be the subject. It was indeed Sir Thomas who opened the door andasked if she were there, and if he might come in. The terror of hisformer occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed, and she feltas if he were going to examine her again in French and English.She was all attention, however, in placing a chair for him, and tryingto appear honoured; and, in her agitation, had quite overlooked thedeficiencies of her apartment, till he, stopping short as he entered,said, with much surprise, ""Why have you no fire to-day?""There was snow on the ground, and she was sitting in a shawl. Shehesitated.""I am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year.""""But you have a fire in general?""""No, sir.""""How comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that youhad the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable.In your bedchamber I know you _cannot_ have a fire. Here is some greatmisapprehension which must be rectified. It is highly unfit for you tosit, be it only half an hour a day, without a fire. You are not strong.You are chilly. Your aunt cannot be aware of this.""Fanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, shecould not forbear, in justice to the aunt she loved best, from sayingsomething in which the words ""my aunt Norris"" were distinguishable.""I understand,"" cried her uncle, recollecting himself, and not wantingto hear more: ""I understand. Your aunt Norris has always been anadvocate, and very judiciously, for young people's being brought upwithout unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation ineverything. She is also very hardy herself, which of course willinfluence her in her opinion of the wants of others. And on anotheraccount, too, I can perfectly comprehend. I know what her sentimentshave always been. The principle was good in itself, but it may havebeen, and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case. Iam aware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaceddistinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you willever harbour resentment on that account. You have an understandingwhich will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judgingpartially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, youwill consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that_they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing youfor that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot. Thoughtheir caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant; andof this you may be assured, that every advantage of affluence will bedoubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have beenimposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by failingat any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and attentionthat are due to her. But enough of this. Sit down, my dear. I must speakto you for a few minutes, but I will not detain you long.""Fanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising. After a moment'spause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress a smile, went on.""You are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor this morning. Ihad not been long in my own room, after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford wasshewn in. His errand you may probably conjecture.""Fanny's colour grew deeper and deeper; and her uncle, perceiving thatshe was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or lookingup quite impossible, turned away his own eyes, and without any fartherpause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford's visit.Mr. Crawford's business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny,make decided proposals for her, and entreat the sanction of the uncle,who seemed to stand in the place of her parents; and he had done it allso well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas, feeling,moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been very muchto the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of theirconversation; and little aware of what was passing in his niece's mind,conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more thanhimself. He talked, therefore, for several minutes without Fanny'sdaring to interrupt him. She had hardly even attained the wish to do it.Her mind was in too much confusion. She had changed her position; and,with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows, was listening to heruncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay. For a moment he ceased, butshe had barely become conscious of it, when, rising from his chair, hesaid, ""And now, Fanny, having performed one part of my commission,and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured andsatisfactory, I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you toaccompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot but presume on havingbeen no unacceptable companion myself, I must submit to your findingone still better worth listening to. Mr. Crawford, as you have perhapsforeseen, is yet in the house. He is in my room, and hoping to see youthere.""There was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this, whichastonished Sir Thomas; but what was his increase of astonishment onhearing her exclaim--""Oh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down tohim. Mr. Crawford ought to know--he must know that: I told him enoughyesterday to convince him; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday,and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me, andquite out of my power to return his good opinion.""""I do not catch your meaning,"" said Sir Thomas, sitting down again. ""Outof your power to return his good opinion? What is all this? I know hespoke to you yesterday, and (as far as I understand) received as muchencouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman could permitherself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected to havebeen your behaviour on the occasion; it shewed a discretion highly tobe commended. But now, when he has made his overtures so properly, andhonourably--what are your scruples _now_?""""You are mistaken, sir,"" cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety of themoment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong; ""you are quitemistaken. How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him noencouragement yesterday. On the contrary, I told him, I cannot recollectmy exact words, but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him,that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and that I beggedhim never to talk to me in that manner again. I am sure I said as muchas that and more; and I should have said still more, if I had been quitecertain of his meaning anything seriously; but I did not like to be, Icould not bear to be, imputing more than might be intended. I thought itmight all pass for nothing with _him_.""She could say no more; her breath was almost gone.""Am I to understand,"" said Sir Thomas, after a few moments' silence,""that you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?""""Yes, sir.""""Refuse him?""""Yes, sir.""""Refuse Mr. Crawford! Upon what plea? For what reason?""""I--I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him.""""This is very strange!"" said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm displeasure.""There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach. Hereis a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you, with everything torecommend him: not merely situation in life, fortune, and character,but with more than common agreeableness, with address and conversationpleasing to everybody. And he is not an acquaintance of to-day; you havenow known him some time. His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend,and he has been doing _that_ for your brother, which I should supposewould have been almost sufficient recommendation to you, had there beenno other. It is very uncertain when my interest might have got Williamon. He has done it already.""""Yes,"" said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down with fresh shame;and she did feel almost ashamed of herself, after such a picture as heruncle had drawn, for not liking Mr. Crawford.""You must have been aware,"" continued Sir Thomas presently, ""you musthave been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford's mannersto you. This cannot have taken you by surprise. You must have observedhis attentions; and though you always received them very properly (Ihave no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to beunpleasant to you. I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do notquite know your own feelings.""""Oh yes, sir! indeed I do. His attentions were always--what I did notlike.""Sir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise. ""This is beyond me,""said he. ""This requires explanation. Young as you are, and having seenscarcely any one, it is hardly possible that your affections--""He paused and eyed her fixedly. He saw her lips formed into a _no_,though the sound was inarticulate, but her face was like scarlet. That,however, in so modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;and chusing at least to appear satisfied, he quickly added, ""No, no, Iknow _that_ is quite out of the question; quite impossible. Well, thereis nothing more to be said.""And for a few minutes he did say nothing. He was deep in thought. Hisniece was deep in thought likewise, trying to harden and prepare herselfagainst farther questioning. She would rather die than own the truth;and she hoped, by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyondbetraying it.""Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford's _choice_ seemed tojustify"" said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, ""hiswishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am anadvocate for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, andwould have every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soonafter four-and-twenty as he can. This is so much my opinion, that I amsorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr.Bertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge,matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts. I wish he were morelikely to fix."" Here was a glance at Fanny. ""Edmund, I consider, fromhis dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early thanhis brother. _He_, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman hecould love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right? Doyou agree with me, my dear?""""Yes, sir.""It was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on thescore of the cousins. But the removal of his alarm did his nieceno service: as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasureincreased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown, whichFanny could picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her eyes,he shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, ""Have you anyreason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford's temper?""""No, sir.""She longed to add, ""But of his principles I have""; but her heart sunkunder the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probablynon-conviction. Her ill opinion of him was founded chiefly onobservations, which, for her cousins' sake, she could scarcely daremention to their father. Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were soclosely implicated in Mr. Crawford's misconduct, that she could not givehis character, such as she believed it, without betraying them. She hadhoped that, to a man like her uncle, so discerning, so honourable, sogood, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_ on her side wouldhave been sufficient. To her infinite grief she found it was not.Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in tremblingwretchedness, and with a good deal of cold sternness, said, ""It is of nouse, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this mostmortifying conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting. Iwill, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion ofyour conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed,and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I hadsupposed. For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have shewn,formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return toEngland. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper,self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit whichprevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which in youngwomen is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence. But youhave now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you can andwill decide for yourself, without any consideration or deference forthose who have surely some right to guide you, without even asking theiradvice. You have shewn yourself very, very different from anything thatI had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of your family, of yourparents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to have had a moment'sshare in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_ might be benefited,how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment for you, is nothing to_you_. You think only of yourself, and because you do not feel for Mr.Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary forhappiness, you resolve to refuse him at once, without wishing even fora little time to consider of it, a little more time for coolconsideration, and for really examining your own inclinations; and are,in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from you such an opportunity ofbeing settled in life, eligibly, honourably, nobly settled, as will,probably, never occur to you again. Here is a young man of sense, ofcharacter, of temper, of manners, and of fortune, exceedingly attachedto you, and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterestedway; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you may live eighteen years longerin the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford'sestate, or a tenth part of his merits. Gladly would I have bestowedeither of my own daughters on him. Maria is nobly married; but hadMr. Crawford sought Julia's hand, I should have given it to him withsuperior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria's to Mr.Rushworth."" After half a moment's pause: ""And I should have been verymuch surprised had either of my daughters, on receiving a proposalof marriage at any time which might carry with it only _half_ theeligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily, and without payingmy opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation, put adecided negative on it. I should have been much surprised and much hurtby such a proceeding. I should have thought it a gross violation of dutyand respect. _You_ are not to be judged by the same rule. You do notowe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if your heart can acquit you of_ingratitude_--""He ceased. Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as hewas, he would not press that article farther. Her heart was almost brokeby such a picture of what she appeared to him; by such accusations,so heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation! Self-willed,obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful. He thought her all this. She haddeceived his expectations; she had lost his good opinion. What was tobecome of her?""I am very sorry,"" said she inarticulately, through her tears, ""I amvery sorry indeed.""""Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason tobe long sorry for this day's transactions.""""If it were possible for me to do otherwise"" said she, with anotherstrong effort; ""but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never makehim happy, and that I should be miserable myself.""Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of thatgreat black word _miserable_, which served to introduce it, Sir Thomasbegan to think a little relenting, a little change of inclination, mighthave something to do with it; and to augur favourably from the personalentreaty of the young man himself. He knew her to be very timid, andexceedingly nervous; and thought it not improbable that her mindmight be in such a state as a little time, a little pressing, a littlepatience, and a little impatience, a judicious mixture of all on thelover's side, might work their usual effect on. If the gentleman wouldbut persevere, if he had but love enough to persevere, Sir Thomas beganto have hopes; and these reflections having passed across his mind andcheered it, ""Well,"" said he, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of lessanger, ""well, child, dry up your tears. There is no use in these tears;they can do no good. You must now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawfordhas been kept waiting too long already. You must give him your ownanswer: we cannot expect him to be satisfied with less; and you onlycan explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments,which, unfortunately for himself, he certainly has imbibed. I am totallyunequal to it.""But Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going downto him, that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it betterto indulge her. His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a smalldepression in consequence; but when he looked at his niece, and saw thestate of feature and complexion which her crying had brought herinto, he thought there might be as much lost as gained by an immediateinterview. With a few words, therefore, of no particular meaning, hewalked off by himself, leaving his poor niece to sit and cry over whathad passed, with very wretched feelings.Her mind was all disorder. The past, present, future, everything wasterrible. But her uncle's anger gave her the severest pain of all.Selfish and ungrateful! to have appeared so to him! She was miserablefor ever. She had no one to take her part, to counsel, or speak for her.Her only friend was absent. He might have softened his father; but all,perhaps all, would think her selfish and ungrateful. She might have toendure the reproach again and again; she might hear it, or see it, orknow it to exist for ever in every connexion about her. She could notbut feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he really lovedher, and were unhappy too! It was all wretchedness together.In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned; she was almostready to faint at the sight of him. He spoke calmly, however, withoutausterity, without reproach, and she revived a little. There wascomfort, too, in his words, as well as his manner, for he began with,""Mr. Crawford is gone: he has just left me. I need not repeat what haspassed. I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling, by anaccount of what he has felt. Suffice it, that he has behaved in themost gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a mostfavourable opinion of his understanding, heart, and temper. Upon myrepresentation of what you were suffering, he immediately, and with thegreatest delicacy, ceased to urge to see you for the present.""Here Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again. ""Of course,"" continuedher uncle, ""it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speakwith you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too natural,a claim too just to be denied. But there is no time fixed; perhapsto-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough. For the presentyou have only to tranquillise yourself. Check these tears; they do butexhaust you. If, as I am willing to suppose, you wish to shew me anyobservance, you will not give way to these emotions, but endeavour toreason yourself into a stronger frame of mind. I advise you to go out:the air will do you good; go out for an hour on the gravel; you willhave the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the better for air andexercise. And, Fanny"" (turning back again for a moment), ""I shall makeno mention below of what has passed; I shall not even tell your auntBertram. There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment; saynothing about it yourself.""This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was an act ofkindness which Fanny felt at her heart. To be spared from her auntNorris's interminable reproaches! he left her in a glow of gratitude.Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches. Even to see Mr.Crawford would be less overpowering.She walked out directly, as her uncle recommended, and followed hisadvice throughout, as far as she could; did check her tears; didearnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind. She wishedto prove to him that she did desire his comfort, and sought to regainhis favour; and he had given her another strong motive for exertion, inkeeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts. Not to excitesuspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth attaining; andshe felt equal to almost anything that might save her from her auntNorris.She was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her walk and goinginto the East room again, the first thing which caught her eye was afire lighted and burning. A fire! it seemed too much; just at that timeto be giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude.She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of such atrifle again; but she soon found, from the voluntary information of thehousemaid, who came in to attend it, that so it was to be every day. SirThomas had given orders for it.""I must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!"" said she, insoliloquy. ""Heaven defend me from being ungrateful!""She saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt Norris, till they metat dinner. Her uncle's behaviour to her was then as nearly as possiblewhat it had been before; she was sure he did not mean there should beany change, and that it was only her own conscience that could fancyany; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her; and when she found howmuch and how unpleasantly her having only walked out without her aunt'sknowledge could be dwelt on, she felt all the reason she had to blessthe kindness which saved her from the same spirit of reproach, exertedon a more momentous subject.""If I had known you were going out, I should have got you just to goas far as my house with some orders for Nanny,"" said she, ""which I havesince, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carrymyself. I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me thetrouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us know you weregoing out. It would have made no difference to you, I suppose, whetheryou had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house.""""I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,"" said SirThomas.""Oh!"" said Mrs. Norris, with a moment's check, ""that was very kind ofyou, Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house.Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with theadvantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt: it is all herfault. If she would but have let us know she was going out but there isa something about Fanny, I have often observed it before--she likes togo her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takesher own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a littlespirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which Iwould advise her to get the better of.""As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could bemore unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same sentimentshimself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried repeatedlybefore he could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough toperceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he thoughtwell of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have his ownchildren's merits set off by the depreciation of hers. She was talking_at_ Fanny, and resenting this private walk half through the dinner.It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with morecomposure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits than she couldhave hoped for after so stormy a morning; but she trusted, in the firstplace, that she had done right: that her judgment had not misled her.For the purity of her intentions she could answer; and she was willingto hope, secondly, that her uncle's displeasure was abating, and wouldabate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality, andfelt, as a good man must feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, howhopeless, and how wicked it was to marry without affection.When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past,she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finallyconcluded, and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield, that everythingwould soon be as if no such subject had existed. She would not, couldnot believe, that Mr. Crawford's affection for her could distress himlong; his mind was not of that sort. London would soon bring its cure.In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation, and bethankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evilconsequences.While Fanny's mind was engaged in these sort of hopes, her uncle was,soon after tea, called out of the room; an occurrence too common tostrike her, and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared tenminutes afterwards, and advancing decidedly towards herself, said,""Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you, ma'am, in his own room."" Then itoccurred to her what might be going on; a suspicion rushed over her mindwhich drove the colour from her cheeks; but instantly rising, she waspreparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris called out, ""Stay, stay, Fanny! whatare you about? where are you going? don't be in such a hurry. Dependupon it, it is not you who are wanted; depend upon it, it is me""(looking at the butler); ""but you are so very eager to put yourselfforward. What should Sir Thomas want you for? It is me, Baddeley, youmean; I am coming this moment. You mean me, Baddeley, I am sure; SirThomas wants me, not Miss Price.""But Baddeley was stout. ""No, ma'am, it is Miss Price; I am certain ofits being Miss Price."" And there was a half-smile with the words, whichmeant, ""I do not think you would answer the purpose at all.""Mrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to workagain; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found herself,as she anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford."
Mansfield Park,33,"CHAPTER XXXIIIThe conference was neither so short nor so conclusive as the lady haddesigned. The gentleman was not so easily satisfied. He had all thedisposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him. He had vanity,which strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did lovehim, though she might not know it herself; and which, secondly, whenconstrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings,convinced him that he should be able in time to make those feelings whathe wished.He was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operatingon an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made heraffection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, anddetermined him to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcingher to love him.He would not despair: he would not desist. He had every well-groundedreason for solid attachment; he knew her to have all the worth thatcould justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her; herconduct at this very time, by speaking the disinterestedness anddelicacy of her character (qualities which he believed most rareindeed), was of a sort to heighten all his wishes, and confirm all hisresolutions. He knew not that he had a pre-engaged heart to attack.Of _that_ he had no suspicion. He considered her rather as one whohad never thought on the subject enough to be in danger; who had beenguarded by youth, a youth of mind as lovely as of person; whose modestyhad prevented her from understanding his attentions, and who was stilloverpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected, and thenovelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into account.Must it not follow of course, that, when he was understood, he shouldsucceed? He believed it fully. Love such as his, in a man like himself,must with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; andhe had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a veryshort time, that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted. A littledifficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He ratherderived spirits from it. He had been apt to gain hearts too easily. Hissituation was new and animating.To Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her life tofind any charm in it, all this was unintelligible. She found that he didmean to persevere; but how he could, after such language from her as shefelt herself obliged to use, was not to be understood. She told him thatshe did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never should lovehim; that such a change was quite impossible; that the subject was mostpainful to her; that she must entreat him never to mention it again, toallow her to leave him at once, and let it be considered as concludedfor ever. And when farther pressed, had added, that in her opinion theirdispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affectionincompatible; and that they were unfitted for each other by nature,education, and habit. All this she had said, and with the earnestnessof sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he immediately denied therebeing anything uncongenial in their characters, or anything unfriendlyin their situations; and positively declared, that he would still love,and still hope!Fanny knew her own meaning, but was no judge of her own manner. Hermanner was incurably gentle; and she was not aware how much it concealedthe sternness of her purpose. Her diffidence, gratitude, and softnessmade every expression of indifference seem almost an effort ofself-denial; seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to herselfas to him. Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as theclandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had beenher abhorrence, whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom shecould believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of beingagreeable, she had barely acknowledged. He was now the Mr. Crawford whowas addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love; whose feelingswere apparently become all that was honourable and upright, whose viewsof happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment; who waspouring out his sense of her merits, describing and describing again hisaffection, proving as far as words could prove it, and in the language,tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he sought her for hergentleness and her goodness; and to complete the whole, he was now theMr. Crawford who had procured William's promotion!Here was a change, and here were claims which could not but operate!She might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue, inthe grounds of Sotherton, or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but heapproached her now with rights that demanded different treatment.She must be courteous, and she must be compassionate. She must havea sensation of being honoured, and whether thinking of herself or herbrother, she must have a strong feeling of gratitude. The effect of thewhole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled withher refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper ofvanity and hope like Crawford's, the truth, or at least the strengthof her indifference, might well be questionable; and he was not soirrational as Fanny considered him, in the professions of persevering,assiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed the interview.It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go; but there was no lookof despair in parting to belie his words, or give her hopes of his beingless unreasonable than he professed himself.Now she was angry. Some resentment did arise at a perseverance soselfish and ungenerous. Here was again a want of delicacy and regard forothers which had formerly so struck and disgusted her. Here was againa something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before.How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where hisown pleasure was concerned; and alas! how always known no principle tosupply as a duty what the heart was deficient in! Had her own affectionsbeen as free as perhaps they ought to have been, he never could haveengaged them.So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she sat musingover that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wonderingat the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in anervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion ofher being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, andthe felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.Sir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till the morrow fora knowledge of what had passed between the young people. He then sawMr. Crawford, and received his account. The first feeling wasdisappointment: he had hoped better things; he had thought that anhour's entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked solittle change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was speedycomfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover;and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal, Sir Thomaswas soon able to depend on it himself.Nothing was omitted, on his side, of civility, compliment, or kindness,that might assist the plan. Mr. Crawford's steadiness was honoured, andFanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in theworld. At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he hadonly to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of hisvisits, at present or in future. In all his niece's family and friends,there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influenceof all who loved her must incline one way.Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement receivedwith grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper andhopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunitywith his niece, and to shew no open interference. Upon her dispositionhe believed kindness might be the best way of working. Entreaty shouldbe from one quarter only. The forbearance of her family on a point,respecting which she could be in no doubt of their wishes, might betheir surest means of forwarding it. Accordingly, on this principle, SirThomas took the first opportunity of saying to her, with a mild gravity,intended to be overcoming, ""Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr. Crawford again,and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you. He is a mostextraordinary young man, and whatever be the event, you must feel thatyou have created an attachment of no common character; though, youngas you are, and little acquainted with the transient, varying, unsteadynature of love, as it generally exists, you cannot be struck as Iam with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort againstdiscouragement. With him it is entirely a matter of feeling: he claimsno merit in it; perhaps is entitled to none. Yet, having chosen sowell, his constancy has a respectable stamp. Had his choice been lessunexceptionable, I should have condemned his persevering.""""Indeed, sir,"" said Fanny, ""I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford shouldcontinue to know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and Ifeel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and Ihave told him so, that it never will be in my power--""""My dear,"" interrupted Sir Thomas, ""there is no occasion for this. Yourfeelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must beto you. There is nothing more to be said or done. From this hour thesubject is never to be revived between us. You will have nothing tofear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose me capable of tryingto persuade you to marry against your inclinations. Your happiness andadvantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of youbut to bear with Mr. Crawford's endeavours to convince you that they maynot be incompatible with his. He proceeds at his own risk. You are onsafe ground. I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls, asyou might have done had nothing of this sort occurred. You will seehim with the rest of us, in the same manner, and, as much as youcan, dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant. He leavesNorthamptonshire so soon, that even this slight sacrifice cannot beoften demanded. The future must be very uncertain. And now, my dearFanny, this subject is closed between us.""The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with muchsatisfaction. Her uncle's kind expressions, however, and forbearingmanner, were sensibly felt; and when she considered how much of thetruth was unknown to him, she believed she had no right to wonder atthe line of conduct he pursued. He, who had married a daughter to Mr.Rushworth: romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him.She must do her duty, and trust that time might make her duty easierthan it now was.She could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford's attachmentwould hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady,unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.How much time she might, in her own fancy, allot for its dominion, isanother concern. It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady'sexact estimate of her own perfections.In spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once moreobliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare her briefly forits being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still haveavoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totallyopposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. Hehad no idea of concealment. It was all known at the Parsonage, wherehe loved to talk over the future with both his sisters, and it would berather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progressof his success. When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessityof making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the businesswithout delay; though, on Fanny's account, he almost dreaded theeffect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself. Hedeprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal. Sir Thomas, indeed, was,by this time, not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of thosewell-meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeablethings.Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him. He pressed for the strictestforbearance and silence towards their niece; she not only promised, butdid observe it. She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was:bitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for having receivedsuch an offer than for refusing it. It was an injury and affront toJulia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford's choice; and, independentlyof that, she disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her; and shewould have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been alwaystrying to depress.Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than shedeserved; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to seeher displeasure, and not to hear it.Lady Bertram took it differently. She had been a beauty, and aprosperous beauty, all her life; and beauty and wealth were all thatexcited her respect. To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man offortune, raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion. By convincingher that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she had been doubting aboutbefore, and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel asort of credit in calling her niece.""Well, Fanny,"" said she, as soon as they were alone together afterwards,and she really had known something like impatience to be alone with her,and her countenance, as she spoke, had extraordinary animation; ""Well,Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning. I must justspeak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must _once_, and then Ishall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece."" And looking at hercomplacently, she added, ""Humph, we certainly are a handsome family!""Fanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say; when, hoping to assailher on her vulnerable side, she presently answered--""My dear aunt, _you_ cannot wish me to do differently from what I havedone, I am sure. _You_ cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me,should not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that.""""No, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when such an offer asthis comes in your way. I could do very well without you, if you weremarried to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford. And you must beaware, Fanny, that it is every young woman's duty to accept such a veryunexceptionable offer as this.""This was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece of advice,which Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight yearsand a half. It silenced her. She felt how unprofitable contention wouldbe. If her aunt's feelings were against her, nothing could be hoped fromattacking her understanding. Lady Bertram was quite talkative.""I will tell you what, Fanny,"" said she, ""I am sure he fell in love withyou at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You didlook remarkably well. Everybody said so. Sir Thomas said so. And youknow you had Chapman to help you to dress. I am very glad I sentChapman to you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was donethat evening."" And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she soonafterwards added, ""And will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than Idid for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy."""
Mansfield Park,34,"CHAPTER XXXIVEdmund had great things to hear on his return. Many surprises wereawaiting him. The first that occurred was not least in interest: theappearance of Henry Crawford and his sister walking together through thevillage as he rode into it. He had concluded--he had meant them to befar distant. His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposelyto avoid Miss Crawford. He was returning to Mansfield with spirits readyto feed on melancholy remembrances, and tender associations, when herown fair self was before him, leaning on her brother's arm, and he foundhimself receiving a welcome, unquestionably friendly, from the womanwhom, two moments before, he had been thinking of as seventy miles off,and as farther, much farther, from him in inclination than any distancecould express.Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hopedfor, had he expected to see her. Coming as he did from such a purportfulfilled as had taken him away, he would have expected anything ratherthan a look of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning.It was enough to set his heart in a glow, and to bring him home in theproperest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful surprisesat hand.William's promotion, with all its particulars, he was soon master of;and with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast tohelp the joy, he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation andunvarying cheerfulness all dinner-time.After dinner, when he and his father were alone, he had Fanny's history;and then all the great events of the last fortnight, and the presentsituation of matters at Mansfield were known to him.Fanny suspected what was going on. They sat so much longer than usual inthe dining-parlour, that she was sure they must be talking of her; andwhen tea at last brought them away, and she was to be seen by Edmundagain, she felt dreadfully guilty. He came to her, sat down by her, tookher hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment she thought that,but for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things afforded, shemust have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess.He was not intending, however, by such action, to be conveying to herthat unqualified approbation and encouragement which her hopes drewfrom it. It was designed only to express his participation in all thatinterested her, and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickenedevery feeling of affection. He was, in fact, entirely on his father'sside of the question. His surprise was not so great as his father's ather refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing her to considerhim with anything like a preference, he had always believed it tobe rather the reverse, and could imagine her to be taken perfectlyunprepared, but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as moredesirable than he did. It had every recommendation to him; and whilehonouring her for what she had done under the influence of her presentindifference, honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomascould quite echo, he was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine inbelieving, that it would be a match at last, and that, united by mutualaffection, it would appear that their dispositions were as exactlyfitted to make them blessed in each other, as he was now beginningseriously to consider them. Crawford had been too precipitate. He hadnot given her time to attach herself. He had begun at the wrong end.With such powers as his, however, and such a disposition as hers, Edmundtrusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion. Meanwhile,he saw enough of Fanny's embarrassment to make him scrupulously guardagainst exciting it a second time, by any word, or look, or movement.Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund's return, SirThomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it wasreally a necessary compliment. He staid of course, and Edmund had thenample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what degreeof immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners;and it was so little, so very, very little--every chance, everypossibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there wasnot hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else--that he wasalmost ready to wonder at his friend's perseverance. Fanny was worth itall; he held her to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion ofmind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any womanbreathing, without something more to warm his courage than his eyescould discern in hers. He was very willing to hope that Crawford sawclearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friendthat he could come to from all that he observed to pass before, and at,and after dinner.In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought morepromising. When he and Crawford walked into the drawing-room, his motherand Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if therewere nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing theirapparently deep tranquillity.""We have not been so silent all the time,"" replied his mother. ""Fannyhas been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing youcoming."" And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the airof being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. ""She oftenreads to me out of those books; and she was in the middle of a veryfine speech of that man's--what's his name, Fanny?--when we heard yourfootsteps.""Crawford took the volume. ""Let me have the pleasure of finishing thatspeech to your ladyship,"" said he. ""I shall find it immediately."" And bycarefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves, he did find it,or within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram, whoassured him, as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey, thathe had got the very speech. Not a look or an offer of help had Fannygiven; not a syllable for or against. All her attention was for herwork. She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But tastewas too strong in her. She could not abstract her mind five minutes: shewas forced to listen; his reading was capital, and her pleasure in goodreading extreme. To _good_ reading, however, she had been long used:her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well, but in Mr.Crawford's reading there was a variety of excellence beyond what she hadever met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey, Cromwell, allwere given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the happiest power ofjumping and guessing, he could always alight at will on the best scene,or the best speeches of each; and whether it were dignity, or pride, ortenderness, or remorse, or whatever were to be expressed, he could doit with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His acting had first taughtFanny what pleasure a play might give, and his reading brought all hisacting before her again; nay, perhaps with greater enjoyment, for itcame unexpectedly, and with no such drawback as she had been used tosuffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss Bertram.Edmund watched the progress of her attention, and was amused andgratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework, whichat the beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from her handwhile she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes which hadappeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned andfixed on Crawford--fixed on him for minutes, fixed on him, in short,till the attraction drew Crawford's upon her, and the book was closed,and the charm was broken. Then she was shrinking again into herself,and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been enough to giveEdmund encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially thanked him, hehoped to be expressing Fanny's secret feelings too.""That play must be a favourite with you,"" said he; ""you read as if youknew it well.""""It will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour,"" replied Crawford;""but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand beforesince I was fifteen. I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I have heardof it from somebody who did, I am not certain which. But Shakespeareone gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part of anEnglishman's constitution. His thoughts and beauties are so spreadabroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him byinstinct. No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of hisplays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately.""""No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,"" said Edmund,""from one's earliest years. His celebrated passages are quotedby everybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talkShakespeare, use his similes, and describe with his descriptions; butthis is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it. To knowhim in bits and scraps is common enough; to know him pretty thoroughlyis, perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him well aloud is no everydaytalent.""""Sir, you do me honour,"" was Crawford's answer, with a bow of mockgravity.Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word of accordantpraise could be extorted from her; yet both feeling that it could notbe. Her praise had been given in her attention; _that_ must contentthem.Lady Bertram's admiration was expressed, and strongly too. ""It wasreally like being at a play,"" said she. ""I wish Sir Thomas had beenhere.""Crawford was excessively pleased. If Lady Bertram, with all herincompetency and languor, could feel this, the inference of what herniece, alive and enlightened as she was, must feel, was elevating.""You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,"" said herladyship soon afterwards; ""and I will tell you what, I think you willhave a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk. I meanwhen you are settled there. I do indeed. I think you will fit up atheatre at your house in Norfolk.""""Do you, ma'am?"" cried he, with quickness. ""No, no, that will never be.Your ladyship is quite mistaken. No theatre at Everingham! Oh no!"" Andhe looked at Fanny with an expressive smile, which evidently meant,""That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham.""Edmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined _not_ to see it, as tomake it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning ofthe protestation; and such a quick consciousness of compliment, such aready comprehension of a hint, he thought, was rather favourable thannot.The subject of reading aloud was farther discussed. The two young menwere the only talkers, but they, standing by the fire, talked over thetoo common neglect of the qualification, the total inattention to it,in the ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural, yet insome instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance and uncouthnessof men, of sensible and well-informed men, when suddenly called to thenecessity of reading aloud, which had fallen within their notice, givinginstances of blunders, and failures with their secondary causes, thewant of management of the voice, of proper modulation and emphasis, offoresight and judgment, all proceeding from the first cause: want ofearly attention and habit; and Fanny was listening again with greatentertainment.""Even in my profession,"" said Edmund, with a smile, ""how little theart of reading has been studied! how little a clear manner, and gooddelivery, have been attended to! I speak rather of the past, however,than the present. There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but amongthose who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago, the largernumber, to judge by their performance, must have thought reading wasreading, and preaching was preaching. It is different now. The subjectis more justly considered. It is felt that distinctness and energy mayhave weight in recommending the most solid truths; and besides, there ismore general observation and taste, a more critical knowledge diffusedthan formerly; in every congregation there is a larger proportion whoknow a little of the matter, and who can judge and criticise.""Edmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination;and upon this being understood, he had a variety of questions fromCrawford as to his feelings and success; questions, which being made,though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, withoutany touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew tobe most offensive to Fanny, he had true pleasure in satisfying; andwhen Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to theproperest manner in which particular passages in the service should bedelivered, shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before,and thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and more pleased. Thiswould be the way to Fanny's heart. She was not to be won by all thatgallantry and wit and good-nature together could do; or, at least,she would not be won by them nearly so soon, without the assistance ofsentiment and feeling, and seriousness on serious subjects.""Our liturgy,"" observed Crawford, ""has beauties, which not even acareless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; but it has alsoredundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt.For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as Iought to be"" (here was a glance at Fanny); ""that nineteen times out oftwenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing tohave it to read myself. Did you speak?"" stepping eagerly to Fanny, andaddressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying ""No,"" he added,""Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied youmight be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not _allow_my thoughts to wander. Are not you going to tell me so?""""No, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to--even supposing--""She stopt, felt herself getting into a puzzle, and could not beprevailed on to add another word, not by dint of several minutes ofsupplication and waiting. He then returned to his former station, andwent on as if there had been no such tender interruption.""A sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers well read.A sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing. It is more difficultto speak well than to compose well; that is, the rules and trick ofcomposition are oftener an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon,thoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hearsuch a one without the greatest admiration and respect, and more thanhalf a mind to take orders and preach myself. There is something in theeloquence of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitledto the highest praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affectsuch an heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects limited, and longworn threadbare in all common hands; who can say anything new orstriking, anything that rouses the attention without offending thetaste, or wearing out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom onecould not, in his public capacity, honour enough. I should like to besuch a man.""Edmund laughed.""I should indeed. I never listened to a distinguished preacher in mylife without a sort of envy. But then, I must have a London audience.I could not preach but to the educated; to those who were capable ofestimating my composition. And I do not know that I should be fond ofpreaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; butnot for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.""Here Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head,and Crawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know hermeaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and sittingdown close by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack, that looksand undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as possibleinto a corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very sincerelywishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining awaythat shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover; and asearnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself inmurmurs of his own, over the various advertisements of ""A most desirableEstate in South Wales""; ""To Parents and Guardians""; and a ""Capitalseason'd Hunter.""Fanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionlessas she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund'sarrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her modest,gentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks andinquiries; and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.""What did that shake of the head mean?"" said he. ""What was it meant toexpress? Disapprobation, I fear. But of what? What had I been sayingto displease you? Did you think me speaking improperly, lightly,irreverently on the subject? Only tell me if I was. Only tell me ifI was wrong. I want to be set right. Nay, nay, I entreat you; for onemoment put down your work. What did that shake of the head mean?""In vain was her ""Pray, sir, don't; pray, Mr. Crawford,"" repeated twiceover; and in vain did she try to move away. In the same low, eagervoice, and the same close neighbourhood, he went on, reurging the samequestions as before. She grew more agitated and displeased.""How can you, sir? You quite astonish me; I wonder how you can--""""Do I astonish you?"" said he. ""Do you wonder? Is there anything inmy present entreaty that you do not understand? I will explain to youinstantly all that makes me urge you in this manner, all that gives mean interest in what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity. Iwill not leave you to wonder long.""In spite of herself, she could not help half a smile, but she saidnothing.""You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like toengage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy. Yes, thatwas the word. Constancy: I am not afraid of the word. I would spell it,read it, write it with anybody. I see nothing alarming in the word. Didyou think I ought?""""Perhaps, sir,"" said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking--""perhaps,sir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well asyou seemed to do at that moment.""Crawford, delighted to get her to speak at any rate, was determinedto keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to silence him by such anextremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was onlya change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another.He had always something to entreat the explanation of. The opportunitywas too fair. None such had occurred since his seeing her in her uncle'sroom, none such might occur again before his leaving Mansfield. LadyBertram's being just on the other side of the table was a trifle,for she might always be considered as only half-awake, and Edmund'sadvertisements were still of the first utility.""Well,"" said Crawford, after a course of rapid questions and reluctantanswers; ""I am happier than I was, because I now understand more clearlyyour opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the whim ofthe moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an opinion, nowonder that. But we shall see. It is not by protestations that I shallendeavour to convince you I am wronged; it is not by telling you that myaffections are steady. My conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance,time shall speak for me. _They_ shall prove that, as far as you can bedeserved by anybody, I do deserve you. You are infinitely my superiorin merit; all _that_ I know. You have qualities which I had not beforesupposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature. You have sometouches of the angel in you beyond what--not merely beyond what onesees, because one never sees anything like it--but beyond what onefancies might be. But still I am not frightened. It is not by equalityof merit that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is hewho sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you mostdevotedly, that has the best right to a return. There I build myconfidence. By that right I do and will deserve you; and when onceconvinced that my attachment is what I declare it, I know you too wellnot to entertain the warmest hopes. Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay""(seeing her draw back displeased), ""forgive me. Perhaps I have as yetno right; but by what other name can I call you? Do you suppose you areever present to my imagination under any other? No, it is 'Fanny' thatI think of all day, and dream of all night. You have given the name suchreality of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive of you.""Fanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer, or have refrained fromat least trying to get away in spite of all the too public oppositionshe foresaw to it, had it not been for the sound of approaching relief,the very sound which she had been long watching for, and long thinkingstrangely delayed.The solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of tea-board, urn, andcake-bearers, made its appearance, and delivered her from a grievousimprisonment of body and mind. Mr. Crawford was obliged to move. She wasat liberty, she was busy, she was protected.Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those whomight speak and hear. But though the conference had seemed full long tohim, and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation,he inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listenedto without some profit to the speaker."
Mansfield Park,35,"CHAPTER XXXVEdmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chusewhether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentionedbetween them or not; and that if she did not lead the way, it shouldnever be touched on by him; but after a day or two of mutual reserve, hewas induced by his father to change his mind, and try what his influencemight do for his friend.A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords'departure; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make onemore effort for the young man before he left Mansfield, that all hisprofessions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope tosustain them as possible.Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr.Crawford's character in that point. He wished him to be a model ofconstancy; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by nottrying him too long.Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; hewanted to know Fanny's feelings. She had been used to consult him inevery difficulty, and he loved her too well to bear to be denied herconfidence now; he hoped to be of service to her, he thought he must beof service to her; whom else had she to open her heart to? If she didnot need counsel, she must need the comfort of communication. Fannyestranged from him, silent and reserved, was an unnatural state ofthings; a state which he must break through, and which he could easilylearn to think she was wanting him to break through.""I will speak to her, sir: I will take the first opportunity of speakingto her alone,"" was the result of such thoughts as these; and upon SirThomas's information of her being at that very time walking alone in theshrubbery, he instantly joined her.""I am come to walk with you, Fanny,"" said he. ""Shall I?"" Drawing herarm within his. ""It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walktogether.""She assented to it all rather by look than word. Her spirits were low.""But, Fanny,"" he presently added, ""in order to have a comfortable walk,something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together. Youmust talk to me. I know you have something on your mind. I know what youare thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed. Am I to hear of itfrom everybody but Fanny herself?""Fanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, ""If you hear of it fromeverybody, cousin, there can be nothing for me to tell.""""Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny. No one but you can tellme them. I do not mean to press you, however. If it is not what you wishyourself, I have done. I had thought it might be a relief.""""I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief intalking of what I feel.""""Do you suppose that we think differently? I have no idea of it. I daresay that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as muchalike as they have been used to be: to the point--I consider Crawford'sproposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could return hisaffection. I consider it as most natural that all your family shouldwish you could return it; but that, as you cannot, you have done exactlyas you ought in refusing him. Can there be any disagreement between ushere?""""Oh no! But I thought you blamed me. I thought you were against me. Thisis such a comfort!""""This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you sought it. Buthow could you possibly suppose me against you? How could you imagine mean advocate for marriage without love? Were I even careless in generalon such matters, how could you imagine me so where your happiness was atstake?""""My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking to you.""""As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right. I may besorry, I may be surprised--though hardly _that_, for you had not hadtime to attach yourself--but I think you perfectly right. Can it admitof a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love him;nothing could have justified your accepting him.""Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.""So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistakenwho wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here.Crawford's is no common attachment; he perseveres, with the hope ofcreating that regard which had not been created before. This, we know,must be a work of time. But"" (with an affectionate smile) ""let himsucceed at last, Fanny, let him succeed at last. You have provedyourself upright and disinterested, prove yourself grateful andtender-hearted; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman whichI have always believed you born for.""""Oh! never, never, never! he never will succeed with me."" And she spokewith a warmth which quite astonished Edmund, and which she blushed atthe recollection of herself, when she saw his look, and heard himreply, ""Never! Fanny!--so very determined and positive! This is not likeyourself, your rational self.""""I mean,"" she cried, sorrowfully correcting herself, ""that I _think_ Inever shall, as far as the future can be answered for; I think I nevershall return his regard.""""I must hope better things. I am aware, more aware than Crawford can be,that the man who means to make you love him (you having due notice ofhis intentions) must have very uphill work, for there are all your earlyattachments and habits in battle array; and before he can get your heartfor his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon thingsanimate and inanimate, which so many years' growth have confirmed, andwhich are considerably tightened for the moment by the very ideaof separation. I know that the apprehension of being forced to quitMansfield will for a time be arming you against him. I wish he had notbeen obliged to tell you what he was trying for. I wish he had known youas well as I do, Fanny. Between us, I think we should have won you. Mytheoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed.He should have worked upon my plans. I must hope, however, that time,proving him (as I firmly believe it will) to deserve you by his steadyaffection, will give him his reward. I cannot suppose that you have notthe _wish_ to love him--the natural wish of gratitude. You must havesome feeling of that sort. You must be sorry for your own indifference.""""We are so totally unlike,"" said Fanny, avoiding a direct answer, ""weare so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, thatI consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happytogether, even if I _could_ like him. There never were two people moredissimilar. We have not one taste in common. We should be miserable.""""You are mistaken, Fanny. The dissimilarity is not so strong. You arequite enough alike. You _have_ tastes in common. You have moral andliterary tastes in common. You have both warm hearts and benevolentfeelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him read, and saw you listen toShakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions? Youforget yourself: there is a decided difference in your tempers, I allow.He is lively, you are serious; but so much the better: his spirits willsupport yours. It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancydifficulties greater than they are. His cheerfulness will counteractthis. He sees difficulties nowhere: and his pleasantness and gaiety willbe a constant support to you. Your being so far unlike, Fanny, does notin the smallest degree make against the probability of your happinesstogether: do not imagine it. I am myself convinced that it is rather afavourable circumstance. I am perfectly persuaded that the tempershad better be unlike: I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits, inthe manners, in the inclination for much or little company, in thepropensity to talk or to be silent, to be grave or to be gay. Someopposition here is, I am thoroughly convinced, friendly to matrimonialhappiness. I exclude extremes, of course; and a very close resemblancein all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme.A counteraction, gentle and continual, is the best safeguard of mannersand conduct.""Full well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now: Miss Crawford'spower was all returning. He had been speaking of her cheerfully from thehour of his coming home. His avoiding her was quite at an end. He haddined at the Parsonage only the preceding day.After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes, Fanny,feeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford, and said, ""Itis not merely in _temper_ that I consider him as totally unsuited tomyself; though, in _that_ respect, I think the difference between us toogreat, infinitely too great: his spirits often oppress me; but there issomething in him which I object to still more. I must say, cousin, thatI cannot approve his character. I have not thought well of him from thetime of the play. I then saw him behaving, as it appeared to me, sovery improperly and unfeelingly--I may speak of it now because it is allover--so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care how heexposed or hurt him, and paying attentions to my cousin Maria, which--inshort, at the time of the play, I received an impression which willnever be got over.""""My dear Fanny,"" replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her to the end, ""letus not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period ofgeneral folly. The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect.Maria was wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong together; butnone so wrong as myself. Compared with me, all the rest were blameless.I was playing the fool with my eyes open.""""As a bystander,"" said Fanny, ""perhaps I saw more than you did; and I dothink that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous.""""Very possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the wholebusiness. I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable ofit; but, if she could undertake the part, we must not be surprised atthe rest.""""Before the play, I am much mistaken if _Julia_ did not think he waspaying her attentions.""""Julia! I have heard before from some one of his being in love withJulia; but I could never see anything of it. And, Fanny, though I hope Ido justice to my sisters' good qualities, I think it very possible thatthey might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by Crawford,and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectlyprudent. I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society;and with such encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively, and it maybe, a little unthinking, might be led on to--there could be nothing verystriking, because it is clear that he had no pretensions: his heart wasreserved for you. And I must say, that its being for you has raised himinconceivably in my opinion. It does him the highest honour; it shewshis proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pureattachment. It proves him unspoilt by his uncle. It proves him, inshort, everything that I had been used to wish to believe him, andfeared he was not.""""I am persuaded that he does not think, as he ought, on serioussubjects.""""Say, rather, that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects,which I believe to be a good deal the case. How could it be otherwise,with such an education and adviser? Under the disadvantages, indeed,which both have had, is it not wonderful that they should be what theyare? Crawford's _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hithertobeen too much his guides. Happily, those feelings have generally beengood. You will supply the rest; and a most fortunate man he is to attachhimself to such a creature--to a woman who, firm as a rock in her ownprinciples, has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommendthem. He has chosen his partner, indeed, with rare felicity. He willmake you happy, Fanny; I know he will make you happy; but you will makehim everything.""""I would not engage in such a charge,"" cried Fanny, in a shrinkingaccent; ""in such an office of high responsibility!""""As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything! fancying everythingtoo much for you! Well, though I may not be able to persuade you intodifferent feelings, you will be persuaded into them, I trust. I confessmyself sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common interest inCrawford's well-doing. Next to your happiness, Fanny, his has the firstclaim on me. You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford.""Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say; and they walkedon together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction. Edmundfirst began again--""I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday,particularly pleased, because I had not depended upon her seeingeverything in so just a light. I knew she was very fond of you; but yetI was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite asit deserved, and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed onsome woman of distinction or fortune. I was afraid of the bias of thoseworldly maxims, which she has been too much used to hear. But it wasvery different. She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought. She desiresthe connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talkabout it. I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxiousto know her sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutesbefore she began introducing it with all that openness of heart, andsweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are somuch a part of herself. Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity.""""Was Mrs. Grant in the room, then?""""Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together bythemselves; and when once we had begun, we had not done with you, Fanny,till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in.""""It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford.""""Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her,however, before she goes. She is very angry with you, Fanny; you must beprepared for that. She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine heranger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks herbrother has a right to everything he may wish for, at the first moment.She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and esteems youwith all her heart.""""I knew she would be very angry with me.""""My dearest Fanny,"" cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, ""donot let the idea of her anger distress you. It is anger to be talkedof rather than felt. Her heart is made for love and kindness, not forresentment. I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise;I wish you could have seen her countenance, when she said that you_should_ be Henry's wife. And I observed that she always spoke of youas 'Fanny,' which she was never used to do; and it had a sound of mostsisterly cordiality.""""And Mrs. Grant, did she say--did she speak; was she there all thetime?""""Yes, she was agreeing exactly with her sister. The surprise of yourrefusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded. That you could refuse sucha man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand. I said whatI could for you; but in good truth, as they stated the case--you mustprove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a differentconduct; nothing else will satisfy them. But this is teasing you. I havedone. Do not turn away from me.""""I _should_ have thought,"" said Fanny, after a pause of recollection andexertion, ""that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man'snot being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at least, lethim be ever so generally agreeable. Let him have all the perfectionsin the world, I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a manmust be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself. But,even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claimswhich his sisters think he has, how was I to be prepared to meet himwith any feeling answerable to his own? He took me wholly by surprise.I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning; andsurely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he wastaking what seemed very idle notice of me. In my situation, it wouldhave been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr.Crawford. I am sure his sisters, rating him as they do, must havethought it so, supposing he had meant nothing. How, then, was I tobe--to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me? How was Ito have an attachment at his service, as soon as it was asked for? Hissisters should consider me as well as him. The higher his deserts, themore improper for me ever to have thought of him. And, and--we thinkvery differently of the nature of women, if they can imagine a woman sovery soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply.""""My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth. I know this to be the truth;and most worthy of you are such feelings. I had attributed them to youbefore. I thought I could understand you. You have now given exactlythe explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs.Grant, and they were both better satisfied, though your warm-heartedfriend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of herfondness for Henry. I told them that you were of all human creatures theone over whom habit had most power and novelty least; and that the verycircumstance of the novelty of Crawford's addresses was against him.Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour; that youcould tolerate nothing that you were not used to; and a great deal moreto the same purpose, to give them a knowledge of your character. MissCrawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother.She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time,and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about tenyears' happy marriage.""Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for. Herfeelings were all in revolt. She feared she had been doing wrong: sayingtoo much, overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary;in guarding against one evil, laying herself open to another; and tohave Miss Crawford's liveliness repeated to her at such a moment, and onsuch a subject, was a bitter aggravation.Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face, and immediately resolvedto forbear all farther discussion; and not even to mention the nameof Crawford again, except as it might be connected with what _must_ beagreeable to her. On this principle, he soon afterwards observed--""Theygo on Monday. You are sure, therefore, of seeing your friend eitherto-morrow or Sunday. They really go on Monday; and I was within a trifleof being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day! I had almostpromised it. What a difference it might have made! Those five or sixdays more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life.""""You were near staying there?""""Very. I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented. Had Ireceived any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you were all goingon, I believe I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing thathad happened here for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away longenough.""""You spent your time pleasantly there?""""Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not. They wereall very pleasant. I doubt their finding me so. I took uneasiness withme, and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again.""""The Miss Owens--you liked them, did not you?""""Yes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I amspoilt, Fanny, for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffectedgirls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. Theyare two distinct orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made me toonice.""Still, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied; he saw it in her looks,it could not be talked away; and attempting it no more, he led herdirectly, with the kind authority of a privileged guardian, into thehouse."
Mansfield Park,36,"CHAPTER XXXVIEdmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fannycould tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments, and hewas satisfied. It had been, as he before presumed, too hasty a measureon Crawford's side, and time must be given to make the idea firstfamiliar, and then agreeable to her. She must be used to theconsideration of his being in love with her, and then a return ofaffection might not be very distant.He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father;and recommended there being nothing more said to her: no fartherattempts to influence or persuade; but that everything should be left toCrawford's assiduities, and the natural workings of her own mind.Sir Thomas promised that it should be so. Edmund's account of Fanny'sdisposition he could believe to be just; he supposed she had all thosefeelings, but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _had_;for, less willing than his son to trust to the future, he could nothelp fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit werenecessary for her, she might not have persuaded herself into receivinghis addresses properly before the young man's inclination for payingthem were over. There was nothing to be done, however, but to submitquietly and hope the best.The promised visit from ""her friend,"" as Edmund called Miss Crawford,was a formidable threat to Fanny, and she lived in continual terror ofit. As a sister, so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous ofwhat she said, and in another light so triumphant and secure, she was inevery way an object of painful alarm. Her displeasure, her penetration,and her happiness were all fearful to encounter; and the dependence ofhaving others present when they met was Fanny's only support in lookingforward to it. She absented herself as little as possible from LadyBertram, kept away from the East room, and took no solitary walk in theshrubbery, in her caution to avoid any sudden attack.She succeeded. She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt, whenMiss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawfordlooking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than shehad anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse to beendured than a half-hour of moderate agitation. But here she hoped toomuch; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity. She was determinedto see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her tolerably soon, in a lowvoice, ""I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere""; words thatFanny felt all over her, in all her pulses and all her nerves. Denialwas impossible. Her habits of ready submission, on the contrary, madeher almost instantly rise and lead the way out of the room. She did itwith wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance wasover on Miss Crawford's side. She immediately shook her head at Fannywith arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand, seemed hardlyable to help beginning directly. She said nothing, however, but, ""Sad,sad girl! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,"" and haddiscretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure ofhaving four walls to themselves. Fanny naturally turned upstairs, andtook her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortableuse; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart, and feelingthat she had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot hadyet witnessed. But the evil ready to burst on her was at least delayedby the sudden change in Miss Crawford's ideas; by the strong effect onher mind which the finding herself in the East room again produced.""Ha!"" she cried, with instant animation, ""am I here again? The Eastroom! Once only was I in this room before""; and after stopping to lookabout her, and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed, she added,""Once only before. Do you remember it? I came to rehearse. Your cousincame too; and we had a rehearsal. You were our audience and prompter.A delightful rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we were, just inthis part of the room: here was your cousin, here was I, here were thechairs. Oh! why will such things ever pass away?""Happily for her companion, she wanted no answer. Her mind was entirelyself-engrossed. She was in a reverie of sweet remembrances.""The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable! The subject ofit so very--very--what shall I say? He was to be describing andrecommending matrimony to me. I think I see him now, trying to be asdemure and composed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches.'When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimonymay be called a happy life.' I suppose no time can ever wear out theimpression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words. It wascurious, very curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If Ihad the power of recalling any one week of my existence, it should bethat week--that acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be_that_; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. Hissturdy spirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. Butalas, that very evening destroyed it all. That very evening brought yourmost unwelcome uncle. Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you? Yet,Fanny, do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas,though I certainly did hate him for many a week. No, I do him justicenow. He is just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sobersadness, I believe I now love you all."" And having said so, with adegree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in herbefore, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a momentto recover herself. ""I have had a little fit since I came into thisroom, as you may perceive,"" said she presently, with a playful smile,""but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as toscolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have notthe heart for it when it comes to the point."" And embracing her veryaffectionately, ""Good, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being thelast time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quiteimpossible to do anything but love you.""Fanny was affected. She had not foreseen anything of this, and herfeelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word""last."" She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than shepossibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight ofsuch emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said, ""I hate to leaveyou. I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says weshall not be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born tobe connected; and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dearFanny.""Fanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said, ""But you areonly going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a veryparticular friend.""""Yes, very true. Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years. ButI have not the least inclination to go near her. I can think only of thefriends I am leaving: my excellent sister, yourself, and the Bertrams ingeneral. You have all so much more _heart_ among you than one finds inthe world at large. You all give me a feeling of being able to trust andconfide in you, which in common intercourse one knows nothing of. I wishI had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter, amuch better time for the visit, but now I cannot put her off. And whenI have done with her I must go to her sister, Lady Stornaway, because_she_ was rather my most particular friend of the two, but I have notcared much for _her_ these three years.""After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent, eachthoughtful: Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in theworld, Mary on something of less philosophic tendency. _She_ first spokeagain.""How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs, andsetting off to find my way to the East room, without having an ideawhereabouts it was! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I camealong, and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table atwork; and then your cousin's astonishment, when he opened the door, atseeing me here! To be sure, your uncle's returning that very evening!There never was anything quite like it.""Another short fit of abstraction followed, when, shaking it off, shethus attacked her companion.""Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of onewho is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for ashort time into our circle in town, that you might understand how yourpower over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and heartburningsof dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that will be felt athearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the heroof an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should come to Londonto know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to see how he iscourted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am well aware thatI shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of hissituation with you. When she comes to know the truth she will, verylikely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is a daughter ofMr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get married, andwants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to such a degree.Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an idea of the_sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity there willbe to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to answer! PoorMargaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth,and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish Margaret weremarried, for my poor friend's sake, for I look upon the Frasers to beabout as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it was a mostdesirable match for Janet at the time. We were all delighted. She couldnot do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich, and she had nothing;but he turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and wants a young woman,a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be as steady as himself.And my friend does not manage him well; she does not seem to know howto make the best of it. There is a spirit of irritation which, to saynothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In their house I shall callto mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect. EvenDr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister, and a certainconsideration for her judgment, which makes one feel there _is_attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers. I shallbe at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as a wife, Sir ThomasBertram as a husband, are my standards of perfection. Poor Janet hasbeen sadly taken in, and yet there was nothing improper on her side:she did not run into the match inconsiderately; there was no want offoresight. She took three days to consider of his proposals, and duringthose three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whoseopinion was worth having, and especially applied to my late dear aunt,whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally anddeservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance, andshe was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing werea security for matrimonial comfort. I have not so much to say for myfriend Flora, who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sakeof that horrid Lord Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, asMr. Rushworth, but much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character.I _had_ my doubts at the time about her being right, for he has not eventhe air of a gentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye,Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were Ito attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in lovewith him, I should never have done. It is you, only you, insensibleFanny, who can think of him with anything like indifference. But are youso insensible as you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not.""There was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny's face at that moment asmight warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind.""Excellent creature! I will not tease you. Everything shall take itscourse. But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutelyunprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is notpossible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject, somesurmises as to what might be. You must have seen that he was trying toplease you by every attention in his power. Was not he devoted to youat the ball? And then before the ball, the necklace! Oh! you receivedit just as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart could desire. Iremember it perfectly.""""Do you mean, then, that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand?Oh! Miss Crawford, _that_ was not fair.""""Knew of it! It was his own doing entirely, his own thought. I amashamed to say that it had never entered my head, but I was delighted toact on his proposal for both your sakes.""""I will not say,"" replied Fanny, ""that I was not half afraid at the timeof its being so, for there was something in your look that frightenedme, but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at first--indeed,indeed I was. It is as true as that I sit here. And had I had an ideaof it, nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace. As to yourbrother's behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a particularity: I hadbeen sensible of it some little time, perhaps two or three weeks; butthen I considered it as meaning nothing: I put it down as simply beinghis way, and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have anyserious thoughts of me. I had not, Miss Crawford, been an inattentiveobserver of what was passing between him and some part of this family inthe summer and autumn. I was quiet, but I was not blind. I could notbut see that Mr. Crawford allowed himself in gallantries which did meannothing.""""Ah! I cannot deny it. He has now and then been a sad flirt, andcared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies'affections. I have often scolded him for it, but it is his only fault;and there is this to be said, that very few young ladies have anyaffections worth caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing onewho has been shot at by so many; of having it in one's power to pay offthe debts of one's sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman's nature torefuse such a triumph.""Fanny shook her head. ""I cannot think well of a man who sports with anywoman's feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered thana stander-by can judge of.""""I do not defend him. I leave him entirely to your mercy, and when hehas got you at Everingham, I do not care how much you lecture him. Butthis I will say, that his fault, the liking to make girls a littlein love with him, is not half so dangerous to a wife's happiness as atendency to fall in love himself, which he has never been addicted to.And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a waythat he never was to any woman before; that he loves you with all hisheart, and will love you as nearly for ever as possible. If any man everloved a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you.""Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say.""I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,"" continued Marypresently, ""than when he had succeeded in getting your brother'scommission.""She had made a sure push at Fanny's feelings here.""Oh! yes. How very, very kind of him.""""I know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know the partieshe had to move. The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours;and there are so many young men's claims to be attended to in the sameway, that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is easily putby. What a happy creature William must be! I wish we could see him.""Poor Fanny's mind was thrown into the most distressing of all itsvarieties. The recollection of what had been done for William was alwaysthe most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford; andshe sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been first watchingher complacently, and then musing on something else, suddenly calledher attention by saying: ""I should like to sit talking with you here allday, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so good-bye, my dear,my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall nominally part inthe breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here. And I do takeleave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meetagain, it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to eachother without any remnant or shadow of reserve.""A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompaniedthese words.""I shall see your cousin in town soon: he talks of being there tolerablysoon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the course of the spring; and youreldest cousin, and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am sure of meeting againand again, and all but you. I have two favours to ask, Fanny: one isyour correspondence. You must write to me. And the other, that you willoften call on Mrs. Grant, and make her amends for my being gone.""The first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather not have beenasked; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence; itwas impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily thanher own judgment authorised. There was no resisting so much apparentaffection. Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fondtreatment, and from having hitherto known so little of it, she was themore overcome by Miss Crawford's. Besides, there was gratitude towardsher, for having made their _tete-a-tete_ so much less painful than herfears had predicted.It was over, and she had escaped without reproaches and withoutdetection. Her secret was still her own; and while that was the case,she thought she could resign herself to almost everything.In the evening there was another parting. Henry Crawford came andsat some time with them; and her spirits not being previously in thestrongest state, her heart was softened for a while towards him, becausehe really seemed to feel. Quite unlike his usual self, he scarcely saidanything. He was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must grieve for him,though hoping she might never see him again till he were the husband ofsome other woman.When it came to the moment of parting, he would take her hand, he wouldnot be denied it; he said nothing, however, or nothing that she heard,and when he had left the room, she was better pleased that such a tokenof friendship had passed.On the morrow the Crawfords were gone."
Mansfield Park,37,"CHAPTER XXXVIIMr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas's next object was that he should bemissed; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blankin the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt, orfancied, an evil. She had tasted of consequence in its most flatteringform; and he did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again intonothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind. He watched herwith this idea; but he could hardly tell with what success. He hardlyknew whether there were any difference in her spirits or not. Shewas always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond hisdiscrimination. He did not understand her: he felt that he did not; andtherefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on thepresent occasion, and whether she were more or less happy than she hadbeen.Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his fathera little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days couldproduce any.What chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford's sister, the friendand companion who had been so much to her, should not be more visiblyregretted. He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _her_, and had solittle voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation.Alas! it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now thechief bane of Fanny's comfort. If she could have believed Mary's futurefate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother'sshould be, if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distantas she was much inclined to think his, she would have been light ofheart indeed; but the more she recollected and observed, the more deeplywas she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for MissCrawford's marrying Edmund than it had ever been before. On his side theinclination was stronger, on hers less equivocal. His objections, thescruples of his integrity, seemed all done away, nobody could tellhow; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were equally gotover--and equally without apparent reason. It could only be imputed toincreasing attachment. His good and her bad feelings yielded to love,and such love must unite them. He was to go to town as soon as somebusiness relative to Thornton Lacey were completed--perhaps within afortnight; he talked of going, he loved to talk of it; and when oncewith her again, Fanny could not doubt the rest. Her acceptance must beas certain as his offer; and yet there were bad feelings still remainingwhich made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her, independently, shebelieved, independently of self.In their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some amiablesensations, and much personal kindness, had still been Miss Crawford;still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered, and without any suspicionof being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light. She might love, butshe did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment. Fanny believed therewas scarcely a second feeling in common between them; and she may beforgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford'sfuture improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking that if Edmund'sinfluence in this season of love had already done so little in clearingher judgment, and regulating her notions, his worth would be finallywasted on her even in years of matrimony.Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced,and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford's nature thatparticipation of the general nature of women which would lead her toadopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own. Butas such were Fanny's persuasions, she suffered very much from them, andcould never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his own hopes and his ownobservations, still feeling a right, by all his knowledge of humannature, to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequenceon his niece's spirits, and the past attentions of the lover producing acraving for their return; and he was soon afterwards able to account forhis not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this, by the prospectof another visitor, whose approach he could allow to be quite enough tosupport the spirits he was watching. William had obtained a ten days'leave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire, and was coming, thehappiest of lieutenants, because the latest made, to shew his happinessand describe his uniform.He came; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform there too,had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty. So theuniform remained at Portsmouth, and Edmund conjectured that before Fannyhad any chance of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the freshnessof its wearer's feelings must be worn away. It would be sunk into abadge of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming, or more worthless,than the uniform of a lieutenant, who has been a lieutenant a year ortwo, and sees others made commanders before him? So reasoned Edmund,till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny'schance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his gloryin another light.This scheme was that she should accompany her brother back toPortsmouth, and spend a little time with her own family. It had occurredto Sir Thomas, in one of his dignified musings, as a right and desirablemeasure; but before he absolutely made up his mind, he consulted hisson. Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing but what was right.The thing was good in itself, and could not be done at a better time;and he had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to Fanny. This wasenough to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive ""then so it shall be""closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring from it with somefeelings of satisfaction, and views of good over and above what he hadcommunicated to his son; for his prime motive in sending her away hadvery little to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again,and nothing at all with any idea of making her happy. He certainlywished her to go willingly, but he as certainly wished her to beheartily sick of home before her visit ended; and that a littleabstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park wouldbring her mind into a sober state, and incline her to a juster estimateof the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal comfort, ofwhich she had the offer.It was a medicinal project upon his niece's understanding, which he mustconsider as at present diseased. A residence of eight or nine years inthe abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her powers ofcomparing and judging. Her father's house would, in all probability,teach her the value of a good income; and he trusted that she would bethe wiser and happier woman, all her life, for the experiment he haddevised.Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have had a strongattack of them when she first understood what was intended, when heruncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,and sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; ofreturning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, withWilliam for the protector and companion of her journey, and thecertainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his remainingon land. Had she ever given way to bursts of delight, it must have beenthen, for she was delighted, but her happiness was of a quiet, deep,heart-swelling sort; and though never a great talker, she was alwaysmore inclined to silence when feeling most strongly. At the moment shecould only thank and accept. Afterwards, when familiarised with thevisions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more largelyto William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were emotionsof tenderness that could not be clothed in words. The remembrance of allher earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered in being torn fromthem, came over her with renewed strength, and it seemed as if to beat home again would heal every pain that had since grown out of theseparation. To be in the centre of such a circle, loved by so many,and more loved by all than she had ever been before; to feel affectionwithout fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal of those whosurrounded her; to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords, safefrom every look which could be fancied a reproach on their account. Thiswas a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that could be but halfacknowledged.Edmund, too--to be two months from _him_ (and perhaps she might beallowed to make her absence three) must do her good. At a distance,unassailed by his looks or his kindness, and safe from the perpetualirritation of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence,she should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she shouldbe able to think of him as in London, and arranging everything there,without wretchedness. What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield wasto become a slight evil at Portsmouth.The only drawback was the doubt of her aunt Bertram's being comfortablewithout her. She was of use to no one else; but _there_ she might bemissed to a degree that she did not like to think of; and that part ofthe arrangement was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish,and what only _he_ could have accomplished at all.But he was master at Mansfield Park. When he had really resolved onany measure, he could always carry it through; and now by dint of longtalking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny'ssometimes seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go;obtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction, for LadyBertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thoughtFanny ought to go, and therefore that she must. In the calmness ofher own dressing-room, in the impartial flow of her own meditations,unbiassed by his bewildering statements, she could not acknowledge anynecessity for Fanny's ever going near a father and mother who had donewithout her so long, while she was so useful to herself. And as to thenot missing her, which under Mrs. Norris's discussion was the pointattempted to be proved, she set herself very steadily against admittingany such thing.Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason, conscience, and dignity. Hecalled it a sacrifice, and demanded it of her goodness and self-commandas such. But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be verywell spared--_she_ being ready to give up all her own time to her asrequested--and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.""That may be, sister,"" was all Lady Bertram's reply. ""I dare say you arevery right; but I am sure I shall miss her very much.""The next step was to communicate with Portsmouth. Fanny wrote to offerherself; and her mother's answer, though short, was so kind--a fewsimple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospectof seeing her child again, as to confirm all the daughter's views ofhappiness in being with her--convincing her that she should now find awarm and affectionate friend in the ""mama"" who had certainly shewn noremarkable fondness for her formerly; but this she could easily supposeto have been her own fault or her own fancy. She had probably alienatedlove by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper, or beenunreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many coulddeserve. Now, when she knew better how to be useful, and how to forbear,and when her mother could be no longer occupied by the incessantdemands of a house full of little children, there would be leisure andinclination for every comfort, and they should soon be what mother anddaughter ought to be to each other.William was almost as happy in the plan as his sister. It would be thegreatest pleasure to him to have her there to the last moment before hesailed, and perhaps find her there still when he came in from his firstcruise. And besides, he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush beforeshe went out of harbour--the Thrush was certainly the finest sloop inthe service--and there were several improvements in the dockyard, too,which he quite longed to shew her.He did not scruple to add that her being at home for a while would be agreat advantage to everybody.""I do not know how it is,"" said he; ""but we seem to want some ofyour nice ways and orderliness at my father's. The house is always inconfusion. You will set things going in a better way, I am sure. Youwill tell my mother how it all ought to be, and you will be so useful toSusan, and you will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind you.How right and comfortable it will all be!""By the time Mrs. Price's answer arrived, there remained but a very fewdays more to be spent at Mansfield; and for part of one of those daysthe young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject oftheir journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs.Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother-in-law's moneywas vain, and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensiveconveyance of Fanny, they were to travel post; when she saw Sir Thomasactually give William notes for the purpose, she was struck with theidea of there being room for a third in the carriage, and suddenlyseized with a strong inclination to go with them, to go and see her poordear sister Price. She proclaimed her thoughts. She must say that shehad more than half a mind to go with the young people; it would be suchan indulgence to her; she had not seen her poor dear sister Price formore than twenty years; and it would be a help to the young people intheir journey to have her older head to manage for them; and she couldnot help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkindof her not to come by such an opportunity.William and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.All the comfort of their comfortable journey would be destroyed atonce. With woeful countenances they looked at each other. Their suspenselasted an hour or two. No one interfered to encourage or dissuade. Mrs.Norris was left to settle the matter by herself; and it ended, to theinfinite joy of her nephew and niece, in the recollection that she couldnot possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present; that she was agreat deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her tobe able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week, andtherefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of beinguseful to them.It had, in fact, occurred to her, that though taken to Portsmouth fornothing, it would be hardly possible for her to avoid paying her ownexpenses back again. So her poor dear sister Price was left to all thedisappointment of her missing such an opportunity, and another twentyyears' absence, perhaps, begun.Edmund's plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey, this absence ofFanny's. He too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as hisaunt. He had intended, about this time, to be going to London; but hecould not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of mostimportance to their comfort was leaving them; and with an effort, feltbut not boasted of, he delayed for a week or two longer a journey whichhe was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness forever.He told Fanny of it. She knew so much already, that she must knoweverything. It made the substance of one other confidential discourseabout Miss Crawford; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it tobe the last time in which Miss Crawford's name would ever be mentionedbetween them with any remains of liberty. Once afterwards she wasalluded to by him. Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in theevening to write to her soon and often, and promising to be a goodcorrespondent herself; and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then addedin a whisper, ""And _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anythingworth writing about, anything to say that I think you will like to hear,and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter."" Had shedoubted his meaning while she listened, the glow in his face, when shelooked up at him, would have been decisive.For this letter she must try to arm herself. That a letter from Edmundshould be a subject of terror! She began to feel that she had not yetgone through all the changes of opinion and sentiment which the progressof time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world ofchanges. The vicissitudes of the human mind had not yet been exhaustedby her.Poor Fanny! though going as she did willingly and eagerly, the lastevening at Mansfield Park must still be wretchedness. Her heart wascompletely sad at parting. She had tears for every room in the house,much more for every beloved inhabitant. She clung to her aunt, becauseshe would miss her; she kissed the hand of her uncle with strugglingsobs, because she had displeased him; and as for Edmund, she couldneither speak, nor look, nor think, when the last moment came with_him_; and it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving herthe affectionate farewell of a brother.All this passed overnight, for the journey was to begin very early inthe morning; and when the small, diminished party met at breakfast,William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage."
Mansfield Park,38,"CHAPTER XXXVIIIThe novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William, soonproduced their natural effect on Fanny's spirits, when Mansfield Parkwas fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was ended, andthey were to quit Sir Thomas's carriage, she was able to take leave ofthe old coachman, and send back proper messages, with cheerful looks.Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end.Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William's mind, andhe was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher-tonedsubjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in praise of theThrush, conjectures how she would be employed, schemes for an actionwith some superior force, which (supposing the first lieutenant out ofthe way, and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant) wasto give himself the next step as soon as possible, or speculations uponprize-money, which was to be generously distributed at home, with onlythe reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable,in which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later lifetogether.Fanny's immediate concerns, as far as they involved Mr. Crawford, madeno part of their conversation. William knew what had passed, and fromhis heart lamented that his sister's feelings should be so cold towardsa man whom he must consider as the first of human characters; but he wasof an age to be all for love, and therefore unable to blame; and knowingher wish on the subject, he would not distress her by the slightestallusion.She had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford. Shehad heard repeatedly from his sister within the three weeks which hadpassed since their leaving Mansfield, and in each letter there had beena few lines from himself, warm and determined like his speeches. Itwas a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she hadfeared. Miss Crawford's style of writing, lively and affectionate, wasitself an evil, independent of what she was thus forced into readingfrom the brother's pen, for Edmund would never rest till she had readthe chief of the letter to him; and then she had to listen to hisadmiration of her language, and the warmth of her attachments. Therehad, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion, of recollection, somuch of Mansfield in every letter, that Fanny could not but suppose itmeant for him to hear; and to find herself forced into a purpose ofthat kind, compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her theaddresses of the man she did not love, and obliging her to administerto the adverse passion of the man she did, was cruelly mortifying. Here,too, her present removal promised advantage. When no longer under thesame roof with Edmund, she trusted that Miss Crawford would have nomotive for writing strong enough to overcome the trouble, and that atPortsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into nothing.With such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others, Fanny proceededin her journey safely and cheerfully, and as expeditiously as couldrationally be hoped in the dirty month of February. They entered Oxford,but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund's college as theypassed along, and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury, wherea comfortable meal, uniting dinner and supper, wound up the enjoymentsand fatigues of the day.The next morning saw them off again at an early hour; and with noevents, and no delays, they regularly advanced, and were in the environsof Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look around her,and wonder at the new buildings. They passed the drawbridge, andentered the town; and the light was only beginning to fail as, guidedby William's powerful voice, they were rattled into a narrow street,leading from the High Street, and drawn up before the door of a smallhouse now inhabited by Mr. Price.Fanny was all agitation and flutter; all hope and apprehension. Themoment they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant, seemingly inwaiting for them at the door, stepped forward, and more intent ontelling the news than giving them any help, immediately began with, ""TheThrush is gone out of harbour, please sir, and one of the officers hasbeen here to--"" She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven yearsold, who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside, and whileWilliam was opening the chaise-door himself, called out, ""You are justin time. We have been looking for you this half-hour. The Thrush wentout of harbour this morning. I saw her. It was a beautiful sight. Andthey think she will have her orders in a day or two. And Mr. Campbellwas here at four o'clock to ask for you: he has got one of the Thrush'sboats, and is going off to her at six, and hoped you would be here intime to go with him.""A stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of the carriage, wasall the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he made noobjection to her kissing him, though still entirely engaged in detailingfarther particulars of the Thrush's going out of harbour, in whichhe had a strong right of interest, being to commence his career ofseamanship in her at this very time.Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of thehouse, and in her mother's arms, who met her there with looks of truekindness, and with features which Fanny loved the more, because theybrought her aunt Bertram's before her, and there were her two sisters:Susan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest ofthe family, about five--both glad to see her in their way, though withno advantage of manner in receiving her. But manner Fanny did not want.Would they but love her, she should be satisfied.She was then taken into a parlour, so small that her first convictionwas of its being only a passage-room to something better, and she stoodfor a moment expecting to be invited on; but when she saw there wasno other door, and that there were signs of habitation before her, shecalled back her thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved lest they shouldhave been suspected. Her mother, however, could not stay long enoughto suspect anything. She was gone again to the street-door, to welcomeWilliam. ""Oh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But have youheard about the Thrush? She is gone out of harbour already; three daysbefore we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do aboutSam's things, they will never be ready in time; for she may have herorders to-morrow, perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now you mustbe off for Spithead too. Campbell has been here, quite in a worry aboutyou; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a comfortableevening with you, and here everything comes upon me at once.""Her son answered cheerfully, telling her that everything was always forthe best; and making light of his own inconvenience in being obliged tohurry away so soon.""To be sure, I had much rather she had stayed in harbour, that I mighthave sat a few hours with you in comfort; but as there is a boat ashore,I had better go off at once, and there is no help for it. Whereaboutsdoes the Thrush lay at Spithead? Near the Canopus? But no matter; here'sFanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in the passage? Come,mother, you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet.""In they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her daughteragain, and commented a little on her growth, began with very naturalsolicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers.""Poor dears! how tired you must both be! and now, what will you have? Ibegan to think you would never come. Betsey and I have been watching foryou this half-hour. And when did you get anything to eat? And what wouldyou like to have now? I could not tell whether you would be for somemeat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would havegot something ready. And now I am afraid Campbell will be here beforethere is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand. It isvery inconvenient to have no butcher in the street. We were better offin our last house. Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can begot.""They both declared they should prefer it to anything. ""Then, Betsey, mydear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on; andtell her to bring in the tea-things as soon as she can. I wish we couldget the bell mended; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger.""Betsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her abilities before her finenew sister.""Dear me!"" continued the anxious mother, ""what a sad fire we have got,and I dare say you are both starved with cold. Draw your chair nearer,my dear. I cannot think what Rebecca has been about. I am sure I toldher to bring some coals half an hour ago. Susan, you should have takencare of the fire.""""I was upstairs, mama, moving my things,"" said Susan, in a fearless,self-defending tone, which startled Fanny. ""You know you had but justsettled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room; and Icould not get Rebecca to give me any help.""Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles: first, the drivercame to be paid; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca aboutthe manner of carrying up his sister's trunk, which he would manage allhis own way; and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his own loud voicepreceding him, as with something of the oath kind he kicked away hisson's port-manteau and his daughter's bandbox in the passage, and calledout for a candle; no candle was brought, however, and he walked into theroom.Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him, but sank down againon finding herself undistinguished in the dusk, and unthought of. Witha friendly shake of his son's hand, and an eager voice, he instantlybegan--""Ha! welcome back, my boy. Glad to see you. Have you heard thenews? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning. Sharp is theword, you see! By G--, you are just in time! The doctor has been hereinquiring for you: he has got one of the boats, and is to be off forSpithead by six, so you had better go with him. I have been to Turner'sabout your mess; it is all in a way to be done. I should not wonder ifyou had your orders to-morrow: but you cannot sail with this wind, ifyou are to cruise to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you willcertainly have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant. By G--, Iwish you may! But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he thought youwould be sent first to the Texel. Well, well, we are ready, whateverhappens. But by G--, you lost a fine sight by not being here in themorning to see the Thrush go out of harbour! I would not have been outof the way for a thousand pounds. Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time,to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out, I jumped up, andmade but two steps to the platform. If ever there was a perfect beautyafloat, she is one; and there she lays at Spithead, and anybody inEngland would take her for an eight-and-twenty. I was upon the platformtwo hours this afternoon looking at her. She lays close to the Endymion,between her and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the sheer hulk.""""Ha!"" cried William, ""_that's_ just where I should have put her myself.It's the best berth at Spithead. But here is my sister, sir; here isFanny,"" turning and leading her forward; ""it is so dark you do not seeher.""With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her, Mr. Price nowreceived his daughter; and having given her a cordial hug, and observedthat she was grown into a woman, and he supposed would be wanting ahusband soon, seemed very much inclined to forget her again. Fannyshrunk back to her seat, with feelings sadly pained by his language andhis smell of spirits; and he talked on only to his son, and only of theThrush, though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject,more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny, and her longabsence and long journey.After sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained; but as there wasstill no appearance of tea, nor, from Betsey's reports from the kitchen,much hope of any under a considerable period, William determined togo and change his dress, and make the necessary preparations forhis removal on board directly, that he might have his tea in comfortafterwards.As he left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty, about eightand nine years old, rushed into it just released from school, and comingeagerly to see their sister, and tell that the Thrush was gone out ofharbour; Tom and Charles. Charles had been born since Fanny's goingaway, but Tom she had often helped to nurse, and now felt a particularpleasure in seeing again. Both were kissed very tenderly, but Tom shewanted to keep by her, to try to trace the features of the baby she hadloved, and talked to, of his infant preference of herself. Tom, however,had no mind for such treatment: he came home not to stand and be talkedto, but to run about and make a noise; and both boys had soon burst fromher, and slammed the parlour-door till her temples ached.She had now seen all that were at home; there remained only two brothersbetween herself and Susan, one of whom was a clerk in a public officein London, and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman. But though shehad _seen_ all the members of the family, she had not yet _heard_ allthe noise they could make. Another quarter of an hour brought her agreat deal more. William was soon calling out from the landing-place ofthe second story for his mother and for Rebecca. He was in distressfor something that he had left there, and did not find again. A key wasmislaid, Betsey accused of having got at his new hat, and some slight,but essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat, which he had beenpromised to have done for him, entirely neglected.Mrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves, alltalking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job was to be done aswell as it could in a great hurry; William trying in vain to send Betseydown again, or keep her from being troublesome where she was; the wholeof which, as almost every door in the house was open, could be plainlydistinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at intervals by thesuperior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing each other up and downstairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.Fanny was almost stunned. The smallness of the house and thinness of thewalls brought everything so close to her, that, added to the fatigue ofher journey, and all her recent agitation, she hardly knew how tobear it. _Within_ the room all was tranquil enough, for Susan havingdisappeared with the others, there were soon only her father and herselfremaining; and he, taking out a newspaper, the accustomary loan of aneighbour, applied himself to studying it, without seeming to recollecther existence. The solitary candle was held between himself and thepaper, without any reference to her possible convenience; but she hadnothing to do, and was glad to have the light screened from her achinghead, as she sat in bewildered, broken, sorrowful contemplation.She was at home. But, alas! it was not such a home, she had not such awelcome, as--she checked herself; she was unreasonable. What right hadshe to be of importance to her family? She could have none, so long lostsight of! William's concerns must be dearest, they always had been, andhe had every right. Yet to have so little said or asked about herself,to have scarcely an inquiry made after Mansfield! It did pain her tohave Mansfield forgotten; the friends who had done so much--the dear,dear friends! But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest. Perhapsit must be so. The destination of the Thrush must be now preeminentlyinteresting. A day or two might shew the difference. _She_ only was toblame. Yet she thought it would not have been so at Mansfield. No, inher uncle's house there would have been a consideration of times andseasons, a regulation of subject, a propriety, an attention towardseverybody which there was not here.The only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly halfan hour was from a sudden burst of her father's, not at all calculatedto compose them. At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooingin the passage, he exclaimed, ""Devil take those young dogs! How they aresinging out! Ay, Sam's voice louder than all the rest! That boy is fitfor a boatswain. Holla, you there! Sam, stop your confounded pipe, or Ishall be after you.""This threat was so palpably disregarded, that though within five minutesafterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down,Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than theirbeing for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces and pantingbreaths seemed to prove, especially as they were still kicking eachother's shins, and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately undertheir father's eye.The next opening of the door brought something more welcome: it was forthe tea-things, which she had begun almost to despair of seeing thatevening. Susan and an attendant girl, whose inferior appearance informedFanny, to her great surprise, that she had previously seen the upperservant, brought in everything necessary for the meal; Susan looking, asshe put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister, as if dividedbetween the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and usefulness,and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office. ""Shehad been into the kitchen,"" she said, ""to hurry Sally and help make thetoast, and spread the bread and butter, or she did not know when theyshould have got tea, and she was sure her sister must want somethingafter her journey.""Fanny was very thankful. She could not but own that she should be veryglad of a little tea, and Susan immediately set about making it, as ifpleased to have the employment all to herself; and with only a littleunnecessary bustle, and some few injudicious attempts at keeping herbrothers in better order than she could, acquitted herself very well.Fanny's spirit was as much refreshed as her body; her head and heartwere soon the better for such well-timed kindness. Susan had an open,sensible countenance; she was like William, and Fanny hoped to find herlike him in disposition and goodwill towards herself.In this more placid state of things William reentered, followed notfar behind by his mother and Betsey. He, complete in his lieutenant'suniform, looking and moving all the taller, firmer, and more gracefulfor it, and with the happiest smile over his face, walked up directlyto Fanny, who, rising from her seat, looked at him for a moment inspeechless admiration, and then threw her arms round his neck to sob outher various emotions of pain and pleasure.Anxious not to appear unhappy, she soon recovered herself; and wipingaway her tears, was able to notice and admire all the striking partsof his dress; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes ofbeing on shore some part of every day before they sailed, and even ofgetting her to Spithead to see the sloop.The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon of the Thrush, avery well-behaved young man, who came to call for his friend, and forwhom there was with some contrivance found a chair, and with some hastywashing of the young tea-maker's, a cup and saucer; and after anotherquarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen, noise risingupon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and boys at last all in motiontogether, the moment came for setting off; everything was ready, Williamtook leave, and all of them were gone; for the three boys, in spiteof their mother's entreaty, determined to see their brother and Mr.Campbell to the sally-port; and Mr. Price walked off at the same time tocarry back his neighbour's newspaper.Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for; and accordingly,when Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea-things,and Mrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for ashirt-sleeve, which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in thekitchen, the small party of females were pretty well composed, and themother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam readyin time, was at leisure to think of her eldest daughter and the friendsshe had come from.A few inquiries began: but one of the earliest--""How did sister Bertrammanage about her servants?"" ""Was she as much plagued as herself to gettolerable servants?""--soon led her mind away from Northamptonshire, andfixed it on her own domestic grievances, and the shocking character ofall the Portsmouth servants, of whom she believed her own two were thevery worst, engrossed her completely. The Bertrams were all forgottenin detailing the faults of Rebecca, against whom Susan had also muchto depose, and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did seem sothoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny could not helpmodestly presuming that her mother meant to part with her when her yearwas up.""Her year!"" cried Mrs. Price; ""I am sure I hope I shall be rid of herbefore she has staid a year, for that will not be up till November.Servants are come to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it isquite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year. I have no hopeof ever being settled; and if I was to part with Rebecca, I shouldonly get something worse. And yet I do not think I am a very difficultmistress to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there isalways a girl under her, and I often do half the work myself.""Fanny was silent; but not from being convinced that there might not be aremedy found for some of these evils. As she now sat looking at Betsey,she could not but think particularly of another sister, a very prettylittle girl, whom she had left there not much younger when she went intoNorthamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards. There had beensomething remarkably amiable about her. Fanny in those early days hadpreferred her to Susan; and when the news of her death had at lastreached Mansfield, had for a short time been quite afflicted. The sightof Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again, but she wouldnot have pained her mother by alluding to her for the world. Whileconsidering her with these ideas, Betsey, at a small distance, washolding out something to catch her eyes, meaning to screen it at thesame time from Susan's.""What have you got there, my love?"" said Fanny; ""come and shew it tome.""It was a silver knife. Up jumped Susan, claiming it as her own, andtrying to get it away; but the child ran to her mother's protection,and Susan could only reproach, which she did very warmly, and evidentlyhoping to interest Fanny on her side. ""It was very hard that she was notto have her _own_ knife; it was her own knife; little sister Mary hadleft it to her upon her deathbed, and she ought to have had it to keepherself long ago. But mama kept it from her, and was always lettingBetsey get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey wouldspoil it, and get it for her own, though mama had _promised_ her thatBetsey should not have it in her own hands.""Fanny was quite shocked. Every feeling of duty, honour, and tendernesswas wounded by her sister's speech and her mother's reply.""Now, Susan,"" cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice, ""now, how canyou be so cross? You are always quarrelling about that knife. I wish youwould not be so quarrelsome. Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is toyou! But you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you tothe drawer. You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is socross about it. I must hide it another time, Betsey. Poor Mary littlethought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me tokeep, only two hours before she died. Poor little soul! she could butjust speak to be heard, and she said so prettily, 'Let sister Susan havemy knife, mama, when I am dead and buried.' Poor little dear! she was sofond of it, Fanny, that she would have it lay by her in bed, all throughher illness. It was the gift of her good godmother, old Mrs. AdmiralMaxwell, only six weeks before she was taken for death. Poor littlesweet creature! Well, she was taken away from evil to come. My ownBetsey"" (fondling her), ""_you_ have not the luck of such a goodgodmother. Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little peopleas you.""Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but a message tosay she hoped that her god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt herbook. There had been at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing-roomat Mansfield Park about sending her a prayer-book; but no second soundhad been heard of such a purpose. Mrs. Norris, however, had gone homeand taken down two old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but,upon examination, the ardour of generosity went off. One was foundto have too small a print for a child's eyes, and the other to be toocumbersome for her to carry about.Fanny, fatigued and fatigued again, was thankful to accept the firstinvitation of going to bed; and before Betsey had finished her cry atbeing allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister,she was off, leaving all below in confusion and noise again; the boysbegging for toasted cheese, her father calling out for his rum andwater, and Rebecca never where she ought to be.There was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined and scantilyfurnished chamber that she was to share with Susan. The smallness ofthe rooms above and below, indeed, and the narrowness of the passage andstaircase, struck her beyond her imagination. She soon learned to thinkwith respect of her own little attic at Mansfield Park, in _that_ housereckoned too small for anybody's comfort."
Mansfield Park,39,"CHAPTER XXXIXCould Sir Thomas have seen all his niece's feelings, when she wrote herfirst letter to her aunt, he would not have despaired; for though a goodnight's rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William again,and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and Charlesbeing gone to school, Sam on some project of his own, and her fatheron his usual lounges, enabled her to express herself cheerfully on thesubject of home, there were still, to her own perfect consciousness,many drawbacks suppressed. Could he have seen only half that she feltbefore the end of a week, he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure ofher, and been delighted with his own sagacity.Before the week ended, it was all disappointment. In the first place,William was gone. The Thrush had had her orders, the wind had changed,and he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth; andduring those days she had seen him only twice, in a short andhurried way, when he had come ashore on duty. There had been no freeconversation, no walk on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, noacquaintance with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned anddepended on. Everything in that quarter failed her, except William'saffection. His last thought on leaving home was for her. He stepped backagain to the door to say, ""Take care of Fanny, mother. She is tender,and not used to rough it like the rest of us. I charge you, take care ofFanny.""William was gone: and the home he had left her in was, Fanny could notconceal it from herself, in almost every respect the very reverse ofwhat she could have wished. It was the abode of noise, disorder, andimpropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as itought to be. She could not respect her parents as she had hoped. On herfather, her confidence had not been sanguine, but he was more negligentof his family, his habits were worse, and his manners coarser, thanshe had been prepared for. He did not want abilities but he had nocuriosity, and no information beyond his profession; he read onlythe newspaper and the navy-list; he talked only of the dockyard, theharbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank; he swore and he drank, he wasdirty and gross. She had never been able to recall anything approachingto tenderness in his former treatment of herself. There had remainedonly a general impression of roughness and loudness; and now he scarcelyever noticed her, but to make her the object of a coarse joke.Her disappointment in her mother was greater: _there_ she had hopedmuch, and found almost nothing. Every flattering scheme of being ofconsequence to her soon fell to the ground. Mrs. Price was not unkind;but, instead of gaining on her affection and confidence, and becomingmore and more dear, her daughter never met with greater kindness fromher than on the first day of her arrival. The instinct of nature wassoon satisfied, and Mrs. Price's attachment had no other source. Herheart and her time were already quite full; she had neither leisure noraffection to bestow on Fanny. Her daughters never had been much to her.She was fond of her sons, especially of William, but Betsey was thefirst of her girls whom she had ever much regarded. To her she was mostinjudiciously indulgent. William was her pride; Betsey her darling;and John, Richard, Sam, Tom, and Charles occupied all the rest of hermaternal solicitude, alternately her worries and her comforts. Theseshared her heart: her time was given chiefly to her house and herservants. Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busywithout getting on, always behindhand and lamenting it, without alteringher ways; wishing to be an economist, without contrivance or regularity;dissatisfied with her servants, without skill to make them better, andwhether helping, or reprimanding, or indulging them, without any powerof engaging their respect.Of her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertramthan Mrs. Norris. She was a manager by necessity, without any of Mrs.Norris's inclination for it, or any of her activity. Her dispositionwas naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram's; and a situation ofsimilar affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more suitedto her capacity than the exertions and self-denials of the one which herimprudent marriage had placed her in. She might have made just as good awoman of consequence as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris would have been amore respectable mother of nine children on a small income.Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of. She might scrupleto make use of the words, but she must and did feel that her mother wasa partial, ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taughtnor restrained her children, whose house was the scene of mismanagementand discomfort from beginning to end, and who had no talent, noconversation, no affection towards herself; no curiosity to know herbetter, no desire of her friendship, and no inclination for her companythat could lessen her sense of such feelings.Fanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above her home,or in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her foreign education,from contributing her help to its comforts, and therefore set aboutworking for Sam immediately; and by working early and late, withperseverance and great despatch, did so much that the boy was shippedoff at last, with more than half his linen ready. She had great pleasurein feeling her usefulness, but could not conceive how they would havemanaged without her.Sam, loud and overbearing as he was, she rather regretted when he went,for he was clever and intelligent, and glad to be employed in any errandin the town; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan, given asthey were, though very reasonable in themselves, with ill-timed andpowerless warmth, was beginning to be influenced by Fanny's servicesand gentle persuasions; and she found that the best of the three youngerones was gone in him: Tom and Charles being at least as many years asthey were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason, whichmight suggest the expediency of making friends, and of endeavouring tobe less disagreeable. Their sister soon despaired of making the smallestimpression on _them_; they were quite untameable by any means of addresswhich she had spirits or time to attempt. Every afternoon brought areturn of their riotous games all over the house; and she very earlylearned to sigh at the approach of Saturday's constant half-holiday.Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet hergreatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her pleasure, andthen encouraged to report any evil of them, she was almost as ready todespair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan's temper shehad many doubts. Her continual disagreements with her mother, her rashsquabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at leastso distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no meanswithout provocation, she feared the disposition that could push them tosuch length must be far from amiable, and from affording any repose toherself.Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head, andteach her to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings. On thecontrary, she could think of nothing but Mansfield, its beloved inmates,its happy ways. Everything where she now was in full contrast to it. Theelegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps, above all, thepeace and tranquillity of Mansfield, were brought to her remembranceevery hour of the day, by the prevalence of everything opposite to them_here_.The living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate andnervous like Fanny's, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmonycould have entirely atoned for. It was the greatest misery of all. AtMansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts,no tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular courseof cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance; everybody'sfeelings were consulted. If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting,good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and as to the littleirritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they were short, theywere trifling, they were as a drop of water to the ocean, compared withthe ceaseless tumult of her present abode. Here everybody was noisy,every voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her mother's, which resembledthe soft monotony of Lady Bertram's, only worn into fretfulness).Whatever was wanted was hallooed for, and the servants hallooed outtheir excuses from the kitchen. The doors were in constant banging, thestairs were never at rest, nothing was done without a clatter, nobodysat still, and nobody could command attention when they spoke.In a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her before the endof a week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson's celebratedjudgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though MansfieldPark might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures."
Mansfield Park,40,"CHAPTER XLFanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford nowat the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun; Mary's nextletter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last, but shewas not right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a greatrelief to herself. Here was another strange revolution of mind! She wasreally glad to receive the letter when it did come. In her present exilefrom good society, and distance from everything that had been wont tointerest her, a letter from one belonging to the set where her heartlived, written with affection, and some degree of elegance, wasthoroughly acceptable. The usual plea of increasing engagements was madein excuse for not having written to her earlier; ""And now that I havebegun,"" she continued, ""my letter will not be worth your reading, forthere will be no little offering of love at the end, no three or fourlines _passionnees_ from the most devoted H. C. in the world, forHenry is in Norfolk; business called him to Everingham ten days ago, orperhaps he only pretended to call, for the sake of being travellingat the same time that you were. But there he is, and, by the bye, hisabsence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister's inwriting, for there has been no 'Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny?Is not it time for you to write to Fanny?' to spur me on. At last, aftervarious attempts at meeting, I have seen your cousins, 'dear Julia anddearest Mrs. Rushworth'; they found me at home yesterday, and we wereglad to see each other again. We _seemed_ _very_ glad to see each other,and I do really think we were a little. We had a vast deal to say. ShallI tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned? I didnot use to think her wanting in self-possession, but she had not quiteenough for the demands of yesterday. Upon the whole, Julia was in thebest looks of the two, at least after you were spoken of. There was norecovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of 'Fanny,' andspoke of her as a sister should. But Mrs. Rushworth's day of good lookswill come; we have cards for her first party on the 28th. Then shewill be in beauty, for she will open one of the best houses in WimpoleStreet. I was in it two years ago, when it was Lady Lascelle's, andprefer it to almost any I know in London, and certainly she will thenfeel, to use a vulgar phrase, that she has got her pennyworth for herpenny. Henry could not have afforded her such a house. I hope she willrecollect it, and be satisfied, as well as she may, with moving thequeen of a palace, though the king may appear best in the background;and as I have no desire to tease her, I shall never _force_ your nameupon her again. She will grow sober by degrees. From all that I hearand guess, Baron Wildenheim's attentions to Julia continue, but I do notknow that he has any serious encouragement. She ought to do better.A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine any liking in thecase, for take away his rants, and the poor baron has nothing. What adifference a vowel makes! If his rents were but equal to his rants! Yourcousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by parish duties. Theremay be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted. I am unwillingto fancy myself neglected for a _young_ one. Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny,this is a long letter from London: write me a pretty one in reply togladden Henry's eyes, when he comes back, and send me an account of allthe dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake.""There was great food for meditation in this letter, and chiefly forunpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it supplied, itconnected her with the absent, it told her of people and things aboutwhom she had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she wouldhave been glad to have been sure of such a letter every week. Hercorrespondence with her aunt Bertram was her only concern of higherinterest.As for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make amends fordeficiencies at home, there were none within the circle of her father'sand mother's acquaintance to afford her the smallest satisfaction: shesaw nobody in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own shynessand reserve. The men appeared to her all coarse, the women all pert,everybody underbred; and she gave as little contentment as she receivedfrom introductions either to old or new acquaintance. The young ladieswho approached her at first with some respect, in consideration of hercoming from a baronet's family, were soon offended by what they termed""airs""; for, as she neither played on the pianoforte nor wore finepelisses, they could, on farther observation, admit no right ofsuperiority.The first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home,the first which her judgment could entirely approve, and which gave anypromise of durability, was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope ofbeing of service to her. Susan had always behaved pleasantly to herself,but the determined character of her general manners had astonishedand alarmed her, and it was at least a fortnight before she began tounderstand a disposition so totally different from her own. Susan sawthat much was wrong at home, and wanted to set it right. That a girl offourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason, should err in themethod of reform, was not wonderful; and Fanny soon became more disposedto admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguishjustly, than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led.Susan was only acting on the same truths, and pursuing the same system,which her own judgment acknowledged, but which her more supine andyielding temper would have shrunk from asserting. Susan tried to beuseful, where _she_ could only have gone away and cried; and that Susanwas useful she could perceive; that things, bad as they were, wouldhave been worse but for such interposition, and that both her mother andBetsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgenceand vulgarity.In every argument with her mother, Susan had in point of reason theadvantage, and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off.The blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she hadnever known. There was no gratitude for affection past or present tomake her better bear with its excesses to the others.All this became gradually evident, and gradually placed Susan before hersister as an object of mingled compassion and respect. That her mannerwas wrong, however, at times very wrong, her measures often ill-chosenand ill-timed, and her looks and language very often indefensible, Fannycould not cease to feel; but she began to hope they might be rectified.Susan, she found, looked up to her and wished for her good opinion; andnew as anything like an office of authority was to Fanny, new as itwas to imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one, she didresolve to give occasional hints to Susan, and endeavour to exercise forher advantage the juster notions of what was due to everybody, and whatwould be wisest for herself, which her own more favoured education hadfixed in her.Her influence, or at least the consciousness and use of it, originatedin an act of kindness by Susan, which, after many hesitations ofdelicacy, she at last worked herself up to. It had very early occurredto her that a small sum of money might, perhaps, restore peace forever on the sore subject of the silver knife, canvassed as it now wascontinually, and the riches which she was in possession of herself,her uncle having given her 10 pounds at parting, made her as able as she waswilling to be generous. But she was so wholly unused to confer favours,except on the very poor, so unpractised in removing evils, or bestowingkindnesses among her equals, and so fearful of appearing to elevateherself as a great lady at home, that it took some time to determinethat it would not be unbecoming in her to make such a present. Itwas made, however, at last: a silver knife was bought for Betsey, andaccepted with great delight, its newness giving it every advantageover the other that could be desired; Susan was established in the fullpossession of her own, Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had gotone so much prettier herself, she should never want _that_ again; andno reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother, which Fannyhad almost feared to be impossible. The deed thoroughly answered: asource of domestic altercation was entirely done away, and it was themeans of opening Susan's heart to her, and giving her something more tolove and be interested in. Susan shewed that she had delicacy: pleasedas she was to be mistress of property which she had been struggling forat least two years, she yet feared that her sister's judgment had beenagainst her, and that a reproof was designed her for having so struggledas to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of the house.Her temper was open. She acknowledged her fears, blamed herself forhaving contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny, understanding theworth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined toseek her good opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again theblessing of affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to amind so much in need of help, and so much deserving it. She gave advice,advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding, and given somildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect temper, and shehad the happiness of observing its good effects not unfrequently.More was not expected by one who, while seeing all the obligation andexpediency of submission and forbearance, saw also with sympatheticacuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating to a girl likeSusan. Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became--not that Susanshould have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against herbetter knowledge--but that so much better knowledge, so many goodnotions should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the midstof negligence and error, she should have formed such proper opinionsof what ought to be; she, who had had no cousin Edmund to direct herthoughts or fix her principles.The intimacy thus begun between them was a material advantage toeach. By sitting together upstairs, they avoided a great deal of thedisturbance of the house; Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think itno misfortune to be quietly employed. They sat without a fire; butthat was a privation familiar even to Fanny, and she suffered theless because reminded by it of the East room. It was the only point ofresemblance. In space, light, furniture, and prospect, there wasnothing alike in the two apartments; and she often heaved a sigh at theremembrance of all her books and boxes, and various comforts there. Bydegrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, atfirst only in working and talking, but after a few days, the remembranceof the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny found itimpossible not to try for books again. There were none in her father'shouse; but wealth is luxurious and daring, and some of hers found itsway to a circulating library. She became a subscriber; amazed at beinganything _in propria persona_, amazed at her own doings in every way, tobe a renter, a chuser of books! And to be having any one's improvementin view in her choice! But so it was. Susan had read nothing, and Fannylonged to give her a share in her own first pleasures, and inspire ataste for the biography and poetry which she delighted in herself.In this occupation she hoped, moreover, to bury some of therecollections of Mansfield, which were too apt to seize her mind if herfingers only were busy; and, especially at this time, hoped it mightbe useful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London,whither, on the authority of her aunt's last letter, she knew he wasgone. She had no doubt of what would ensue. The promised notificationwas hanging over her head. The postman's knock within the neighbourhoodwas beginning to bring its daily terrors, and if reading could banishthe idea for even half an hour, it was something gained."
Mansfield Park,41,"CHAPTER XLIA week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny hadheard nothing of him. There were three different conclusions to be drawnfrom his silence, between which her mind was in fluctuation; each ofthem at times being held the most probable. Either his going had beenagain delayed, or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing MissCrawford alone, or he was too happy for letter-writing!One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeksfrom Mansfield, a point which she never failed to think over andcalculate every day, as she and Susan were preparing to remove, asusual, upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom theyfelt they could not avoid, from Rebecca's alertness in going to thedoor, a duty which always interested her beyond any other.It was a gentleman's voice; it was a voice that Fanny was just turningpale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the room.Good sense, like hers, will always act when really called upon; and shefound that she had been able to name him to her mother, and recall herremembrance of the name, as that of ""William's friend,"" though she couldnot previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllableat such a moment. The consciousness of his being known there only asWilliam's friend was some support. Having introduced him, however, andbeing all reseated, the terrors that occurred of what this visit mightlead to were overpowering, and she fancied herself on the point offainting away.While trying to keep herself alive, their visitor, who had at firstapproached her with as animated a countenance as ever, was wisely andkindly keeping his eyes away, and giving her time to recover, while hedevoted himself entirely to her mother, addressing her, and attendingto her with the utmost politeness and propriety, at the same time witha degree of friendliness, of interest at least, which was making hismanner perfect.Mrs. Price's manners were also at their best. Warmed by the sight ofsuch a friend to her son, and regulated by the wish of appearing toadvantage before him, she was overflowing with gratitude--artless,maternal gratitude--which could not be unpleasing. Mr. Price was out,which she regretted very much. Fanny was just recovered enough tofeel that _she_ could not regret it; for to her many other sources ofuneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which hefound her. She might scold herself for the weakness, but there was noscolding it away. She was ashamed, and she would have been yet moreashamed of her father than of all the rest.They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire;and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart couldwish. She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life;and was only astonished to find that, so great and so agreeable as hewas, he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to theport-admiral, nor the commissioner, nor yet with the intention of goingover to the island, nor of seeing the dockyard. Nothing of all that shehad been used to think of as the proof of importance, or the employmentof wealth, had brought him to Portsmouth. He had reached it late thenight before, was come for a day or two, was staying at the Crown, hadaccidentally met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance sincehis arrival, but had no object of that kind in coming.By the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonableto suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she wastolerably able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hourwith his sister the evening before his leaving London; that she hadsent her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that hethought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having spentscarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his return from Norfolk,before he set off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town, had been intown, he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him himself, butthat he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and was to dine,as yesterday, with the Frasers.Fanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned circumstance;nay, it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty; and thewords, ""then by this time it is all settled,"" passed internally, withoutmore evidence of emotion than a faint blush.After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which herinterest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency ofan early walk. ""It was a lovely morning, and at that season of the yeara fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybodynot to delay their exercise""; and such hints producing nothing, he soonproceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and herdaughters to take their walk without loss of time. Now they came to anunderstanding. Mrs. Price, it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out ofdoors, except of a Sunday; she owned she could seldom, with her largefamily, find time for a walk. ""Would she not, then, persuade herdaughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him the pleasureof attending them?"" Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying.""Her daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place; theydid not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the town,which they would be very glad to do."" And the consequence was, thatFanny, strange as it was--strange, awkward, and distressing--foundherself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Streetwith Mr. Crawford.It was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion; for they werehardly in the High Street before they met her father, whoseappearance was not the better from its being Saturday. He stopt; and,ungentlemanlike as he looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr.Crawford. She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawfordmust be struck. He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether. He mustsoon give her up, and cease to have the smallest inclination for thematch; and yet, though she had been so much wanting his affection tobe cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as thecomplaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the UnitedKingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being soughtby a clever, agreeable man, than have him driven away by the vulgarityof her nearest relations.Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father-in-law with anyidea of taking him for a model in dress; but (as Fanny instantly, and toher great relief, discerned) her father was a very different man, avery different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respectedstranger, from what he was in his own family at home. His mannersnow, though not polished, were more than passable: they were grateful,animated, manly; his expressions were those of an attached father, anda sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the open air, and therewas not a single oath to be heard. Such was his instinctive complimentto the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the consequence what itmight, Fanny's immediate feelings were infinitely soothed.The conclusion of the two gentlemen's civilities was an offer of Mr.Price's to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, thoughhe had seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much thelonger with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, ifthe Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow orother ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they werenot at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but forMr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without thesmallest consideration for his daughters' errands in the High Street. Hetook care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the shops theycame out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long, for Fannycould so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for, that beforethe gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more than begin uponthe last naval regulations, or settle the number of three-deckers now incommission, their companions were ready to proceed.They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walkwould have been conducted--according to Mr. Crawford's opinion--in asingular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it,as the two girls, he found, would have been left to follow, and keep upwith them or not, as they could, while they walked on together at theirown hasty pace. He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally,though by no means to the extent he wished; he absolutely would not walkaway from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when Mr. Price wasonly calling out, ""Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue, take care ofyourselves; keep a sharp lookout!"" he would give them his particularattendance.Once fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon some happyintercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brotherlounger of Mr. Price's, who was come to take his daily survey of howthings went on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion thanhimself; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfiedgoing about together, and discussing matters of equal and never-failinginterest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard,or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went tolook at. Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford could nothave wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but he couldhave wished her sister away. A quick-looking girl of Susan's age was thevery worst third in the world: totally different from Lady Bertram, alleyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main point before her.He must content himself with being only generally agreeable, and lettingSusan have her share of entertainment, with the indulgence, now andthen, of a look or hint for the better-informed and conscious Fanny.Norfolk was what he had mostly to talk of: there he had been some time,and everything there was rising in importance from his present schemes.Such a man could come from no place, no society, without importingsomething to amuse; his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use,and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her. For Fanny, somewhatmore was related than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he hadbeen in. For her approbation, the particular reason of his going intoNorfolk at all, at this unusual time of year, was given. It had beenreal business, relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfareof a large and--he believed--industrious family was at stake. He hadsuspected his agent of some underhand dealing; of meaning to biashim against the deserving; and he had determined to go himself, andthoroughly investigate the merits of the case. He had gone, had doneeven more good than he had foreseen, had been useful to more than hisfirst plan had comprehended, and was now able to congratulate himselfupon it, and to feel that in performing a duty, he had secured agreeablerecollections for his own mind. He had introduced himself to sometenants whom he had never seen before; he had begun making acquaintancewith cottages whose very existence, though on his own estate, had beenhitherto unknown to him. This was aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny. Itwas pleasing to hear him speak so properly; here he had been acting ashe ought to do. To be the friend of the poor and the oppressed! Nothingcould be more grateful to her; and she was on the point of giving him anapproving look, when it was all frightened off by his adding a somethingtoo pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant, a friend, a guidein every plan of utility or charity for Everingham: a somebody thatwould make Everingham and all about it a dearer object than it had everbeen yet.She turned away, and wished he would not say such things. She waswilling to allow he might have more good qualities than she had beenwont to suppose. She began to feel the possibility of his turning outwell at last; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her,and ought not to think of her.He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham, and that it wouldbe as well to talk of something else, and turned to Mansfield. He couldnot have chosen better; that was a topic to bring back her attention andher looks almost instantly. It was a real indulgence to her to hear orto speak of Mansfield. Now so long divided from everybody who knew theplace, she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it,and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties andcomforts, and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed herto gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of heruncle as all that was clever and good, and her aunt as having thesweetest of all sweet tempers.He had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he said so; he lookedforward with the hope of spending much, very much, of his time there;always there, or in the neighbourhood. He particularly built upon a veryhappy summer and autumn there this year; he felt that it would be so: hedepended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last.As animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances ofsuperiority undescribable.""Mansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey,"" he continued; ""what a societywill be comprised in those houses! And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourthmay be added: some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything sodear; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertramonce good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee two objections: twofair, excellent, irresistible objections to that plan.""Fanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment was passed,could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledgedcomprehension of one half of his meaning, and encouraged him to saysomething more of his sister and Edmund. It was a subject which she mustlearn to speak of, and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon bequite unpardonable.When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished, or had timefor, the others were ready to return; and in the course of their walkback, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute's privacy for telling Fanny thathis only business in Portsmouth was to see her; that he was come downfor a couple of days on her account, and hers only, and because he couldnot endure a longer total separation. She was sorry, really sorry; andyet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wishedhe had not said, she thought him altogether improved since she had seenhim; he was much more gentle, obliging, and attentive to other people'sfeelings than he had ever been at Mansfield; she had never seen him soagreeable--so _near_ being agreeable; his behaviour to her father couldnot offend, and there was something particularly kind and proper in thenotice he took of Susan. He was decidedly improved. She wished the nextday over, she wished he had come only for one day; but it was notso very bad as she would have expected: the pleasure of talking ofMansfield was so very great!Before they parted, she had to thank him for another pleasure, and oneof no trivial kind. Her father asked him to do them the honour of takinghis mutton with them, and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror,before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement. He wasengaged to dinner already both for that day and the next; he had metwith some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied; he shouldhave the honour, however, of waiting on them again on the morrow, etc.,and so they parted--Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping sohorrible an evil!To have had him join their family dinner-party, and see all theirdeficiencies, would have been dreadful! Rebecca's cookery and Rebecca'swaiting, and Betsey's eating at table without restraint, and pullingeverything about as she chose, were what Fanny herself was not yetenough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal. _She_ was niceonly from natural delicacy, but _he_ had been brought up in a school ofluxury and epicurism."
Mansfield Park,42,"CHAPTER XLIIThe Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr.Crawford appeared again. He came, not to stop, but to join them; he wasasked to go with them to the Garrison chapel, which was exactly what hehad intended, and they all walked thither together.The family were now seen to advantage. Nature had given them noinconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday dressed them in theircleanest skins and best attire. Sunday always brought this comfort toFanny, and on this Sunday she felt it more than ever. Her poor mothernow did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram's sister as shewas but too apt to look. It often grieved her to the heart to think ofthe contrast between them; to think that where nature had made so littledifference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her mother,as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should have anappearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so slatternly,so shabby. But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerablycheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family ofchildren, feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and onlydiscomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by witha flower in her hat.In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford took care not tobe divided from the female branch; and after chapel he still continuedwith them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sundaythroughout the year, always going directly after morning service andstaying till dinner-time. It was her public place: there she met heracquaintance, heard a little news, talked over the badness of thePortsmouth servants, and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing.Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the MissPrices as his peculiar charge; and before they had been there long,somehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have believedit, but he was walking between them with an arm of each under his,and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it. It made heruncomfortable for a time, but yet there were enjoyments in the day andin the view which would be felt.The day was uncommonly lovely. It was really March; but it was April inits mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun, occasionally clouded fora minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of sucha sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships atSpithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the sea,now at high water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the rampartswith so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination of charmsfor Fanny, as made her gradually almost careless of the circumstancesunder which she felt them. Nay, had she been without his arm, she wouldsoon have known that she needed it, for she wanted strength for a twohours' saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally did, upon a week'sprevious inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the effect of beingdebarred from her usual regular exercise; she had lost ground as tohealth since her being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr. Crawford and thebeauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up now.The loveliness of the day, and of the view, he felt like herself. Theyoften stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning against the wall,some minutes, to look and admire; and considering he was not Edmund,Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the charmsof nature, and very well able to express his admiration. She had a fewtender reveries now and then, which he could sometimes take advantageof to look in her face without detection; and the result of these lookswas, that though as bewitching as ever, her face was less blooming thanit ought to be. She _said_ she was very well, and did not like to besupposed otherwise; but take it all in all, he was convinced that herpresent residence could not be comfortable, and therefore could notbe salutary for her, and he was growing anxious for her being again atMansfield, where her own happiness, and his in seeing her, must be somuch greater.""You have been here a month, I think?"" said he.""No; not quite a month. It is only four weeks to-morrow since I leftMansfield.""""You are a most accurate and honest reckoner. I should call that amonth.""""I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening.""""And it is to be a two months' visit, is not?""""Yes. My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less.""""And how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?""""I do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. PerhapsI may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetchedexactly at the two months' end.""After a moment's reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, ""I know Mansfield, Iknow its way, I know its faults towards _you_. I know the danger ofyour being so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to theimaginary convenience of any single being in the family. I am awarethat you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settleeverything for coming himself, or sending your aunt's maid for you,without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which hemay have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do. Twomonths is an ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite enough.I am considering your sister's health,"" said he, addressing himself toSusan, ""which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to. Sherequires constant air and exercise. When you know her as well as I do,I am sure you will agree that she does, and that she ought never tobe long banished from the free air and liberty of the country. If,therefore"" (turning again to Fanny), ""you find yourself growing unwell,and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield, withoutwaiting for the two months to be ended, _that_ must not be regardedas of any consequence, if you feel yourself at all less strong orcomfortable than usual, and will only let my sister know it, give heronly the slightest hint, she and I will immediately come down, and takeyou back to Mansfield. You know the ease and the pleasure with whichthis would be done. You know all that would be felt on the occasion.""Fanny thanked him, but tried to laugh it off.""I am perfectly serious,"" he replied, ""as you perfectly know. And Ihope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition.Indeed, you shall _not_; it shall not be in your power; for so long onlyas you positively say, in every letter to Mary, 'I am well,' and Iknow you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you beconsidered as well.""Fanny thanked him again, but was affected and distressed to a degreethat made it impossible for her to say much, or even to be certain ofwhat she ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk. Heattended them to the last, and left them only at the door of their ownhouse, when he knew them to be going to dinner, and therefore pretendedto be waited for elsewhere.""I wish you were not so tired,"" said he, still detaining Fanny after allthe others were in the house--""I wish I left you in stronger health. Isthere anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of goinginto Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am surehe still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of his owninto a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must come to anunderstanding with him. I must make him know that I will not be trickedon the south side of Everingham, any more than on the north: that I willbe master of my own property. I was not explicit enough with him before.The mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of hisemployer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable. I have a greatmind to go back into Norfolk directly, and put everything at once onsuch a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from. Maddison is aclever fellow; I do not wish to displace him, provided he does not tryto displace _me_; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has noright of creditor to dupe me, and worse than simple to let him give me ahard-hearted, griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man,to whom I have given half a promise already. Would it not be worse thansimple? Shall I go? Do you advise it?""""I advise! You know very well what is right.""""Yes. When you give me your opinion, I always know what is right. Yourjudgment is my rule of right.""""Oh, no! do not say so. We have all a better guide in ourselves, if wewould attend to it, than any other person can be. Good-bye; I wish you apleasant journey to-morrow.""""Is there nothing I can do for you in town?""""Nothing; I am much obliged to you.""""Have you no message for anybody?""""My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, mycousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose Ishall soon hear from him.""""Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excusesmyself.""He could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained. He pressedher hand, looked at her, and was gone. _He_ went to while away the nextthree hours as he could, with his other acquaintance, till the bestdinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment, and_she_ turned in to her more simple one immediately.Their general fare bore a very different character; and could he havesuspected how many privations, besides that of exercise, she endured inher father's house, he would have wondered that her looks were not muchmore affected than he found them. She was so little equal to Rebecca'spuddings and Rebecca's hashes, brought to table, as they all were, withsuch accompaniments of half-cleaned plates, and not half-cleaned knivesand forks, that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiestmeal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits andbuns. After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the dayto be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he known all,might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved,both mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford's goodcompany and good fortune, he would probably have feared to push hisexperiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day. Though tolerablysecure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again, she could not help being low.It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, inone light, glad to have him gone, it seemed as if she was now desertedby everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield; andshe could not think of his returning to town, and being frequently withMary and Edmund, without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hateherself for having them.Her dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her; afriend or two of her father's, as always happened if he was not withthem, spent the long, long evening there; and from six o'clock tillhalf-past nine, there was little intermission of noise or grog. Shewas very low. The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr.Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within thecurrent of her thoughts. Not considering in how different a circle shehad been just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to contrast, shewas quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardfulof others than formerly. And, if in little things, must it not be so ingreat? So anxious for her health and comfort, so very feeling as he nowexpressed himself, and really seemed, might not it be fairly supposedthat he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her?"
Mansfield Park,43,"CHAPTER XLIIIIt was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on themorrow, for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price's; and two daysafterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letterfrom his sister, opened and read by her, on another account, with themost anxious curiosity:--""I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down toPortsmouth to see you; that he had a delightful walk with you to thedockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,on the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweetlooks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony,and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.This, as well as I understand, is to be the substance of my information.He makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be communicated,except this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said walks, and hisintroduction to your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, afine girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts, taking herfirst lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for writing much, butit would be out of place if I had, for this is to be a mere letter ofbusiness, penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information,which could not be delayed without risk of evil. My dear, dear Fanny,if I had you here, how I would talk to you! You should listen to me tillyou were tired, and advise me till you were still tired more; but it isimpossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper, so I willabstain altogether, and leave you to guess what you like. I have no newsfor you. You have politics, of course; and it would be too bad to plagueyou with the names of people and parties that fill up my time. I oughtto have sent you an account of your cousin's first party, but I waslazy, and now it is too long ago; suffice it, that everything was justas it ought to be, in a style that any of her connexions must have beengratified to witness, and that her own dress and manners did her thegreatest credit. My friend, Mrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and itwould not make _me_ miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter;she seems in high spirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is verygood-humoured and pleasant in his own family, and I do not think him sovery ill-looking as I did--at least, one sees many worse. He will notdo by the side of your cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, whatshall I say? If I avoided his name entirely, it would look suspicious.I will say, then, that we have seen him two or three times, and thatmy friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance.Mrs. Fraser (no bad judge) declares she knows but three men in townwho have so good a person, height, and air; and I must confess, when hedined here the other day, there were none to compare with him, andwe were a party of sixteen. Luckily there is no distinction of dressnowadays to tell tales, but--but--but Yours affectionately.""""I had almost forgot (it was Edmund's fault: he gets into my head morethan does me good) one very material thing I had to say from Henry andmyself--I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire. My dearlittle creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks.Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor auntalways felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiralof course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your serviceand Henry's, at an hour's notice. I should like the scheme, and we wouldmake a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way, and perhapsyou would not mind passing through London, and seeing the inside of St.George's, Hanover Square. Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at sucha time: I should not like to be tempted. What a long letter! one wordmore. Henry, I find, has some idea of going into Norfolk again uponsome business that _you_ approve; but this cannot possibly be permittedbefore the middle of next week; that is, he cannot anyhow be spared tillafter the 14th, for _we_ have a party that evening. The value of a manlike Henry, on such an occasion, is what you can have no conceptionof; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable. He will see theRushworths, which own I am not sorry for--having a little curiosity, andso I think has he--though he will not acknowledge it.""This was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be read deliberately,to supply matter for much reflection, and to leave everything in greatersuspense than ever. The only certainty to be drawn from it was, thatnothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet spoken. HowMiss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act, or might act withoutor against her meaning; whether his importance to her were quite whatit had been before the last separation; whether, if lessened, it werelikely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were subjects for endlessconjecture, and to be thought of on that day and many days to come,without producing any conclusion. The idea that returned the oftenestwas that Miss Crawford, after proving herself cooled and staggered bya return to London habits, would yet prove herself in the end too muchattached to him to give him up. She would try to be more ambitious thanher heart would allow. She would hesitate, she would tease, she wouldcondition, she would require a great deal, but she would finally accept.This was Fanny's most frequent expectation. A house in town--that, shethought, must be impossible. Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawfordmight not ask. The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse. Thewoman who could speak of him, and speak only of his appearance! What anunworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations ofMrs. Fraser! _She_ who had known him intimately half a year! Fanny wasashamed of her. Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr.Crawford and herself, touched her, in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr.Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly noconcern of hers, though, everything considered, she thought he _would_go without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure ameeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line ofconduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_ wouldnot be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He acknowledged no suchinducement, and his sister ought to have given him credit for betterfeelings than her own.She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receivingthis than she had been before; and for a few days was so unsettled byit altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her usualreadings and conversation with Susan were much suspended. She couldnot command her attention as she wished. If Mr. Crawford remembered hermessage to her cousin, she thought it very likely, most likely, that hewould write to her at all events; it would be most consistent with hisusual kindness; and till she got rid of this idea, till it graduallywore off, by no letters appearing in the course of three or four daysmore, she was in a most restless, anxious state.At length, a something like composure succeeded. Suspense must besubmitted to, and must not be allowed to wear her out, and make heruseless. Time did something, her own exertions something more, and sheresumed her attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest inthem.Susan was growing very fond of her, and though without any of the earlydelight in books which had been so strong in Fanny, with a dispositionmuch less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information forinformation's sake, she had so strong a desire of not _appearing_ignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her a mostattentive, profitable, thankful pupil. Fanny was her oracle. Fanny'sexplanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay,or every chapter of history. What Fanny told her of former times dweltmore on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she paid her sisterthe compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author.The early habit of reading was wanting.Their conversations, however, were not always on subjects so high ashistory or morals. Others had their hour; and of lesser matters, nonereturned so often, or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park,a description of the people, the manners, the amusements, the waysof Mansfield Park. Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel andwell-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulgeherself in dwelling on so beloved a theme. She hoped it was not wrong;though, after a time, Susan's very great admiration of everythingsaid or done in her uncle's house, and earnest longing to go intoNorthamptonshire, seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings whichcould not be gratified.Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister;and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this, she began to feel thatwhen her own release from Portsmouth came, her happiness would have amaterial drawback in leaving Susan behind. That a girl so capable ofbeing made everything good should be left in such hands, distressed hermore and more. Were _she_ likely to have a home to invite her to, whata blessing it would be! And had it been possible for her to return Mr.Crawford's regard, the probability of his being very far from objectingto such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her owncomforts. She thought he was really good-tempered, and could fancy hisentering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly."
Mansfield Park,44,"CHAPTER XLIVSeven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone, when the oneletter, the letter from Edmund, so long expected, was put into Fanny'shands. As she opened, and saw its length, she prepared herself for aminute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towardsthe fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate. These were thecontents--""My Dear Fanny,--Excuse me that I have not written before. Crawford toldme that you were wishing to hear from me, but I found it impossible towrite from London, and persuaded myself that you would understand mysilence. Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not have beenwanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power. I am returnedto Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it. My hopes aremuch weaker. You are probably aware of this already. So very fond of youas Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell you enoughof her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine. I will not beprevented, however, from making my own communication. Our confidences inyou need not clash. I ask no questions. There is something soothingin the idea that we have the same friend, and that whatever unhappydifferences of opinion may exist between us, we are united in our loveof you. It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are, andwhat are my present plans, if plans I can be said to have. I have beenreturned since Saturday. I was three weeks in London, and saw her (forLondon) very often. I had every attention from the Frasers that could bereasonably expected. I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying withme hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield. It was hermanner, however, rather than any unfrequency of meeting. Had she beendifferent when I did see her, I should have made no complaint, but fromthe very first she was altered: my first reception was so unlike what Ihad hoped, that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly.I need not particularise. You know the weak side of her character, andmay imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me. Shewas in high spirits, and surrounded by those who were giving all thesupport of their own bad sense to her too lively mind. I do not likeMrs. Fraser. She is a cold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirelyfrom convenience, and though evidently unhappy in her marriage,places her disappointment not to faults of judgment, or temper, ordisproportion of age, but to her being, after all, less affluent thanmany of her acquaintance, especially than her sister, Lady Stornaway,and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious,provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough. I look upon herintimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her lifeand mine. They have been leading her astray for years. Could she bedetached from them!--and sometimes I do not despair of it, for theaffection appears to me principally on their side. They are very fond ofher; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you. When I thinkof her great attachment to you, indeed, and the whole of her judicious,upright conduct as a sister, she appears a very different creature,capable of everything noble, and I am ready to blame myself for a tooharsh construction of a playful manner. I cannot give her up, Fanny. Sheis the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife. IfI did not believe that she had some regard for me, of course I shouldnot say this, but I do believe it. I am convinced that she is notwithout a decided preference. I have no jealousy of any individual. Itis the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealousof. It is the habits of wealth that I fear. Her ideas are not higherthan her own fortune may warrant, but they are beyond what our incomesunited could authorise. There is comfort, however, even here. I couldbetter bear to lose her because not rich enough, than because of myprofession. That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices,which, in fact, I am scarcely justified in asking; and, if I am refused,that, I think, will be the honest motive. Her prejudices, I trust, arenot so strong as they were. You have my thoughts exactly as they arise,my dear Fanny; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory, but it willnot be a less faithful picture of my mind. Having once begun, it is apleasure to me to tell you all I feel. I cannot give her up. Connectedas we already are, and, I hope, are to be, to give up Mary Crawfordwould be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me; tobanish myself from the very houses and friends whom, under any otherdistress, I should turn to for consolation. The loss of Mary I mustconsider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny. Were it adecided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I should know how to bear it,and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart, and in the courseof a few years--but I am writing nonsense. Were I refused, I must bearit; and till I am, I can never cease to try for her. This is the truth.The only question is _how_? What may be the likeliest means? I havesometimes thought of going to London again after Easter, and sometimesresolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield. Even now, shespeaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June; but June is ata great distance, and I believe I shall write to her. I have nearlydetermined on explaining myself by letter. To be at an early certaintyis a material object. My present state is miserably irksome. Consideringeverything, I think a letter will be decidedly the best method ofexplanation. I shall be able to write much that I could not say, andshall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on heranswer, and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of animmediate hasty impulse; I think I am. My greatest danger would lie inher consulting Mrs. Fraser, and I at a distance unable to help my owncause. A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation, and wherethe mind is anything short of perfect decision, an adviser may, in anunlucky moment, lead it to do what it may afterwards regret. I mustthink this matter over a little. This long letter, full of my ownconcerns alone, will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny.The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser's party. I am moreand more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him. There is not ashadow of wavering. He thoroughly knows his own mind, and acts up to hisresolutions: an inestimable quality. I could not see him and my eldestsister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me,and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends. There wasmarked coolness on her side. They scarcely spoke. I saw him draw backsurprised, and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any formersupposed slight to Miss Bertram. You will wish to hear my opinionof Maria's degree of comfort as a wife. There is no appearance ofunhappiness. I hope they get on pretty well together. I dined twice inWimpole Street, and might have been there oftener, but it is mortifyingto be with Rushworth as a brother. Julia seems to enjoy Londonexceedingly. I had little enjoyment there, but have less here. We arenot a lively party. You are very much wanted. I miss you more than Ican express. My mother desires her best love, and hopes to hear fromyou soon. She talks of you almost every hour, and I am sorry to findhow many weeks more she is likely to be without you. My father meansto fetch you himself, but it will not be till after Easter, when he hasbusiness in town. You are happy at Portsmouth, I hope, but this mustnot be a yearly visit. I want you at home, that I may have your opinionabout Thornton Lacey. I have little heart for extensive improvementstill I know that it will ever have a mistress. I think I shall certainlywrite. It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath; they leaveMansfield on Monday. I am glad of it. I am not comfortable enough to befit for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such anarticle of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.--Yoursever, my dearest Fanny.""""I never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a letter again,"" wasFanny's secret declaration as she finished this. ""What do they bring butdisappointment and sorrow? Not till after Easter! How shall I bear it?And my poor aunt talking of me every hour!""Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could, butshe was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas wasquite unkind, both to her aunt and to herself. As for the main subjectof the letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She wasalmost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund. ""There is nogood in this delay,"" said she. ""Why is not it settled? He is blinded,and nothing will open his eyes; nothing can, after having had truthsbefore him so long in vain. He will marry her, and be poor andmiserable. God grant that her influence do not make him cease to berespectable!"" She looked over the letter again. ""'So very fond of me!''tis nonsense all. She loves nobody but herself and her brother. Herfriends leading her astray for years! She is quite as likely to have led_them_ astray. They have all, perhaps, been corrupting one another; butif they are so much fonder of her than she is of them, she is the lesslikely to have been hurt, except by their flattery. 'The only woman inthe world whom he could ever think of as a wife.' I firmly believe it.It is an attachment to govern his whole life. Accepted or refused, hisheart is wedded to her for ever. 'The loss of Mary I must consider ascomprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.' Edmund, you do not knowme. The families would never be connected if you did not connectthem! Oh! write, write. Finish it at once. Let there be an end of thissuspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself.""Such sensations, however, were too near akin to resentment to be longguiding Fanny's soliloquies. She was soon more softened and sorrowful.His warm regard, his kind expressions, his confidential treatment,touched her strongly. He was only too good to everybody. It was aletter, in short, which she would not but have had for the world, andwhich could never be valued enough. This was the end of it.Everybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without having much to say,which will include a large proportion of the female world at least, mustfeel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having such a capitalpiece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath,occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it, and will admitthat it must have been very mortifying to her to see it fall to theshare of her thankless son, and treated as concisely as possible at theend of a long letter, instead of having it to spread over the largestpart of a page of her own. For though Lady Bertram rather shone in theepistolary line, having early in her marriage, from the want of otheremployment, and the circumstance of Sir Thomas's being in Parliament,got into the way of making and keeping correspondents, and formed forherself a very creditable, common-place, amplifying style, so that avery little matter was enough for her: she could not do entirely withoutany; she must have something to write about, even to her niece; andbeing so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant's gouty symptoms andMrs. Grant's morning calls, it was very hard upon her to be deprived ofone of the last epistolary uses she could put them to.There was a rich amends, however, preparing for her. Lady Bertram'shour of good luck came. Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund'sletter, Fanny had one from her aunt, beginning thus--""My Dear Fanny,--I take up my pen to communicate some very alarmingintelligence, which I make no doubt will give you much concern"".This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquainther with all the particulars of the Grants' intended journey, for thepresent intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the penfor many days to come, being no less than the dangerous illness of hereldest son, of which they had received notice by express a few hoursbefore.Tom had gone from London with a party of young men to Newmarket, wherea neglected fall and a good deal of drinking had brought on a fever; andwhen the party broke up, being unable to move, had been left by himselfat the house of one of these young men to the comforts of sickness andsolitude, and the attendance only of servants. Instead of being soonwell enough to follow his friends, as he had then hoped, his disorderincreased considerably, and it was not long before he thought so ill ofhimself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatchedto Mansfield.""This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,"" observedher ladyship, after giving the substance of it, ""has agitated usexceedingly, and we cannot prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmedand apprehensive for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fearsmay be very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brotherimmediately, but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me onthis distressing occasion, as it would be too trying for me. We shallgreatly miss Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope hewill find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might beapprehended, and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly,which Sir Thomas proposes should be done, and thinks best on everyaccount, and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able tobear the removal without material inconvenience or injury. As Ihave little doubt of your feeling for us, my dear Fanny, under thesedistressing circumstances, I will write again very soon.""Fanny's feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm andgenuine than her aunt's style of writing. She felt truly for them all.Tom dangerously ill, Edmund gone to attend him, and the sadly smallparty remaining at Mansfield, were cares to shut out every other care,or almost every other. She could just find selfishness enough to wonderwhether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came,but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionateand disinterestedly anxious. Her aunt did not neglect her: she wroteagain and again; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund,and these accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny, in the samediffuse style, and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears, allfollowing and producing each other at haphazard. It was a sort ofplaying at being frightened. The sufferings which Lady Bertram did notsee had little power over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortablyabout agitation, and anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom was actuallyconveyed to Mansfield, and her own eyes had beheld his alteredappearance. Then a letter which she had been previously preparing forFanny was finished in a different style, in the language of real feelingand alarm; then she wrote as she might have spoken. ""He is just come, mydear Fanny, and is taken upstairs; and I am so shocked to see him, thatI do not know what to do. I am sure he has been very ill. Poor Tom! I amquite grieved for him, and very much frightened, and so is Sir Thomas;and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me. But SirThomas hopes he will be better to-morrow, and says we must consider hisjourney.""The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was notsoon over. Tom's extreme impatience to be removed to Mansfield, andexperience those comforts of home and family which had been littlethought of in uninterrupted health, had probably induced his beingconveyed thither too early, as a return of fever came on, and for a weekhe was in a more alarming state than ever. They were all very seriouslyfrightened. Lady Bertram wrote her daily terrors to her niece, whomight now be said to live upon letters, and pass all her time betweensuffering from that of to-day and looking forward to to-morrow's.Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin, her tendernessof heart made her feel that she could not spare him, and the purity ofher principles added yet a keener solicitude, when she considered howlittle useful, how little self-denying his life had (apparently) been.Susan was her only companion and listener on this, as on more commonoccasions. Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise. Nobody elsecould be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family above anhundred miles off; not even Mrs. Price, beyond a brief question or two,if she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand, and now and then thequiet observation of, ""My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal oftrouble.""So long divided and so differently situated, the ties of blood werelittle more than nothing. An attachment, originally as tranquil as theirtempers, was now become a mere name. Mrs. Price did quite as much forLady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price. Three orfour Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny andWilliam, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it; or perhapsmight have caught from Mrs. Norris's lips the cant of its being a veryhappy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price to havethem so well provided for."
Mansfield Park,45,"CHAPTER XLVAt about the week's end from his return to Mansfield, Tom's immediatedanger was over, and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his motherperfectly easy; for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering,helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never thinking beyondwhat she heard, with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint,Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medicalimposition. The fever was subdued; the fever had been his complaint;of course he would soon be well again. Lady Bertram could think nothingless, and Fanny shared her aunt's security, till she received a fewlines from Edmund, written purposely to give her a clearer idea of hisbrother's situation, and acquaint her with the apprehensions whichhe and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to somestrong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the frame on the departureof the fever. They judged it best that Lady Bertram should not beharassed by alarms which, it was to be hoped, would prove unfounded;but there was no reason why Fanny should not know the truth. They wereapprehensive for his lungs.A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroomin a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram's sheets of papercould do. There was hardly any one in the house who might not havedescribed, from personal observation, better than herself; not one whowas not more useful at times to her son. She could do nothing but glidein quietly and look at him; but when able to talk or be talked to, orread to, Edmund was the companion he preferred. His aunt worried him byher cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation orhis voice to the level of irritation and feebleness. Edmund was all inall. Fanny would certainly believe him so at least, and must find thather estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as theattendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother. There was not onlythe debility of recent illness to assist: there was also, as she nowlearnt, nerves much affected, spirits much depressed to calm and raise,and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properlyguided.The family were not consumptive, and she was more inclined to hope thanfear for her cousin, except when she thought of Miss Crawford; but MissCrawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck, and to herselfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the onlyson.Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten. Edmund'sletter had this postscript. ""On the subject of my last, I had actuallybegun a letter when called away by Tom's illness, but I have now changedmy mind, and fear to trust the influence of friends. When Tom is better,I shall go.""Such was the state of Mansfield, and so it continued, with scarcely anychange, till Easter. A line occasionally added by Edmund to hismother's letter was enough for Fanny's information. Tom's amendment wasalarmingly slow.Easter came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most sorrowfullyconsidered, on first learning that she had no chance of leavingPortsmouth till after it. It came, and she had yet heard nothing of herreturn--nothing even of the going to London, which was to precedeher return. Her aunt often expressed a wish for her, but there was nonotice, no message from the uncle on whom all depended. She supposedhe could not yet leave his son, but it was a cruel, a terrible delayto her. The end of April was coming on; it would soon be almost threemonths, instead of two, that she had been absent from them all, and thather days had been passing in a state of penance, which she loved themtoo well to hope they would thoroughly understand; and who could yet saywhen there might be leisure to think of or fetch her?Her eagerness, her impatience, her longings to be with them, were suchas to bring a line or two of Cowper's Tirocinium for ever before her.""With what intense desire she wants her home,"" was continually on hertongue, as the truest description of a yearning which she could notsuppose any schoolboy's bosom to feel more keenly.When she had been coming to Portsmouth, she had loved to call it herhome, had been fond of saying that she was going home; the word hadbeen very dear to her, and so it still was, but it must be applied toMansfield. _That_ was now the home. Portsmouth was Portsmouth; Mansfieldwas home. They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her secretmeditations, and nothing was more consolatory to her than to find heraunt using the same language: ""I cannot but say I much regret your beingfrom home at this distressing time, so very trying to my spirits. Itrust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home solong again,"" were most delightful sentences to her. Still, however, itwas her private regale. Delicacy to her parents made her careful not tobetray such a preference of her uncle's house. It was always: ""When I goback into Northamptonshire, or when I return to Mansfield, I shall doso and so."" For a great while it was so, but at last the longing grewstronger, it overthrew caution, and she found herself talking of whatshe should do when she went home before she was aware. She reproachedherself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards her father and mother.She need not have been uneasy. There was no sign of displeasure, or evenof hearing her. They were perfectly free from any jealousy of Mansfield.She was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there.It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring. She had notknown before what pleasures she _had_ to lose in passing March and Aprilin a town. She had not known before how much the beginnings and progressof vegetation had delighted her. What animation, both of body and mind,she had derived from watching the advance of that season which cannot,in spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely, and seeing its increasingbeauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest divisions of heraunt's garden, to the opening of leaves of her uncle's plantations, andthe glory of his woods. To be losing such pleasures was no trifle; tobe losing them, because she was in the midst of closeness and noise,to have confinement, bad air, bad smells, substituted for liberty,freshness, fragrance, and verdure, was infinitely worse: but even theseincitements to regret were feeble, compared with what arose from theconviction of being missed by her best friends, and the longing to beuseful to those who were wanting her!Could she have been at home, she might have been of service to everycreature in the house. She felt that she must have been of use to all.To all she must have saved some trouble of head or hand; and were itonly in supporting the spirits of her aunt Bertram, keeping her fromthe evil of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless, officiouscompanion, too apt to be heightening danger in order to enhance her ownimportance, her being there would have been a general good. She loved tofancy how she could have read to her aunt, how she could have talked toher, and tried at once to make her feel the blessing of what was, andprepare her mind for what might be; and how many walks up and downstairs she might have saved her, and how many messages she might havecarried.It astonished her that Tom's sisters could be satisfied with remainingin London at such a time, through an illness which had now, underdifferent degrees of danger, lasted several weeks. _They_ might returnto Mansfield when they chose; travelling could be no difficulty to_them_, and she could not comprehend how both could still keep away.If Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations, Julia wascertainly able to quit London whenever she chose. It appeared from oneof her aunt's letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted, butthis was all. It was evident that she would rather remain where she was.Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at warwith all respectable attachments. She saw the proof of it in MissCrawford, as well as in her cousins; _her_ attachment to Edmund had beenrespectable, the most respectable part of her character; her friendshipfor herself had at least been blameless. Where was either sentiment now?It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her, that she hadsome reason to think lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelton. It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or ofher other connexions in town, except through Mansfield, and she wasbeginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr. Crawford hadgone into Norfolk again or not till they met, and might never hear fromhis sister any more this spring, when the following letter was receivedto revive old and create some new sensations--""Forgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my long silence, andbehave as if you could forgive me directly. This is my modest requestand expectation, for you are so good, that I depend upon being treatedbetter than I deserve, and I write now to beg an immediate answer. Iwant to know the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you, no doubt,are perfectly able to give it. One should be a brute not to feel for thedistress they are in; and from what I hear, poor Mr. Bertram has a badchance of ultimate recovery. I thought little of his illness at first.I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with, and tomake a fuss himself in any trifling disorder, and was chiefly concernedfor those who had to nurse him; but now it is confidently asserted thathe is really in a decline, that the symptoms are most alarming, and thatpart of the family, at least, are aware of it. If it be so, I am sureyou must be included in that part, that discerning part, and thereforeentreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed. I neednot say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake, butthe report is so prevalent that I confess I cannot help trembling. Tohave such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his days is mostmelancholy. Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully. I really am quiteagitated on the subject. Fanny, Fanny, I see you smile and look cunning,but, upon my honour, I never bribed a physician in my life. Poor youngman! If he is to die, there will be _two_ poor young men less in theworld; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one,that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving ofthem. It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas, but the evil ofa few days may be blotted out in part. Varnish and gilding hide manystains. It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name. With realaffection, Fanny, like mine, more might be overlooked. Write to me byreturn of post, judge of my anxiety, and do not trifle with it. Tell methe real truth, as you have it from the fountainhead. And now, donot trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own.Believe me, they are not only natural, they are philanthropic andvirtuous. I put it to your conscience, whether 'Sir Edmund' would not domore good with all the Bertram property than any other possible 'Sir.'Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you, but you arenow the only one I can apply to for the truth, his sisters not beingwithin my reach. Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmersat Twickenham (as to be sure you know), and is not yet returned; andJulia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square, but I forgettheir name and street. Could I immediately apply to either, however, Ishould still prefer you, because it strikes me that they have all alongbeen so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up, as to shut theireyes to the truth. I suppose Mrs. R.'s Easter holidays will not lastmuch longer; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her. The Aylmersare pleasant people; and her husband away, she can have nothing butenjoyment. I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down toBath, to fetch his mother; but how will she and the dowager agree in onehouse? Henry is not at hand, so I have nothing to say from him. Do notyou think Edmund would have been in town again long ago, but for thisillness?--Yours ever, Mary.""""I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in, but hebrings no intelligence to prevent my sending it. Mrs. R. knows a declineis apprehended; he saw her this morning: she returns to Wimpole Streetto-day; the old lady is come. Now do not make yourself uneasy with anyqueer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond. Hedoes it every spring. Be assured he cares for nobody but you. At thisvery moment he is wild to see you, and occupied only in contriving themeans for doing so, and for making his pleasure conduce to yours. Inproof, he repeats, and more eagerly, what he said at Portsmouth aboutour conveying you home, and I join him in it with all my soul. DearFanny, write directly, and tell us to come. It will do us all good.He and I can go to the Parsonage, you know, and be no trouble to ourfriends at Mansfield Park. It would really be gratifying to see themall again, and a little addition of society might be of infinite use tothem; and as to yourself, you must feel yourself to be so wanted there,that you cannot in conscience--conscientious as you are--keep away, whenyou have the means of returning. I have not time or patience to givehalf Henry's messages; be satisfied that the spirit of each and everyone is unalterable affection.""Fanny's disgust at the greater part of this letter, with her extremereluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin Edmund together,would have made her (as she felt) incapable of judging impartiallywhether the concluding offer might be accepted or not. To herself,individually, it was most tempting. To be finding herself, perhapswithin three days, transported to Mansfield, was an image of thegreatest felicity, but it would have been a material drawback to beowing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct, at thepresent moment, she saw so much to condemn: the sister's feelings,the brother's conduct, _her_ cold-hearted ambition, _his_ thoughtlessvanity. To have him still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps, of Mrs.Rushworth! She was mortified. She had thought better of him. Happily,however, she was not left to weigh and decide between oppositeinclinations and doubtful notions of right; there was no occasion todetermine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not. Shehad a rule to apply to, which settled everything. Her awe of her uncle,and her dread of taking a liberty with him, made it instantly plain toher what she had to do. She must absolutely decline the proposal. If hewanted, he would send for her; and even to offer an early return wasa presumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify. Shethanked Miss Crawford, but gave a decided negative. ""Her uncle,she understood, meant to fetch her; and as her cousin's illness hadcontinued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary,she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present, and that sheshould be felt an encumbrance.""Her representation of her cousin's state at this time was exactlyaccording to her own belief of it, and such as she supposed would conveyto the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she waswishing for. Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it seemed,under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she suspected, was allthe conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himselfupon. She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money."
Mansfield Park,46,"CHAPTER XLVIAs Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying a realdisappointment, she was rather in expectation, from her knowledge ofMiss Crawford's temper, of being urged again; and though no secondletter arrived for the space of a week, she had still the same feelingwhen it did come.On receiving it, she could instantly decide on its containing littlewriting, and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of hasteand business. Its object was unquestionable; and two moments were enoughto start the probability of its being merely to give her notice thatthey should be in Portsmouth that very day, and to throw her into allthe agitation of doubting what she ought to do in such a case. If twomoments, however, can surround with difficulties, a third can dispersethem; and before she had opened the letter, the possibility of Mr. andMiss Crawford's having applied to her uncle and obtained his permissionwas giving her ease. This was the letter--""A most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me, and I write,dear Fanny, to warn you against giving the least credit to it, should itspread into the country. Depend upon it, there is some mistake, and thata day or two will clear it up; at any rate, that Henry is blameless, andin spite of a moment's _etourderie_, thinks of nobody but you. Say not aword of it; hear nothing, surmise nothing, whisper nothing till Iwrite again. I am sure it will be all hushed up, and nothing proved butRushworth's folly. If they are gone, I would lay my life they are onlygone to Mansfield Park, and Julia with them. But why would not you letus come for you? I wish you may not repent it.--Yours, etc.""Fanny stood aghast. As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour had reachedher, it was impossible for her to understand much of this strangeletter. She could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Streetand Mr. Crawford, and only conjecture that something very imprudent hadjust occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world, and toexcite her jealousy, in Miss Crawford's apprehension, if she heard it.Miss Crawford need not be alarmed for her. She was only sorry for theparties concerned and for Mansfield, if the report should spread so far;but she hoped it might not. If the Rushworths were gone themselves toMansfield, as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said, it wasnot likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them, or atleast should make any impression.As to Mr. Crawford, she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his owndisposition, convince him that he was not capable of being steadilyattached to any one woman in the world, and shame him from persistingany longer in addressing herself.It was very strange! She had begun to think he really loved her, and tofancy his affection for her something more than common; and his sisterstill said that he cared for nobody else. Yet there must have been somemarked display of attentions to her cousin, there must have been somestrong indiscretion, since her correspondent was not of a sort to regarda slight one.Very uncomfortable she was, and must continue, till she heard fromMiss Crawford again. It was impossible to banish the letter from herthoughts, and she could not relieve herself by speaking of it to anyhuman being. Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so muchwarmth; she might have trusted to her sense of what was due to hercousin.The next day came and brought no second letter. Fanny was disappointed.She could still think of little else all the morning; but, when herfather came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual, shewas so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel thatthe subject was for a moment out of her head.She was deep in other musing. The remembrance of her first evening inthat room, of her father and his newspaper, came across her. No candlewas now wanted. The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon. Shefelt that she had, indeed, been three months there; and the sun's raysfalling strongly into the parlour, instead of cheering, made her stillmore melancholy, for sunshine appeared to her a totally differentthing in a town and in the country. Here, its power was only a glare:a stifling, sickly glare, serving but to bring forward stains and dirtthat might otherwise have slept. There was neither health nor gaiety insunshine in a town. She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloudof moving dust, and her eyes could only wander from the walls, marked byher father's head, to the table cut and notched by her brothers, wherestood the tea-board never thoroughly cleaned, the cups and saucers wipedin streaks, the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue, and thebread and butter growing every minute more greasy than even Rebecca'shands had first produced it. Her father read his newspaper, and hermother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual, while the tea wasin preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it; and Fanny was firstroused by his calling out to her, after humphing and considering overa particular paragraph: ""What's the name of your great cousins in town,Fan?""A moment's recollection enabled her to say, ""Rushworth, sir.""""And don't they live in Wimpole Street?""""Yes, sir.""""Then, there's the devil to pay among them, that's all! There"" (holdingout the paper to her); ""much good may such fine relations do you. Idon't know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters; he may be too muchof the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less. But,by G--! if she belonged to _me_, I'd give her the rope's end as long asI could stand over her. A little flogging for man and woman too would bethe best way of preventing such things.""Fanny read to herself that ""it was with infinite concern the newspaperhad to announce to the world a matrimonial _fracas_ in the family ofMr. R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not longbeen enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to becomeso brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted herhusband's roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr. C.,the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known evento the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone.""""It is a mistake, sir,"" said Fanny instantly; ""it must be a mistake, itcannot be true; it must mean some other people.""She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she spoke witha resolution which sprung from despair, for she spoke what she did not,could not believe herself. It had been the shock of conviction as sheread. The truth rushed on her; and how she could have spoken at all,how she could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder toherself.Mr. Price cared too little about the report to make her much answer.""It might be all a lie,"" he acknowledged; ""but so many fine ladies weregoing to the devil nowadays that way, that there was no answering foranybody.""""Indeed, I hope it is not true,"" said Mrs. Price plaintively; ""it wouldbe so very shocking! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet,I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times; have not I, Betsey? Andit would not be ten minutes' work.""The horror of a mind like Fanny's, as it received the conviction of suchguilt, and began to take in some part of the misery that must ensue, canhardly be described. At first, it was a sort of stupefaction; but everymoment was quickening her perception of the horrible evil. She could notdoubt, she dared not indulge a hope, of the paragraph being false. MissCrawford's letter, which she had read so often as to make every lineher own, was in frightful conformity with it. Her eager defence of herbrother, her hope of its being _hushed_ _up_, her evident agitation,were all of a piece with something very bad; and if there was a womanof character in existence, who could treat as a trifle this sin of thefirst magnitude, who would try to gloss it over, and desire to have itunpunished, she could believe Miss Crawford to be the woman! Now shecould see her own mistake as to _who_ were gone, or _said_ to begone. It was not Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth; it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr.Crawford.Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before. There was nopossibility of rest. The evening passed without a pause of misery, thenight was totally sleepless. She passed only from feelings of sicknessto shudderings of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold. The eventwas so shocking, that there were moments even when her heart revoltedfrom it as impossible: when she thought it could not be. A woman marriedonly six months ago; a man professing himself devoted, even _engaged_ toanother; that other her near relation; the whole family, both familiesconnected as they were by tie upon tie; all friends, all intimatetogether! It was too horrible a confusion of guilt, too gross acomplication of evil, for human nature, not in a state of utterbarbarism, to be capable of! yet her judgment told her it was so._His_ unsettled affections, wavering with his vanity, _Maria's_decided attachment, and no sufficient principle on either side, gave itpossibility: Miss Crawford's letter stampt it a fact.What would be the consequence? Whom would it not injure? Whose viewsmight it not affect? Whose peace would it not cut up for ever? MissCrawford, herself, Edmund; but it was dangerous, perhaps, to treadsuch ground. She confined herself, or tried to confine herself, to thesimple, indubitable family misery which must envelop all, if it wereindeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure. The mother'ssufferings, the father's; there she paused. Julia's, Tom's, Edmund's;there a yet longer pause. They were the two on whom it would fall mosthorribly. Sir Thomas's parental solicitude and high sense of honour anddecorum, Edmund's upright principles, unsuspicious temper, and genuinestrength of feeling, made her think it scarcely possible for them tosupport life and reason under such disgrace; and it appeared to herthat, as far as this world alone was concerned, the greatest blessing toevery one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be instant annihilation.Nothing happened the next day, or the next, to weaken her terrors. Twoposts came in, and brought no refutation, public or private. There wasno second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford; there wasno intelligence from Mansfield, though it was now full time for herto hear again from her aunt. This was an evil omen. She had, indeed,scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her mind, and was reduced to solow and wan and trembling a condition, as no mother, not unkind, exceptMrs. Price could have overlooked, when the third day did bring thesickening knock, and a letter was again put into her hands. It bore theLondon postmark, and came from Edmund.""Dear Fanny,--You know our present wretchedness. May God support youunder your share! We have been here two days, but there is nothing tobe done. They cannot be traced. You may not have heard of the lastblow--Julia's elopement; she is gone to Scotland with Yates. She leftLondon a few hours before we entered it. At any other time this wouldhave been felt dreadfully. Now it seems nothing; yet it is an heavyaggravation. My father is not overpowered. More cannot be hoped. He isstill able to think and act; and I write, by his desire, to propose yourreturning home. He is anxious to get you there for my mother's sake. Ishall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this, and hope tofind you ready to set off for Mansfield. My father wishes you to inviteSusan to go with you for a few months. Settle it as you like; say whatis proper; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness atsuch a moment! Do justice to his meaning, however I may confuse it. Youmay imagine something of my present state. There is no end of the evillet loose upon us. You will see me early by the mail.--Yours, etc.""Never had Fanny more wanted a cordial. Never had she felt such a oneas this letter contained. To-morrow! to leave Portsmouth to-morrow!She was, she felt she was, in the greatest danger of being exquisitelyhappy, while so many were miserable. The evil which brought such goodto her! She dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it. To begoing so soon, sent for so kindly, sent for as a comfort, and with leaveto take Susan, was altogether such a combination of blessings as set herheart in a glow, and for a time seemed to distance every pain, andmake her incapable of suitably sharing the distress even of thosewhose distress she thought of most. Julia's elopement could affect hercomparatively but little; she was amazed and shocked; but it could notoccupy her, could not dwell on her mind. She was obliged to call herselfto think of it, and acknowledge it to be terrible and grievous, or itwas escaping her, in the midst of all the agitating pressing joyfulcares attending this summons to herself.There is nothing like employment, active indispensable employment, forrelieving sorrow. Employment, even melancholy, may dispel melancholy,and her occupations were hopeful. She had so much to do, that not eventhe horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth--now fixed to the last point ofcertainty could affect her as it had done before. She had not time tobe miserable. Within twenty-four hours she was hoping to be gone; herfather and mother must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything gotready. Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough. Thehappiness she was imparting, too, happiness very little alloyed by theblack communication which must briefly precede it--the joyful consentof her father and mother to Susan's going with her--the generalsatisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded, and theecstasy of Susan herself, was all serving to support her spirits.The affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family. Mrs. Pricetalked of her poor sister for a few minutes, but how to find anything tohold Susan's clothes, because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoiltthem, was much more in her thoughts: and as for Susan, now unexpectedlygratified in the first wish of her heart, and knowing nothing personallyof those who had sinned, or of those who were sorrowing--if she couldhelp rejoicing from beginning to end, it was as much as ought to beexpected from human virtue at fourteen.As nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price, or the goodoffices of Rebecca, everything was rationally and duly accomplished,and the girls were ready for the morrow. The advantage of much sleepto prepare them for their journey was impossible. The cousin who wastravelling towards them could hardly have less than visited theiragitated spirits--one all happiness, the other all varying andindescribable perturbation.By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house. The girls heard hisentrance from above, and Fanny went down. The idea of immediately seeinghim, with the knowledge of what he must be suffering, brought back allher own first feelings. He so near her, and in misery. She was ready tosink as she entered the parlour. He was alone, and met her instantly;and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words, justarticulate, ""My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort now!"" She couldsay nothing; nor for some minutes could he say more.He turned away to recover himself, and when he spoke again, though hisvoice still faltered, his manner shewed the wish of self-command, andthe resolution of avoiding any farther allusion. ""Have you breakfasted?When shall you be ready? Does Susan go?"" were questions following eachother rapidly. His great object was to be off as soon as possible. WhenMansfield was considered, time was precious; and the state of his ownmind made him find relief only in motion. It was settled that he shouldorder the carriage to the door in half an hour. Fanny answered for theirhaving breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour. He had alreadyate, and declined staying for their meal. He would walk round theramparts, and join them with the carriage. He was gone again; glad toget away even from Fanny.He looked very ill; evidently suffering under violent emotions, which hewas determined to suppress. She knew it must be so, but it was terribleto her.The carriage came; and he entered the house again at the samemoment, just in time to spend a few minutes with the family, and be awitness--but that he saw nothing--of the tranquil manner in which thedaughters were parted with, and just in time to prevent their sittingdown to the breakfast-table, which, by dint of much unusual activity,was quite and completely ready as the carriage drove from the door.Fanny's last meal in her father's house was in character with her first:she was dismissed from it as hospitably as she had been welcomed.How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the barriersof Portsmouth, and how Susan's face wore its broadest smiles, may beeasily conceived. Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her bonnet,those smiles were unseen.The journey was likely to be a silent one. Edmund's deep sighs oftenreached Fanny. Had he been alone with her, his heart must have openedin spite of every resolution; but Susan's presence drove him quite intohimself, and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never belong supported.Fanny watched him with never-failing solicitude, and sometimes catchinghis eye, revived an affectionate smile, which comforted her; but thefirst day's journey passed without her hearing a word from him on thesubjects that were weighing him down. The next morning produced alittle more. Just before their setting out from Oxford, while Susan wasstationed at a window, in eager observation of the departure of alarge family from the inn, the other two were standing by the fire; andEdmund, particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny's looks, and fromhis ignorance of the daily evils of her father's house, attributing anundue share of the change, attributing _all_ to the recent event, tookher hand, and said in a low, but very expressive tone, ""No wonder--youmust feel it--you must suffer. How a man who had once loved, coulddesert you! But _yours_--your regard was new compared with----Fanny,think of _me_!""The first division of their journey occupied a long day, and broughtthem, almost knocked up, to Oxford; but the second was over at a muchearlier hour. They were in the environs of Mansfield long before theusual dinner-time, and as they approached the beloved place, the heartsof both sisters sank a little. Fanny began to dread the meeting with heraunts and Tom, under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feelwith some anxiety, that all her best manners, all her lately acquiredknowledge of what was practised here, was on the point of being calledinto action. Visions of good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and newgentilities, were before her; and she was meditating much upon silverforks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had been everywhere awake tothe difference of the country since February; but when they entered thePark her perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort. It wasthree months, full three months, since her quitting it, and thechange was from winter to summer. Her eye fell everywhere on lawnsand plantations of the freshest green; and the trees, though not fullyclothed, were in that delightful state when farther beauty is known tobe at hand, and when, while much is actually given to the sight, moreyet remains for the imagination. Her enjoyment, however, was for herselfalone. Edmund could not share it. She looked at him, but he was leaningback, sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with eyes closed, as if theview of cheerfulness oppressed him, and the lovely scenes of home mustbe shut out.It made her melancholy again; and the knowledge of what must be enduringthere, invested even the house, modern, airy, and well situated as itwas, with a melancholy aspect.By one of the suffering party within they were expected with suchimpatience as she had never known before. Fanny had scarcely passed thesolemn-looking servants, when Lady Bertram came from the drawing-roomto meet her; came with no indolent step; and falling on her neck, said,""Dear Fanny! now I shall be comfortable."""
Mansfield Park,47,"CHAPTER XLVIIIt had been a miserable party, each of the three believing themselvesmost miserable. Mrs. Norris, however, as most attached to Maria, wasreally the greatest sufferer. Maria was her first favourite, the dearestof all; the match had been her own contriving, as she had been wont withsuch pride of heart to feel and say, and this conclusion of it almostoverpowered her.She was an altered creature, quieted, stupefied, indifferent toeverything that passed. The being left with her sister and nephew, andall the house under her care, had been an advantage entirely thrownaway; she had been unable to direct or dictate, or even fancy herselfuseful. When really touched by affliction, her active powers had beenall benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her thesmallest support or attempt at support. She had done no more for themthan they had done for each other. They had been all solitary, helpless,and forlorn alike; and now the arrival of the others only establishedher superiority in wretchedness. Her companions were relieved, but therewas no good for _her_. Edmund was almost as welcome to his brotheras Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having comfort fromeither, was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom, inthe blindness of her anger, she could have charged as the daemon of thepiece. Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened.Susan too was a grievance. She had not spirits to notice her in morethan a few repulsive looks, but she felt her as a spy, and an intruder,and an indigent niece, and everything most odious. By her other aunt,Susan was received with quiet kindness. Lady Bertram could not give hermuch time, or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny's sister, to havea claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susanwas more than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing butill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so providedwith happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape frommany certain evils, that she could have stood against a great deal moreindifference than she met with from the others.She was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted with thehouse and grounds as she could, and spent her days very happily in sodoing, while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shutup, or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them, atthis time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying to bury his ownfeelings in exertions for the relief of his brother's, and Fanny devotedto her aunt Bertram, returning to every former office with more thanformer zeal, and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemedso much to want her.To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament, was allLady Bertram's consolation. To be listened to and borne with, and hearthe voice of kindness and sympathy in return, was everything that couldbe done for her. To be otherwise comforted was out of the question. Thecase admitted of no comfort. Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but,guided by Sir Thomas, she thought justly on all important points; andshe saw, therefore, in all its enormity, what had happened, and neitherendeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her, to think littleof guilt and infamy.Her affections were not acute, nor was her mind tenacious. After a time,Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects,and revive some interest in the usual occupations; but whenever LadyBertram _was_ fixed on the event, she could see it only in one light, ascomprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace never to be wipedoff.Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired. Heraunt was no very methodical narrator, but with the help of some lettersto and from Sir Thomas, and what she already knew herself, and couldreasonably combine, she was soon able to understand quite as much as shewished of the circumstances attending the story.Mrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, witha family whom she had just grown intimate with: a family of lively,agreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for to_their_ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times. His havingbeen in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew. Mr. Rushworth hadbeen gone at this time to Bath, to pass a few days with his mother, andbring her back to town, and Maria was with these friends without anyrestraint, without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Streettwo or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas;a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attributeto some view of convenience on Mr. Yates's account. Very soon after theRushworths' return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received a letterfrom an old and most particular friend in London, who hearing andwitnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter, wrote to recommendSir Thomas's coming to London himself, and using his influence with hisdaughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her tounpleasant remarks, and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy.Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without communicatingits contents to any creature at Mansfield, when it was followed byanother, sent express from the same friend, to break to him the almostdesperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people.Mrs. Rushworth had left her husband's house: Mr. Rushworth had beenin great anger and distress to _him_ (Mr. Harding) for his advice; Mr.Harding feared there had been _at_ _least_ very flagrant indiscretion.The maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth, senior, threatened alarmingly. Hewas doing all in his power to quiet everything, with the hope of Mrs.Rushworth's return, but was so much counteracted in Wimpole Street bythe influence of Mr. Rushworth's mother, that the worst consequencesmight be apprehended.This dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of thefamily. Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him, and the others hadbeen left in a state of wretchedness, inferior only to what followedthe receipt of the next letters from London. Everything was by that timepublic beyond a hope. The servant of Mrs. Rushworth, the mother, hadexposure in her power, and supported by her mistress, was not to besilenced. The two ladies, even in the short time they had beentogether, had disagreed; and the bitterness of the elder against herdaughter-in-law might perhaps arise almost as much from the personaldisrespect with which she had herself been treated as from sensibilityfor her son.However that might be, she was unmanageable. But had she been lessobstinate, or of less weight with her son, who was always guided by thelast speaker, by the person who could get hold of and shut him up, thecase would still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not appearagain, and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealedsomewhere with Mr. Crawford, who had quitted his uncle's house, as for ajourney, on the very day of her absenting herself.Sir Thomas, however, remained yet a little longer in town, in the hopeof discovering and snatching her from farther vice, though all was loston the side of character._His_ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of. There was butone of his children who was not at this time a source of misery tohim. Tom's complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of hissister's conduct, and his recovery so much thrown back by it, that evenLady Bertram had been struck by the difference, and all her alarms wereregularly sent off to her husband; and Julia's elopement, the additionalblow which had met him on his arrival in London, though its force hadbeen deadened at the moment, must, she knew, be sorely felt. She sawthat it was. His letters expressed how much he deplored it. Under anycircumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance; but to have itso clandestinely formed, and such a period chosen for its completion,placed Julia's feelings in a most unfavourable light, and severelyaggravated the folly of her choice. He called it a bad thing, done inthe worst manner, and at the worst time; and though Julia was yet asmore pardonable than Maria as folly than vice, he could not butregard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of aconclusion hereafter like her sister's. Such was his opinion of the setinto which she had thrown herself.Fanny felt for him most acutely. He could have no comfort but in Edmund.Every other child must be racking his heart. His displeasure againstherself she trusted, reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris, would nowbe done away. _She_ should be justified. Mr. Crawford would have fullyacquitted her conduct in refusing him; but this, though most materialto herself, would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas. Her uncle'sdispleasure was terrible to her; but what could her justification or hergratitude and attachment do for him? His stay must be on Edmund alone.She was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave his father nopresent pain. It was of a much less poignant nature than what the othersexcited; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very deeplyinvolved in the offence of his sister and friend; cut off by it, ashe must be, from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubtedattachment and strong probability of success; and who, in everything butthis despicable brother, would have been so eligible a connexion. He wasaware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf, in additionto all the rest, when they were in town: he had seen or conjecturedhis feelings; and, having reason to think that one interview with MissCrawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived only increaseddistress, had been as anxious on that account as on others to get himout of town, and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt, witha view to his relief and benefit, no less than theirs. Fanny was not inthe secret of her uncle's feelings, Sir Thomas not in the secret of MissCrawford's character. Had he been privy to her conversation with hisson, he would not have wished her to belong to him, though her twentythousand pounds had been forty.That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admitof a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew that he felt the same, herown conviction was insufficient. She thought he did, but she wanted tobe assured of it. If he would now speak to her with the unreserve whichhad sometimes been too much for her before, it would be most consoling;but _that_ she found was not to be. She seldom saw him: never alone. Heprobably avoided being alone with her. What was to be inferred? Thathis judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share of thisfamily affliction, but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject ofthe slightest communication. This must be his state. He yielded, but itwas with agonies which did not admit of speech. Long, long would it beere Miss Crawford's name passed his lips again, or she could hope for arenewal of such confidential intercourse as had been.It _was_ long. They reached Mansfield on Thursday, and it was not tillSunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject. Sittingwith her on Sunday evening--a wet Sunday evening--the very time ofall others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must be opened, andeverything told; no one else in the room, except his mother, who,after hearing an affecting sermon, had cried herself to sleep, it wasimpossible not to speak; and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly tobe traced as to what came first, and the usual declaration that if shewould listen to him for a few minutes, he should be very brief, andcertainly never tax her kindness in the same way again; she need notfear a repetition; it would be a subject prohibited entirely: he enteredupon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the firstinterest to himself, to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quiteconvinced.How Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern, what pain and whatdelight, how the agitation of his voice was watched, and how carefullyher own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined. Theopening was alarming. He had seen Miss Crawford. He had been invited tosee her. He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call;and regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interviewof friendship, and investing her with all the feelings of shame andwretchedness which Crawford's sister ought to have known, he had gone toher in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for afew moments impossible to Fanny's fears that it should be the last. Butas he proceeded in his story, these fears were over. She had met him,he said, with a serious--certainly a serious--even an agitated air;but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she hadintroduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him. ""'Iheard you were in town,' said she; 'I wanted to see you. Let us talkover this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?'I could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She felt reproved.Sometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she thenadded, 'I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister's expense.' Soshe began, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to berepeated to you. I cannot recall all her words. I would not dwell uponthem if I could. Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of each.She reprobated her brother's folly in being drawn on by a woman whom hehad never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman he adored; butstill more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a situation,plunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being really lovedby a man who had long ago made his indifference clear. Guess what I musthave felt. To hear the woman whom--no harsher name than folly given!So voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass it! No reluctance, nohorror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest loathings? This is what theworld does. For where, Fanny, shall we find a woman whom nature had sorichly endowed? Spoilt, spoilt!""After a little reflection, he went on with a sort of desperate calmness.""I will tell you everything, and then have done for ever. She saw itonly as folly, and that folly stamped only by exposure. The want ofcommon discretion, of caution: his going down to Richmond for the wholetime of her being at Twickenham; her putting herself in the power ofa servant; it was the detection, in short--oh, Fanny! it was thedetection, not the offence, which she reprobated. It was the imprudencewhich had brought things to extremity, and obliged her brother to giveup every dearer plan in order to fly with her.""He stopt. ""And what,"" said Fanny (believing herself required to speak),""what could you say?""""Nothing, nothing to be understood. I was like a man stunned. Shewent on, began to talk of you; yes, then she began to talk of you,regretting, as well she might, the loss of such a--. There she spokevery rationally. But she has always done justice to you. 'He has thrownaway,' said she, 'such a woman as he will never see again. She wouldhave fixed him; she would have made him happy for ever.' My dearestFanny, I am giving you, I hope, more pleasure than pain by thisretrospect of what might have been--but what never can be now. You donot wish me to be silent? If you do, give me but a look, a word, and Ihave done.""No look or word was given.""Thank God,"" said he. ""We were all disposed to wonder, but it seems tohave been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart whichknew no guile should not suffer. She spoke of you with high praise andwarm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for inthe midst of it she could exclaim, 'Why would not she have him? It isall her fault. Simple girl! I shall never forgive her. Had she acceptedhim as she ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage, andHenry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object.He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again.It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation, in yearlymeetings at Sotherton and Everingham.' Could you have believed itpossible? But the charm is broken. My eyes are opened.""""Cruel!"" said Fanny, ""quite cruel. At such a moment to give way togaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty.""""Cruelty, do you call it? We differ there. No, hers is not a cruelnature. I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings. The evillies yet deeper: in her total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there beingsuch feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her totreat the subject as she did. She was speaking only as she had been usedto hear others speak, as she imagined everybody else would speak. Hersare not faults of temper. She would not voluntarily give unnecessarypain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot but thinkthat for me, for my feelings, she would--Hers are faults of principle,Fanny; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind. Perhaps itis best for me, since it leaves me so little to regret. Not so, however.Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her, ratherthan have to think of her as I do. I told her so.""""Did you?""""Yes; when I left her I told her so.""""How long were you together?""""Five-and-twenty minutes. Well, she went on to say that what remainednow to be done was to bring about a marriage between them. She spoke ofit, Fanny, with a steadier voice than I can."" He was obliged to pausemore than once as he continued. ""'We must persuade Henry to marryher,' said she; 'and what with honour, and the certainty of having shuthimself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it. Fanny he mustgive up. I do not think that even _he_ could now hope to succeed withone of her stamp, and therefore I hope we may find no insuperabledifficulty. My influence, which is not small shall all go that way; andwhen once married, and properly supported by her own family, people ofrespectability as they are, she may recover her footing in society to acertain degree. In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted,but with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be thosewho will be glad of her acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, moreliberality and candour on those points than formerly. What I adviseis, that your father be quiet. Do not let him injure his own cause byinterference. Persuade him to let things take their course. If by anyofficious exertions of his, she is induced to leave Henry's protection,there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remainwith him. I know how he is likely to be influenced. Let Sir Thomas trustto his honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he get hisdaughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.'""After repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watchinghim with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that thesubject had been entered on at all. It was long before he could speakagain. At last, ""Now, Fanny,"" said he, ""I shall soon have done. I havetold you the substance of all that she said. As soon as I could speak,I replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state ofmind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to makeme suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almostevery sentence. That though I had, in the course of our acquaintance,been often sensible of some difference in our opinions, on points,too, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to conceive thedifference could be such as she had now proved it. That the manner inwhich she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and mysister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say),but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself, giving it everyreproach but the right; considering its ill consequences only as theywere to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence inwrong; and last of all, and above all, recommending to us a compliance,a compromise, an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin, on thechance of a marriage which, thinking as I now thought of her brother,should rather be prevented than sought; all this together mostgrievously convinced me that I had never understood her before, andthat, as far as related to mind, it had been the creature of my ownimagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been too apt to dwell onfor many months past. That, perhaps, it was best for me; I had less toregret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings, hopes which must, at anyrate, have been torn from me now. And yet, that I must and would confessthat, could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before,I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting, for thesake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem. This iswhat I said, the purport of it; but, as you may imagine, not spokenso collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you. She wasastonished, exceedingly astonished--more than astonished. I saw herchange countenance. She turned extremely red. I imagined I saw amixture of many feelings: a great, though short struggle; half a wish ofyielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but habit, habit carriedit. She would have laughed if she could. It was a sort of laugh, as sheanswered, 'A pretty good lecture, upon my word. Was it part of your lastsermon? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield andThornton Lacey; and when I hear of you next, it may be as a celebratedpreacher in some great society of Methodists, or as a missionary intoforeign parts.' She tried to speak carelessly, but she was not socareless as she wanted to appear. I only said in reply, that from myheart I wished her well, and earnestly hoped that she might soon learnto think more justly, and not owe the most valuable knowledge we couldany of us acquire, the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty, to thelessons of affliction, and immediately left the room. I had gone a fewsteps, Fanny, when I heard the door open behind me. 'Mr. Bertram,' saidshe. I looked back. 'Mr. Bertram,' said she, with a smile; but it wasa smile ill-suited to the conversation that had passed, a saucy playfulsmile, seeming to invite in order to subdue me; at least it appeared soto me. I resisted; it was the impulse of the moment to resist, and stillwalked on. I have since, sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I didnot go back, but I know I was right, and such has been the end of ouracquaintance. And what an acquaintance has it been! How have I beendeceived! Equally in brother and sister deceived! I thank you for yourpatience, Fanny. This has been the greatest relief, and now we will havedone.""And such was Fanny's dependence on his words, that for five minutesshe thought they _had_ done. Then, however, it all came on again, orsomething very like it, and nothing less than Lady Bertram's rousingthoroughly up could really close such a conversation. Till thathappened, they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she hadattached him, and how delightful nature had made her, and how excellentshe would have been, had she fallen into good hands earlier. Fanny, nowat liberty to speak openly, felt more than justified in adding tohis knowledge of her real character, by some hint of what share hisbrother's state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for acomplete reconciliation. This was not an agreeable intimation. Natureresisted it for a while. It would have been a vast deal pleasanter tohave had her more disinterested in her attachment; but his vanity wasnot of a strength to fight long against reason. He submitted to believethat Tom's illness had influenced her, only reserving for himself thisconsoling thought, that considering the many counteractions of opposinghabits, she had certainly been _more_ attached to him than could havebeen expected, and for his sake been more near doing right. Fannythought exactly the same; and they were also quite agreed in theiropinion of the lasting effect, the indelible impression, which sucha disappointment must make on his mind. Time would undoubtedly abatesomewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a sort of thing which henever could get entirely the better of; and as to his ever meeting withany other woman who could--it was too impossible to be named but withindignation. Fanny's friendship was all that he had to cling to."
Mansfield Park,48,"CHAPTER XLVIIILet other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjectsas soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in faultthemselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.My Fanny, indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction of knowing,must have been happy in spite of everything. She must have been a happycreature in spite of all that she felt, or thought she felt, for thedistress of those around her. She had sources of delight that must forcetheir way. She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was useful, she wasbeloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford; and when Sir Thomas came backshe had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state ofspirits, of his perfect approbation and increased regard; and happy asall this must make her, she would still have been happy without any ofit, for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford.It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself. He was sufferingfrom disappointment and regret, grieving over what was, and wishing forwhat could never be. She knew it was so, and was sorry; but it was witha sorrow so founded on satisfaction, so tending to ease, and so much inharmony with every dearest sensation, that there are few who might nothave been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it.Sir Thomas, poor Sir Thomas, a parent, and conscious of errors in hisown conduct as a parent, was the longest to suffer. He felt that heought not to have allowed the marriage; that his daughter's sentimentshad been sufficiently known to him to render him culpable in authorisingit; that in so doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient, andbeen governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom. These werereflections that required some time to soften; but time will do almosteverything; and though little comfort arose on Mrs. Rushworth's side forthe misery she had occasioned, comfort was to be found greater thanhe had supposed in his other children. Julia's match became a lessdesperate business than he had considered it at first. She was humble,and wishing to be forgiven; and Mr. Yates, desirous of being reallyreceived into the family, was disposed to look up to him and be guided.He was not very solid; but there was a hope of his becoming lesstrifling, of his being at least tolerably domestic and quiet; and at anyrate, there was comfort in finding his estate rather more, and his debtsmuch less, than he had feared, and in being consulted and treated asthe friend best worth attending to. There was comfort also in Tom, whogradually regained his health, without regaining the thoughtlessness andselfishness of his previous habits. He was the better for ever for hisillness. He had suffered, and he had learned to think: two advantagesthat he had never known before; and the self-reproach arising from thedeplorable event in Wimpole Street, to which he felt himself accessoryby all the dangerous intimacy of his unjustifiable theatre, made animpression on his mind which, at the age of six-and-twenty, with no wantof sense or good companions, was durable in its happy effects. He becamewhat he ought to be: useful to his father, steady and quiet, and notliving merely for himself.Here was comfort indeed! and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could placedependence on such sources of good, Edmund was contributing to hisfather's ease by improvement in the only point in which he had givenhim pain before--improvement in his spirits. After wandering about andsitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings, he had so welltalked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again.These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought theiralleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense of what was lost, andin part reconciling him to himself; though the anguish arising from theconviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was neverto be entirely done away.Too late he became aware how unfavourable to the character of any youngpeople must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia hadbeen always experiencing at home, where the excessive indulgence andflattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his ownseverity. He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract whatwas wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself; clearly saw that hehad but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits inhis presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him, andsending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able toattach them only by the blindness of her affection, and the excess ofher praise.Here had been grievous mismanagement; but, bad as it was, he graduallygrew to feel that it had not been the most direful mistake in his planof education. Something must have been wanting _within_, or time wouldhave worn away much of its ill effect. He feared that principle, activeprinciple, had been wanting; that they had never been properly taughtto govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which canalone suffice. They had been instructed theoretically in their religion,but never required to bring it into daily practice. To be distinguishedfor elegance and accomplishments, the authorised object of their youth,could have had no useful influence that way, no moral effect on themind. He had meant them to be good, but his cares had been directed tothe understanding and manners, not the disposition; and of the necessityof self-denial and humility, he feared they had never heard from anylips that could profit them.Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcelycomprehend to have been possible. Wretchedly did he feel, that with allthe cost and care of an anxious and expensive education, he had broughtup his daughters without their understanding their first duties, or hisbeing acquainted with their character and temper.The high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth, especially, weremade known to him only in their sad result. She was not to be prevailedon to leave Mr. Crawford. She hoped to marry him, and they continuedtogether till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain,and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the convictionrendered her temper so bad, and her feelings for him so like hatred,as to make them for a while each other's punishment, and then induce avoluntary separation.She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his happinessin Fanny, and carried away no better consolation in leaving him thanthat she _had_ divided them. What can exceed the misery of such a mindin such a situation?Mr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce; and so ended amarriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any better endthe effect of good luck not to be reckoned on. She had despised him,and loved another; and he had been very much aware that it was so. Theindignities of stupidity, and the disappointments of selfish passion,can excite little pity. His punishment followed his conduct, as did adeeper punishment the deeper guilt of his wife. _He_ was released fromthe engagement to be mortified and unhappy, till some other pretty girlcould attract him into matrimony again, and he might set forward on asecond, and, it is to be hoped, more prosperous trial of the state: ifduped, to be duped at least with good humour and good luck; while shemust withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement andreproach which could allow no second spring of hope or character.Where she could be placed became a subject of most melancholy andmomentous consultation. Mrs. Norris, whose attachment seemed to augmentwith the demerits of her niece, would have had her received at homeand countenanced by them all. Sir Thomas would not hear of it; and Mrs.Norris's anger against Fanny was so much the greater, from considering_her_ residence there as the motive. She persisted in placing hisscruples to _her_ account, though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured herthat, had there been no young woman in question, had there been no youngperson of either sex belonging to him, to be endangered by the societyor hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have offeredso great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her.As a daughter, he hoped a penitent one, she should be protected by him,and secured in every comfort, and supported by every encouragement to doright, which their relative situations admitted; but farther than _that_he could not go. Maria had destroyed her own character, and he wouldnot, by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored, byaffording his sanction to vice, or in seeking to lessen its disgrace, beanywise accessory to introducing such misery in another man's family ashe had known himself.It ended in Mrs. Norris's resolving to quit Mansfield and devote herselfto her unfortunate Maria, and in an establishment being formed for themin another country, remote and private, where, shut up together withlittle society, on one side no affection, on the other no judgment,it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their mutualpunishment.Mrs. Norris's removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary comfortof Sir Thomas's life. His opinion of her had been sinking from the dayof his return from Antigua: in every transaction together from thatperiod, in their daily intercourse, in business, or in chat, she hadbeen regularly losing ground in his esteem, and convincing him thateither time had done her much disservice, or that he had considerablyover-rated her sense, and wonderfully borne with her manners before. Hehad felt her as an hourly evil, which was so much the worse, as thereseemed no chance of its ceasing but with life; she seemed a part ofhimself that must be borne for ever. To be relieved from her, therefore,was so great a felicity that, had she not left bitter remembrancesbehind her, there might have been danger of his learning almost toapprove the evil which produced such a good.She was regretted by no one at Mansfield. She had never been able toattach even those she loved best; and since Mrs. Rushworth's elopement,her temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make hereverywhere tormenting. Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, noteven when she was gone for ever.That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure, to afavourable difference of disposition and circumstance, but in a greaterto her having been less the darling of that very aunt, less flatteredand less spoilt. Her beauty and acquirements had held but a secondplace. She had been always used to think herself a little inferior toMaria. Her temper was naturally the easiest of the two; her feelings,though quick, were more controllable, and education had not given her sovery hurtful a degree of self-consequence.She had submitted the best to the disappointment in Henry Crawford.After the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over,she had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again;and when the acquaintance was renewed in town, and Mr. Rushworth's housebecame Crawford's object, she had had the merit of withdrawing herselffrom it, and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends,in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted. This hadbeen her motive in going to her cousin's. Mr. Yates's convenience hadhad nothing to do with it. She had been allowing his attentions sometime, but with very little idea of ever accepting him; and had not hersister's conduct burst forth as it did, and her increased dread of herfather and of home, on that event, imagining its certain consequenceto herself would be greater severity and restraint, made her hastilyresolve on avoiding such immediate horrors at all risks, it is probablethat Mr. Yates would never have succeeded. She had not eloped with anyworse feelings than those of selfish alarm. It had appeared to her theonly thing to be done. Maria's guilt had induced Julia's folly.Henry Crawford, ruined by early independence and bad domestic example,indulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded vanity a little too long. Onceit had, by an opening undesigned and unmerited, led him into the way ofhappiness. Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of oneamiable woman's affections, could he have found sufficient exultationin overcoming the reluctance, in working himself into the esteem andtenderness of Fanny Price, there would have been every probability ofsuccess and felicity for him. His affection had already done something.Her influence over him had already given him some influence over her.Would he have deserved more, there can be no doubt that more would havebeen obtained, especially when that marriage had taken place, whichwould have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing herfirst inclination, and brought them very often together. Would he havepersevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have been his reward, and a rewardvery voluntarily bestowed, within a reasonable period from Edmund'smarrying Mary.Had he done as he intended, and as he knew he ought, by going down toEveringham after his return from Portsmouth, he might have been decidinghis own happy destiny. But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser'sparty; his staying was made of flattering consequence, and he was tomeet Mrs. Rushworth there. Curiosity and vanity were both engaged, andthe temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused tomake any sacrifice to right: he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey,resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it, or that itspurpose was unimportant, and staid. He saw Mrs. Rushworth, was receivedby her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive, and haveestablished apparent indifference between them for ever; but he wasmortified, he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smileshad been so wholly at his command: he must exert himself to subdue soproud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny's account; he mustget the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in hertreatment of himself.In this spirit he began the attack, and by animated perseverance hadsoon re-established the sort of familiar intercourse, of gallantry,of flirtation, which bounded his views; but in triumphing over thediscretion which, though beginning in anger, might have saved them both,he had put himself in the power of feelings on her side more strongthan he had supposed. She loved him; there was no withdrawing attentionsavowedly dear to her. He was entangled by his own vanity, with as littleexcuse of love as possible, and without the smallest inconstancy of mindtowards her cousin. To keep Fanny and the Bertrams from a knowledge ofwhat was passing became his first object. Secrecy could not have beenmore desirable for Mrs. Rushworth's credit than he felt it for his own.When he returned from Richmond, he would have been glad to see Mrs.Rushworth no more. All that followed was the result of her imprudence;and he went off with her at last, because he could not help it,regretting Fanny even at the moment, but regretting her infinitely morewhen all the bustle of the intrigue was over, and a very few months hadtaught him, by the force of contrast, to place a yet higher value on thesweetness of her temper, the purity of her mind, and the excellence ofher principles.That punishment, the public punishment of disgrace, should in a justmeasure attend _his_ share of the offence is, we know, not one of thebarriers which society gives to virtue. In this world the penalty isless equal than could be wished; but without presuming to look forwardto a juster appointment hereafter, we may fairly consider a man ofsense, like Henry Crawford, to be providing for himself no smallportion of vexation and regret: vexation that must rise sometimesto self-reproach, and regret to wretchedness, in having so requitedhospitality, so injured family peace, so forfeited his best, mostestimable, and endeared acquaintance, and so lost the woman whom he hadrationally as well as passionately loved.After what had passed to wound and alienate the two families, thecontinuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such close neighbourhood wouldhave been most distressing; but the absence of the latter, for somemonths purposely lengthened, ended very fortunately in the necessity, orat least the practicability, of a permanent removal. Dr. Grant, throughan interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes, succeeded toa stall in Westminster, which, as affording an occasion for leavingMansfield, an excuse for residence in London, and an increase of incometo answer the expenses of the change, was highly acceptable to those whowent and those who staid.Mrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have gone with someregret from the scenes and people she had been used to; but the samehappiness of disposition must in any place, and any society, secure hera great deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer Mary; and Maryhad had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity, ambition, love, anddisappointment in the course of the last half-year, to be in need of thetrue kindness of her sister's heart, and the rational tranquillityof her ways. They lived together; and when Dr. Grant had brought onapoplexy and death, by three great institutionary dinners in one week,they still lived together; for Mary, though perfectly resolved againstever attaching herself to a younger brother again, was long in findingamong the dashing representatives, or idle heir-apparents, who were atthe command of her beauty, and her £20,000, any one who could satisfy thebetter taste she had acquired at Mansfield, whose character and mannerscould authorise a hope of the domestic happiness she had there learnedto estimate, or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her head.Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect. He had not towait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed herin them. Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford, and observing toFanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such anotherwoman, before it began to strike him whether a very different kind ofwoman might not do just as well, or a great deal better: whether Fannyherself were not growing as dear, as important to him in all her smilesand all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been; and whether it mightnot be a possible, an hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warmand sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love.I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that every one maybe at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerablepassions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much asto time in different people. I only entreat everybody to believe thatexactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, andnot a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, andbecame as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.With such a regard for her, indeed, as his had long been, a regardfounded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness, andcompleted by every recommendation of growing worth, what could be morenatural than the change? Loving, guiding, protecting her, as he had beendoing ever since her being ten years old, her mind in so great a degreeformed by his care, and her comfort depending on his kindness, anobject to him of such close and peculiar interest, dearer by all his ownimportance with her than any one else at Mansfield, what was there nowto add, but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparklingdark ones. And being always with her, and always talking confidentially,and his feelings exactly in that favourable state which a recentdisappointment gives, those soft light eyes could not be very long inobtaining the pre-eminence.Having once set out, and felt that he had done so on this road tohappiness, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or makehis progress slow; no doubts of her deserving, no fears of opposition oftaste, no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarityof temper. Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits wanted nohalf-concealment, no self-deception on the present, no reliance onfuture improvement. Even in the midst of his late infatuation, he hadacknowledged Fanny's mental superiority. What must be his sense of itnow, therefore? She was of course only too good for him; but as nobodyminds having what is too good for them, he was very steadily earnest inthe pursuit of the blessing, and it was not possible that encouragementfrom her should be long wanting. Timid, anxious, doubting as she was, itwas still impossible that such tenderness as hers should not, at times,hold out the strongest hope of success, though it remained for a laterperiod to tell him the whole delightful and astonishing truth. Hishappiness in knowing himself to have been so long the beloved of such aheart, must have been great enough to warrant any strength of languagein which he could clothe it to her or to himself; it must have beena delightful happiness. But there was happiness elsewhere which nodescription can reach. Let no one presume to give the feelings of ayoung woman on receiving the assurance of that affection of which shehas scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope.Their own inclinations ascertained, there were no difficulties behind,no drawback of poverty or parent. It was a match which Sir Thomas'swishes had even forestalled. Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions,prizing more and more the sterling good of principle and temper, andchiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all that remained tohim of domestic felicity, he had pondered with genuine satisfaction onthe more than possibility of the two young friends finding their naturalconsolation in each other for all that had occurred of disappointment toeither; and the joyful consent which met Edmund's application, the highsense of having realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny fora daughter, formed just such a contrast with his early opinion on thesubject when the poor little girl's coming had been first agitated, astime is for ever producing between the plans and decisions of mortals,for their own instruction, and their neighbours' entertainment.Fanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted. His charitable kindnesshad been rearing a prime comfort for himself. His liberality had a richrepayment, and the general goodness of his intentions by her deservedit. He might have made her childhood happier; but it had been an errorof judgment only which had given him the appearance of harshness, anddeprived him of her early love; and now, on really knowing each other,their mutual attachment became very strong. After settling her atThornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort, the object ofalmost every day was to see her there, or to get her away from it.Selfishly dear as she had long been to Lady Bertram, she could not beparted with willingly by _her_. No happiness of son or niece could makeher wish the marriage. But it was possible to part with her, becauseSusan remained to supply her place. Susan became the stationary niece,delighted to be so; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness ofmind, and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been by sweetnessof temper, and strong feelings of gratitude. Susan could never bespared. First as a comfort to Fanny, then as an auxiliary, and last asher substitute, she was established at Mansfield, with every appearanceof equal permanency. Her more fearless disposition and happier nervesmade everything easy to her there. With quickness in understandingthe tempers of those she had to deal with, and no natural timidity torestrain any consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful to all;and after Fanny's removal succeeded so naturally to her influence overthe hourly comfort of her aunt, as gradually to become, perhaps, themost beloved of the two. In _her_ usefulness, in Fanny's excellence,in William's continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the generalwell-doing and success of the other members of the family, all assistingto advance each other, and doing credit to his countenance and aid, SirThomas saw repeated, and for ever repeated, reason to rejoice in what hehad done for them all, and acknowledge the advantages of early hardshipand discipline, and the consciousness of being born to struggle andendure.With so much true merit and true love, and no want of fortune andfriends, the happiness of the married cousins must appear as secure asearthly happiness can be. Equally formed for domestic life, and attachedto country pleasures, their home was the home of affection and comfort;and to complete the picture of good, the acquisition of Mansfieldliving, by the death of Dr. Grant, occurred just after they had beenmarried long enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feeltheir distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience.On that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage there,which, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had never been ableto approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm, soongrew as dear to her heart, and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, aseverything else within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had longbeen.THE END"
Emma,0,EMMABy Jane AustenVOLUME I
Emma,1,"CHAPTER IEmma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable homeand happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings ofexistence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with verylittle to distress or vex her.She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, beenmistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had diedtoo long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance ofher caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman asgoverness, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as agoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularlyof Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even beforeMiss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, themildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint;and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had beenliving together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emmadoing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, butdirected chiefly by her own.The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of havingrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little toowell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy toher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived,that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of anydisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor'sloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of thisbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of anycontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father andherself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheera long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, asusual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Westonwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, andpleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in consideringwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished andpromoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The wantof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled herpast kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she hadtaught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she haddevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and hownursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt ofgratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last sevenyears, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followedIsabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet adearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion suchas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowingall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, andpeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme ofhers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who hadsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was goingonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be thedifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a MissTaylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic,she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. Shedearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could notmeet her in conversation, rational or playful.The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse hadnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity ofmind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and thougheverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiabletemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, beingsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her dailyreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggledthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit fromIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,and give her pleasant society again.Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, andname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouseswere first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had manyacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, butnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for evenhalf a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh overit, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made itnecessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervousman, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, andhating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as theorigin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yetreconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of herbut with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from hishabits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose thatother people could feel differently from himself, he was very muchdisposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as forthem, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all therest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfullyas she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it wasimpossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,""Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is thatMr. Weston ever thought of her!""""I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is sucha good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deservesa good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us forever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of herown?""""A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, mydear.""""How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--Weshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay weddingvisit very soon.""""My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I couldnot walk half so far.""""No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,to be sure.""""The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such alittle way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying ourvisit?""""They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we havesettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston lastnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like goingto Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I onlydoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till youmentioned her--James is so obliged to you!""""I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would nothave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I amsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spokengirl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she alwayscurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when youhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lockof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be anexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylorto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goesover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He willbe able to tell her how we all are.""Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, andhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerablythrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. Thebackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walkedin and made it unnecessary.Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was notonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularlyconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He livedabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from theirmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, aftersome days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all werewell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animatedMr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, whichalways did him good; and his many inquiries after ""poor Isabella"" andher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.Woodhouse gratefully observed, ""It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must havehad a shocking walk.""""Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that Imust draw back from your great fire.""""But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may notcatch cold.""""Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.""""Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rainhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were atbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.""""By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of whatsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with mycongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did youall behave? Who cried most?""""Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.""""Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when itcomes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, itmust be better to have only one to please than two.""""Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesomecreature!"" said Emma playfully. ""That is what you have in your head, Iknow--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.""""I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,"" said Mr. Woodhouse, with asigh. ""I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.""""My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant onlymyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in ajoke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.""Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faultsin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: andthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knewit would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have himreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect byevery body.""Emma knows I never flatter her,"" said Mr. Knightley, ""but I meant noreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two personsto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be againer.""""Well,"" said Emma, willing to let it pass--""you want to hear aboutthe wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behavedcharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: nota tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that wewere going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting everyday.""""Dear Emma bears every thing so well,"" said her father. ""But, Mr.Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I amsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.""Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. ""Itis impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,"" said Mr.Knightley. ""We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we couldsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor'sadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor'stime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important toher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allowherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylormust be glad to have her so happily married.""""And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,"" said Emma, ""and a veryconsiderable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, youknow, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in theright, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, maycomfort me for any thing.""Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, ""Ah!my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, forwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any morematches.""""I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, forother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after suchsuccess, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marryagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and whoseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupiedeither in his business in town or among his friends here, alwaysacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--Mr. Weston need not spenda single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of apromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and theuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on thesubject, but I believed none of it.""Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I metwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he dartedaway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us fromFarmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the matchfrom that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.""""I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'"" said Mr. Knightley.""Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicatelyspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bringabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! Butif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, meansonly your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think itwould be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marryher,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, whydo you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? Youmade a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.""""And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--Ipity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess isnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to mypoor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am soentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;but I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing andthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and givenmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it mightnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfieldenough to comprehend that.""""A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage theirown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, thangood to them, by interference.""""Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,"" rejoinedMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. ""But, my dear, pray do notmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's familycircle grievously.""""Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody inHighbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and hasfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have himsingle any longer--and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day,he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind officedone for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way Ihave of doing him a service.""""Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good youngman, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him anyattention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That willbe a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as tomeet him.""""With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,"" said Mr. Knightley,laughing, ""and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much betterthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fishand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, aman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself."""
Emma,2,"CHAPTER IIMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,which for the last two or three generations had been rising intogentility and property. He had received a good education, but, onsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposedfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by enteringinto the militia of his county, then embodied.Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of hismilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshirefamily, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who werefull of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of herfortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--wasnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to theinfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off withdue decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce muchhappiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had ahusband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing dueto her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She hadresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother,but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother'sunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparisonof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted atonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst ofthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, hewas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boyhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of hismother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creatureof equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of thelittle Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some reluctancethe widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they wereovercome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care andthe wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek,and his own situation to improve as he could.A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia andengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way inLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern whichbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupationand the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of hislife passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easycompetence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoiningHighbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman asportionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes ofhis own friendly and social disposition.It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence hisschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he couldpurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they wereaccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtainedhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with everyprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He hadnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightfula well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him thepleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to bechosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as hisuncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assumethe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore,that he should ever want his father's assistance. His father had noapprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed herhusband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine thatany caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as hebelieved, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, andwas proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young manhad made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on assufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects akind of common concern.Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a livelycuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so littlereturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visithis father had been often talked of but never achieved.Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as amost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not adissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea withMrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Nowwas the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hopestrengthened when it was understood that he had written to his newmother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highburyincluded some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.""I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchillhas written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter,indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, andhe says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.""It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasingattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a mostwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulationwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a mostfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunateshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partialseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, andwho could ill bear to part with her.She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, withoutpain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeblecharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls wouldhave been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hopedwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties andprivations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance ofRandalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make theapproaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings inthe week together.Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her morethan satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprizeat his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left herat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go awayin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of herown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,and saying, ""Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.""There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing topity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased bybeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, whichhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomachcould bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to bedifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfitfor any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade themfrom having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, asearnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at thepains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perrywas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were oneof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, hecould not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the biasof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree withmany--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such anopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influenceevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys beingseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.Woodhouse would never believe it."
Emma,3,"CHAPTER IIIMr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much tohave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, fromhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of hisown little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not muchintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of latehours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance butsuch as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him, Highbury,including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parishadjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Notunfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen andthe best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred;and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, therewas scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up acard-table for him.Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and byMr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilegeof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for theelegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smilesof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom wereMrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always atthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched andcarried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship foreither James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, itwould have been a grievance.Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very oldlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with hersingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all theregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untowardcircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degreeof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for havingmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority tomake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her intooutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Heryouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devotedto the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a smallincome go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a womanwhom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal good-willand contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body,was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body'smerits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded withblessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighboursand friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity andcheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were arecommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She wasa great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse,full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or anestablishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences ofrefined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormouspay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real,honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity ofaccomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls mightbe sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a littleeducation, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard'sschool was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury wasreckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a greatdeal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her ownhands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walkedafter her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, whohad worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to theoccasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neatparlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or losea few sixpences by his fireside.These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able tocollect; and happy was she, for her father's sake, in the power; though,as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence ofMrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, andvery much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but thequiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening sospent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of thepresent day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in mostrespectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a mostwelcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knewvery well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account ofher beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening nolonger dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placedher, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebodyhad lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that ofparlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, andwas now just returned from a long visit in the country to some youngladies who had been at school there with her.She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sortwhich Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with afine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of greatsweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleasedwith her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue theacquaintance.She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith'sconversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--notinconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantlygrateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressedby the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she hadbeen used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all thosenatural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highburyand its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed wereunworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though verygood sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of thename of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a largefarm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--verycreditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly ofthem--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be theintimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and eleganceto be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve her; shewould detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into goodsociety; she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be aninteresting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming herown situation in life, her leisure, and powers.She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking andlistening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that theevening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, whichalways closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit andwatch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to thefire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulseof a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing everything well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delightedwith its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, andhelp and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with anurgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civilscruples of their guests.Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare.He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of hisyouth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made himrather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality wouldhave welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their healthmade him grieve that they would eat.Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could,with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrainhimself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, tosay:""Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An eggboiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an eggbetter than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any bodyelse; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one ofour small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a_little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. Youneed not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise thecustard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it coulddisagree with you.""Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a muchmore satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particularpleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith wasquite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personagein Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as muchpanic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off withhighly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which MissWoodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken handswith her at last!"
Emma,4,"CHAPTER IVHarriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quickand decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, andtelling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, sodid their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma hadvery early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respectMrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond theshrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his longwalk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriageher exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone toRandalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuableaddition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more ofher, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, gratefuldisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to beguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herselfwas very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power ofappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was nowant of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly theyoung friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such couldnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a differentsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was theobject of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harrietwould be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston therewas nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out whowere the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tellevery thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emmawas obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that inthe same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriethad no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just whatMrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs ofthe school in general, formed naturally a great part of theconversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins ofAbbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupiedher thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describethe many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged hertalkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so muchexultation of Mrs. Martin's having ""_two_ parlours, two very goodparlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard'sdrawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had livedfive-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two ofthem Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welchcow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it,it should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsomesummer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all todrink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozenpeople.""For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediatecause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelingsarose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother anddaughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when itappeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and wasalways mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doingsomething or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor littlefriend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were nottaken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number andmeaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready tospeak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry eveninggames; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured andobliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring hersome walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and inevery thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son intothe parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fondof singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was veryclever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, whileshe was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body inthe country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother andsisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (andthere was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any bodyto be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, hewould make a good husband. Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She wasin no hurry at all.""Well done, Mrs. Martin!"" thought Emma. ""You know what you are about.""""And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to sendMrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had everseen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the threeteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup withher.""""Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line ofhis own business? He does not read?""""Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read agood deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads theAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the windowseats--but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an evening,before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of theElegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar ofWakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children ofthe Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, buthe is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.""The next question was--""What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?""""Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very plain atfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now andthen, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston.He has passed you very often.""""That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without havingany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry areprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do.A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me;I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. Buta farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, asmuch above my notice as in every other he is below it.""""To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.""""I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imaginehis age to be?""""He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.""""Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother isperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as theyare, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probablyrepent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of youngwoman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be verydesirable.""""Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!""""Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are notborn to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirelyto make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money hemight come into when his father died, whatever his share of the familyproperty, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, andso forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich intime, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thingyet.""""To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have noindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talksof taking a boy another year.""""I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he doesmarry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though hissisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objectedto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for youto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularlycareful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being agentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station byevery thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people whowould take pleasure in degrading you.""""Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what anybody can do.""""You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I wouldhave you so firmly established in good society, as to be independenteven of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanentlywell connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few oddacquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should stillbe in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawnin by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife,who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education.""""To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any bodybut what had had some education--and been very well brought up. However,I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and I am sure I shallnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a greatregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be verysorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. Butif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better notvisit her, if I can help it.""Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw noalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, butshe trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no seriousdifficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of herown.They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on theDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully ather, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma wasnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a fewyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eyesufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was veryneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had noother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen,she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet'sinclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarilynoticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not bekept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon tocompose.""Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was quitea chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did notthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randallsmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it,but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well,Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him?Do you think him so very plain?""""He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothingcompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expectmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be sovery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, adegree or two nearer gentility.""""To be sure,"" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, ""he is not so genteelas real gentlemen.""""I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have beenrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that youmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield,you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. Ishould be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in companywith Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferiorcreature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought himat all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were notyou struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look andabrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be whollyunmodulated as I stood here.""""Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air andway of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. ButMr. Knightley is so very fine a man!""""Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair tocompare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not theonly gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Westonand Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare theirmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent.You must see the difference.""""Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an oldman. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.""""Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a persongrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should notbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, orawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in laterage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.Weston's time of life?""""There is no saying, indeed,"" replied Harriet rather solemnly.""But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking ofnothing but profit and loss.""""Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.""""How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from thecircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thingelse--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he todo with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a veryrich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb_us_.""""I wonder he did not remember the book""--was all Harriet's answer, andspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might besafely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Hernext beginning was,""In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might bemore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,because there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do tobe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commandingsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to setabout copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I thinka young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as amodel. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not knowwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners aresofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to pleaseyou. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?""She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr.Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, andsaid she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the youngfarmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellentmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for herto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every bodyelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that anybody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it hadentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming toHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her senseof its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite thegentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not ofany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficientincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was knownto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of himas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without anydeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautifulgirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, wasfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be littledoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usualweight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, ayoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned veryhandsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispensewith:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's ridingabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered byMr. Elton's admiration."
Emma,5,"CHAPTER V""I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,"" said Mr.Knightley, ""of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but Ithink it a bad thing.""""A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?""""I think they will neither of them do the other any good.""""You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with anew object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have beenseeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differentlywe feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! This willcertainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.Knightley.""""Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowingWeston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.""""Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinksexactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday,and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such agirl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall notallow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to livealone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps noman can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society ofone of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagineyour objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young womanwhich Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wantsto see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read moreherself. They will read together. She means it, I know.""""Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old.I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times ofbooks that she meant to read regularly through--and very good liststhey were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimesalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drewup when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so muchcredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have madeout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course ofsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thingrequiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to theunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safelyaffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade herto read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.""""I dare say,"" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, ""that I thought so_then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omittingto do any thing I wished.""""There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,""--saidMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. ""But I,""he soon added, ""who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, muststill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverestof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able toanswer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was alwaysquick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since shewas twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In hermother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits hermother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her.""""I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted anothersituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me toany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.""""Yes,"" said he, smiling. ""You are better placed _here_; very fit for awife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself tobe an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You mightnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem topromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on thevery material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doingas you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, Ishould certainly have named Miss Taylor.""""Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife tosuch a man as Mr. Weston.""""Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and thatwith every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. Wewill not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness ofcomfort, or his son may plague him.""""I hope not _that_.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do notforetell vexation from that quarter.""""Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma'sgenius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, theyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--ButHarriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her thevery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knowsnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is aflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has anything to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightfulinferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_ cannotgain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceitwith all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refinedenough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstanceshave placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give anystrength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationallyto the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a littlepolish.""""I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am moreanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.How well she looked last night!""""Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Verywell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.""""Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfectbeauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?""""I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldomseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partialold friend.""""Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, herglance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;'now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture ofgrown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?""""I have not a fault to find with her person,"" he replied. ""I think herall you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsomeshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity liesanother way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike ofHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.""""And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its notdoing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is anexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kindersister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may betrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make nolasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundredtimes.""""Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, andI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection,and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quitefrightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinionswith me.""""I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma'smother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think anypossible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made amatter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing anylittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot beexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectlyapproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is asource of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province togive advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this littleremains of office.""""Not at all,"" cried he; ""I am much obliged to you for it. It is verygood advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has oftenfound; for it shall be attended to.""""Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy abouther sister.""""Be satisfied,"" said he, ""I will not raise any outcry. I will keep myill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabelladoes not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what onefeels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!""""So do I,"" said Mrs. Weston gently, ""very much.""""She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means justnothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man shecared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in lovewith a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in somedoubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereaboutsto attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.""""There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolutionat present,"" said Mrs. Weston, ""as can well be; and while she is sohappy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment whichwould be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. Ido not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slightto the state, I assure you.""Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her ownand Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishesat Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable tohave them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soonafterwards made to ""What does Weston think of the weather; shall we haverain?"" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise aboutHartfield."
Emma,6,"CHAPTER VIEmma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a properdirection and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very goodpurpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of hisadmiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creatingas much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for.She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way offalling in love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regardto him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she couldnot suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. Hisperception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since herintroduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs ofhis growing attachment.""You have given Miss Smith all that she required,"" said he; ""you havemade her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when shecame to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added areinfinitely superior to what she received from nature.""""I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanteddrawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all thenatural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I havedone very little.""""If it were admissible to contradict a lady,"" said the gallant Mr.Elton--""I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, havetaught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.""""Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superaddeddecision of character! Skilful has been the hand!""""Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a dispositionmore truly amiable.""""I have no doubt of it."" And it was spoken with a sort of sighinganimation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleasedanother day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,to have Harriet's picture.""Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?"" said she: ""did youever sit for your picture?""Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,with a very interesting naivete,""Oh! dear, no, never.""No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,""What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I wouldgive any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a greatpassion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, andwas thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause oranother, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have herpicture!""""Let me entreat you,"" cried Mr. Elton; ""it would indeed be a delight!Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talentin favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How couldyou suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of yourlandscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitablefigure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?""Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with takinglikenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in rapturesabout mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. ""Well, if you give mesuch kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult;and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the linesabout the mouth which one ought to catch.""""Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I havenot a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.""""But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinksso little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answeringme? How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be drawn?'""""Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But stillI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.""Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against theearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly,and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts atportraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they mightdecide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many beginnings weredisplayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, andwater-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to doevery thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music thanmany might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.She played and sang;--and drew in almost every style; but steadinesshad always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree ofexcellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not tohave failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill eitheras an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have othersdeceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment oftenhigher than it deserved.There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps themost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had therebeen ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companionswould have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likenesspleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.""No great variety of faces for you,"" said Emma. ""I had only my ownfamily to study from. There is my father--another of my father--but theidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could onlytake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Westonagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always mykindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--andthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if shewould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me drawher four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all myattempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry andJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one ofthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have themdrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of threeor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to takeany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they arecoarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is mysketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping onthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you wouldwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's verylike. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is verygood. Then here is my last,""--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentlemanin small size, whole-length--""my last and my best--my brother, Mr. JohnKnightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I put it awayin a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could nothelp being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really madea very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed inthinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too flattering--butthat was a fault on the right side""--after all this, came poor dearIsabella's cold approbation of--""Yes, it was a little like--but to besure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of troublein persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; andaltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finishit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to everymorning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did thenforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or ratherfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at__present_, I will break my resolution now.""Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and wasrepeating, ""No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, asyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,"" with so interesting aconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not betterleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, thedeclaration must wait a little longer.She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to bea whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and wasdestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable stationover the mantelpiece.The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of notkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture ofyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was nodoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching everytouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gazeand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end toit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to herto employ him in reading.""If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindnessindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen theirksomeness of Miss Smith's.""Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing lesswould certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at thesmallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress,and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager,for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before itwas possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and hiscomplaisance were unexceptionable.The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enoughpleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no wantof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meantto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little moreheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence ofits being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its fillingits destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of thebeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both;with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promisingattachment was likely to add.Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.""By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of theparty.""The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of thepicture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through everycriticism.""Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty shewanted,""--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting thatshe was addressing a lover.--""The expression of the eye is most correct,but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault ofher face that she has them not.""""Do you think so?"" replied he. ""I cannot agree with you. It appearsto me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such alikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.""""You have made her too tall, Emma,"" said Mr. Knightley.Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmlyadded,""Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, sheis sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in shortgives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved, you know.Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea ofsuch a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!""""It is very pretty,"" said Mr. Woodhouse. ""So prettily done! Just as yourdrawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so wellas you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seemsto be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over hershoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.""""But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.Look at the tree.""""But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.""""You, sir, may say any thing,"" cried Mr. Elton, ""but I must confess thatI regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out ofdoors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any othersituation would have been much less in character. The naivete of MissSmith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keepmy eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.""The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a fewdifficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; theorder must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose tastecould be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhousecould not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs ofDecember. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than itwas removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. ""Might he be trustedwith the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executingit! he could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say howmuch he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.""""He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not givehim such a troublesome office for the world,""--brought on the desiredrepetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settledthe business.Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and givethe directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure itssafety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful ofnot being incommoded enough.""What a precious deposit!"" said he with a tender sigh, as he receivedit.""This man is almost too gallant to be in love,"" thought Emma. ""I shouldsay so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways ofbeing in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harrietexactly; it will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he doessigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I couldendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account."""
Emma,7,"CHAPTER VIIThe very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasionfor Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home toreturn again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had beentalked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing somethingextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half aminute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back toMrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, andfinding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left alittle parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and onopening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs whichshe had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter wasfrom him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.""Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know whatto do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter,at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her verymuch--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as she could toask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--"" Emma was half-ashamed of herfriend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.""Upon my word,"" she cried, ""the young man is determined not to lose anything for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.""""Will you read the letter?"" cried Harriet. ""Pray do. I'd rather youwould.""Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The styleof the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely nogrammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced agentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, andthe sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It wasshort, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stoodanxiously watching for her opinion, with a ""Well, well,"" and was at lastforced to add, ""Is it a good letter? or is it too short?""""Yes, indeed, a very good letter,"" replied Emma rather slowly--""sogood a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of hissisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whomI saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, ifleft quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for awoman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a naturaltalent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen inhand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentimentsto a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet(returning it,) than I had expected.""""Well,"" said the still waiting Harriet;--""well--and--and what shall Ido?""""What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to thisletter?""""Yes.""""But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--andspeedily.""""Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.""""Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will expressyourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your notbeing intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must beunequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitudeand concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, willpresent themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You neednot be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for hisdisappointment.""""You think I ought to refuse him then,"" said Harriet, looking down.""Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in anydoubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have beenunder a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feelin doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you wereconsulting me only as to the wording of it.""Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:""You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.""""No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would youadvise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.""""I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to dowith it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.""""I had no notion that he liked me so very much,"" said Harriet,contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in hersilence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of thatletter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,""I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ asto whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refusehim. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No' directly.It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, withhalf a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself,to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influenceyou.""""Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you wouldjust advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--Asyou say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not behesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,'perhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'""""Not for the world,"" said Emma, smiling graciously, ""would I advise youeither way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If youprefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the mostagreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should youhesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you atthis moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceiveyourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At thismoment whom are you thinking of?""The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned awayconfused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter wasstill in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. Atlast, with some hesitation, Harriet said--""Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as wellas I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almostmade up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?""""Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing justwhat you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings tomyself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitationin approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It wouldhave grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been theconsequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallestdegree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence;but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not havevisited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of youfor ever.""Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck herforcibly.""You could not have visited me!"" she cried, looking aghast. ""No, to besure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would havebeen too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would notgive up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thingin the world.""""Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but itmust have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.I must have given you up.""""Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed menever to come to Hartfield any more!""""Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! Iwonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He musthave a pretty good opinion of himself.""""I do not think he is conceited either, in general,"" said Harriet, herconscience opposing such censure; ""at least, he is very good natured,and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regardfor--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, thoughhe may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I mustconfess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comesto compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; andhis being so much attached to me--and his writing such a letter--but asto leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.""""Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not beparted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, orbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.""""Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.""Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a ""verytrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownishmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know thather husband could write a good letter.""""Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be alwayshappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. Buthow shall I do? What shall I say?""Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advisedits being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of herassistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistancebeing wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such asoftening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her upwith a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned atthe idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his motherand sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should notfancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come inher way at that moment, he would have been accepted after all.This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The businesswas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, butEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them byspeaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea ofMr. Elton.""I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,"" was said in rather asorrowful tone.""Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. Youare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.""""And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy butat Hartfield.""Some time afterwards it was, ""I think Mrs. Goddard would be very muchsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would--forMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only alinen-draper.""""One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacherof a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such anopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appearvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose sheis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly beamong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and Iare the only people to whom his looks and manners have explainedthemselves.""Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering thatpeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainlycheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towardsthe rejected Mr. Martin.""Now he has got my letter,"" said she softly. ""I wonder what they are alldoing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will be unhappytoo. I hope he will not mind it so very much.""""Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfullyemployed,"" cried Emma. ""At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewingyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautifulis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.""""My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.""""Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modestHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street tilljust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all thisevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party thosepleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warmprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busytheir imaginations all are!""Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger."
Emma,8,"CHAPTER VIIIHarriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had beenspending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to havea bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in everyrespect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possiblejust at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour ortwo to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she shouldreturn to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up hismind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and wasinduced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of hisown civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley,who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short,decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies andcivil hesitations of the other.""Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will notconsider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice andgo out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I hadbetter take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.""""My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.""""I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy toentertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take mythree turns--my winter walk.""""You cannot do better, sir.""""I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am avery slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, youhave another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.""""Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I thinkthe sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open thegarden door for you.""Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of beingimmediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for morechat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with morevoluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.""I cannot rate her beauty as you do,"" said he; ""but she is apretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of herdisposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in goodhands she will turn out a valuable woman.""""I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not bewanting.""""Come,"" said he, ""you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell youthat you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl'sgiggle; she really does you credit.""""Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had beenof some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where theymay. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.""""You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?""""Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than sheintended.""""Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.""""Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!""""Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.""Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore saidnothing. He presently added, with a smile,""I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you thatI have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear ofsomething to her advantage.""""Indeed! how so? of what sort?""""A very serious sort, I assure you;"" still smiling.""Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her?Who makes you their confidant?""Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr.Elton looked up to him.""I have reason to think,"" he replied, ""that Harriet Smith will soon havean offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--RobertMartin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to havedone his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.""""He is very obliging,"" said Emma; ""but is he sure that Harriet means tomarry him?""""Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came tothe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knowsI have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whetherI thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whetherI thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choicealtogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of societyabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hearbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to thepurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me everything; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing inthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son andbrother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to methat he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced hecould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether senthim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, hewould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the housethinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happenedthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allowmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appearto have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinkinghim at all a tiresome wretch.""""Pray, Mr. Knightley,"" said Emma, who had been smiling to herselfthrough a great part of this speech, ""how do you know that Mr. Martindid not speak yesterday?""""Certainly,"" replied he, surprized, ""I do not absolutely know it; but itmay be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?""""Come,"" said she, ""I will tell you something, in return for whatyou have told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and wasrefused.""This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stoodup, in tall indignation, and said,""Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is thefoolish girl about?""""Oh! to be sure,"" cried Emma, ""it is always incomprehensible to a manthat a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man alwaysimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.""""Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is themeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it isso; but I hope you are mistaken.""""I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.""""You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is yourdoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.""""And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should notfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprizedindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, hedoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were evergot over.""""Not Harriet's equal!"" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; andwith calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, ""No, he isnot her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as insituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What areHarriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to anyconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter ofnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, andcertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarderat a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of anyinformation. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young andtoo simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can haveno experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to haveany that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, andthat is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account,as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that,as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that asto a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But Icould not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to therebeing no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, ingood hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not thesmallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-outupon her extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend'sleaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remembersaying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, willthink this a good match.'""""I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say anysuch thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all hismerit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whomI could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you shouldthink it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine arevery different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You arenot just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very differentlyby others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two,but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere inwhich she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation.""""A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to arespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!""""As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she maybe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to payfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those withwhom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her fatheris a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance isvery liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement orcomfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; thatshe associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, willdeny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.""""Whoever might be her parents,"" said Mr. Knightley, ""whoever may havehad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part oftheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. Afterreceiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard'shands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line,to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends evidently thoughtthis good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough. She desired nothingbetter herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind hadno distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was ashappy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense ofsuperiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been nofriend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceededso far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined tohim. I know him well. He has too much real feeling to address anywoman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he isthe farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he hadencouragement.""It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to thisassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subjectagain.""You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not socontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but shehas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have herunderstanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, andsupposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured,let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are nottrivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, abeautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of anhundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on thesubject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fallin love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, withsuch loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and soughtafter, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently aclaim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim,comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper andmanner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness tobe pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex ingeneral would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claimsa woman could possess.""""Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almostenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapplyit as you do.""""To be sure!"" cried she playfully. ""I know _that_ is the feeling ofyou all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what everyman delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies hisjudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever tomarry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, justentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered atbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No--pray lether have time to look about her.""""I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,"" said Mr. Knightleypresently, ""though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceivethat it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her upwith such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that,in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her.Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothingso easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. MissHarriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, thoughshe is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse tosay, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond ofconnecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudentmen would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might beinvolved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Lether marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy forever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach herto be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and largefortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the restof her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marrysomebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at theold writing-master's son.""""We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that therecan be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other moreangry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible;she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent anysecond application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him,whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend tosay that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you therewas very little for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so muchagainst him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed tofavour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had seenany body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of herfriends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seennobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not,while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. But the caseis altered now. She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but agentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet.""""Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!"" cried Mr.Knightley.--""Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, andgood-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility thanHarriet Smith could understand.""Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but wasreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. Shedid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a betterjudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have himsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempton Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He wasthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.""Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I hope itwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best knownto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, itis fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;--and asa friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think itwill be all labour in vain.""Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,""Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to makean imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as anybody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He isas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's.He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favouritewherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreservedmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he doesnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with greatanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters areintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.""""I am very much obliged to you,"" said Emma, laughing again. ""If I hadset my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been verykind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet tomyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope toequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.""""Good morning to you,""--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He wasvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and wasmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he hadgiven; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,was provoking him exceedingly.Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was moreindistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not alwaysfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced thather opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. Hewalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. Shewas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time andthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's stayingaway so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of theyoung man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting withHarriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dreadof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and whenHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having anysuch reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction whichsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman'sfriendship and woman's feelings would not justify.He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she consideredthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neitherwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite ofMr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on sucha question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, shewas able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfullyto be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly might haveheard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, andMr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as tomoney matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwiseto them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for theinfluence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr.Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of itseffects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcomingany hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; andmore than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very suredid not belong to Mr. Elton.Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, notto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had beentelling her something, which she repeated immediately with greatdelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he wascoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, andfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his roadto London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was thewhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby itwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much topersuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would notdo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very__particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he wouldnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about avery enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedinglyprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very surethere must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Eltononly looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more aboutMr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, ""that she didnot pretend to understand what his business might be, but she onlyknew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think theluckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not hisequal for beauty or agreeableness."""
Emma,9,"CHAPTER IXMr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel withherself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual beforehe came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looksshewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent.On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justifiedand endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the commonsitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentencesof admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they werevisibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment asher youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfiedof Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished acontrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal ofuseful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a fewfirst chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was mucheasier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imaginationrange and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlargeher comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literarypursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision shewas making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribingall the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thinquarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented withciphers and trophies.In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale arenot uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written outat least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of itfrom her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more.Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrotea very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the firstorder, in form as well as quantity.Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as thegirls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their puttingin. ""So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--hewondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.""And it always ended in ""Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.""His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but hehad desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,something, he thought, might come from that quarter.It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highburyin general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only onewhose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really goodenigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she hadthe pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections;and at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful thatnothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to thesex should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politestpuzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, andrather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,    My first doth affliction denote,      Which my second is destin'd to feel    And my whole is the best antidote      That affliction to soften and heal.--made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it somepages ago already.""Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?"" said she; ""thatis the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier toyou.""""Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in hislife. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse""--hestopt a moment--""or Miss Smith could inspire him.""The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. Hecalled for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the tablecontaining, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressedto a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from hismanner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.""I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,"" said he. ""Being myfriend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.""The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma couldunderstand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he foundit easier to meet her eye than her friend's. He was gone the nextmoment:--after another moment's pause,""Take it,"" said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towardsHarriet--""it is for you. Take your own.""But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, neverloth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.        To Miss--          CHARADE.    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.    Another view of man, my second brings,      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!    But ah! united, what reverse we have!      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,      May its approval beam in that soft eye!She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it throughagain to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and thenpassing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, whileHarriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope anddulness, ""Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worsecharades. _Courtship_--a very good hint. I give you credit for it. Thisis feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--'Pray, Miss Smith,give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and myintentions in the same glance.'      May its approval beam in that soft eye!Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, thejustest that could be given.      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much inlove, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had thebenefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your lifeyou would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charadeindeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soonnow.""She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by theeagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.""What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--Icannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to findit out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is itkingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady.Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.Can it be Neptune?      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only onesyllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?""""Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinkingof? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friendupon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.For Miss ------, read Miss Smith.    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.That is _court_.    Another view of man, my second brings;      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!That is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.    But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!      Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, whichI think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty incomprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt ofits being written for you and to you.""Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She readthe concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could notspeak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.Emma spoke for her.""There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,""said she, ""that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. Youare his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. Ithought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, itis clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes onthe subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so longhave I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened.I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton weremost desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility havereally so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, mydear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman maywell feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothingbut good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration,independence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all yourreal friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacyfor ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush ineither of us.""""Dear Miss Woodhouse!""--and ""Dear Miss Woodhouse,"" was all that Harriet,with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they didarrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear toher friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as sheought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.""Whatever you say is always right,"" cried Harriet, ""and therefore Isuppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could nothave imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. Heis so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--'To Miss ------.'Dear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?""""I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is acertainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue tothe play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed bymatter-of-fact prose.""""It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do takeplace!""""When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--andreally it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is soevidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement ofother people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to oneanother by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marryingwill be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be asomething in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the rightdirection, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.      The course of true love never did run smooth--A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on thatpassage.""""That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the veryhandsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every bodysays he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;that he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And soexcellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he hasever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look backto the first time I saw him! How little did I think!--The two Abbots andI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard hewas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to lookthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let melook too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought helooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.""""This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be, mustbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and weare not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious tosee you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character givesevery assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the samecountry and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it willbe accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in thecommon phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, therespectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfythem.""""Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understandevery thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. Thischarade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made anything like it.""""I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining ityesterday.""""I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.""""I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.""""It is as long again as almost all we have had before.""""I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such thingsin general cannot be too short.""Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactorycomparisons were rising in her mind.""It is one thing,"" said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--""to havevery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there isany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what youmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades likethis.""Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin'sprose.""Such sweet lines!"" continued Harriet--""these two last!--But how shall Iever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?--Oh! MissWoodhouse, what can we do about that?""""Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I daresay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other willpass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shallchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.""""Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautifulcharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.""""Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should notwrite it into your book.""""Oh! but those two lines are""----""The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for privateenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does itsmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and avery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend uponit, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better than hispassion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, orneither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can beno possible reflection on you.""Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down adeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degreeof publicity.""I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,"" said she.""Very well,"" replied Emma; ""a most natural feeling; and the longer itlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: youwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving himso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially anything that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit ofgallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him.""Harriet looked grave.""My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--Youwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and tooquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaningwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a littletribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would nothave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards methan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He hasencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls overthis charade.""""Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.""Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by therecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of ""Well, my dears, how doesyour book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?""""Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. Apiece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, we suppose,by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copiedit in.""She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly anddistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of everypart as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and, as she hadforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.""Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that Ican easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written soprettily, but you, Emma.""Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a verytender sigh, he added,""Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear motherwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I canremember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you haveheard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there areseveral.    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,    The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,    Though of his near approach afraid,      So fatal to my suit before.And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever allthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.""""Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from theElegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.""""Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near beingchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her herenext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her--and whatroom there will be for the children?""""Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she alwayshas;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, youknow. Why should there be any change?""""I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--notsince last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley'sbeing a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly takenaway from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to seeMiss Taylor here!""""She will not be surprized, papa, at least.""""I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when Ifirst heard she was going to be married.""""We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella ishere.""""Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--sheis coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.""""It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case ofnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and weought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the timethey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be takenout for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim thisChristmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him, thanwith us.""""It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to beanywhere but at Hartfield.""Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on hisbrother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat musinga little while, and then said,""But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back sosoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her tostay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.""""Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and Ido not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind herhusband.""This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhousecould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affectedby the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she immediatelyled to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.""Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brotherand sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children.We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which shewill think the handsomest, Henry or John?""""Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will beto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.""""I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.""""Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is theeldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, thatthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which Ithought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. Theyare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They willcome and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bitof string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him kniveswere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough withthem very often.""""He appears rough to you,"" said Emma, ""because you are so very gentleyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would notthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and ifthey misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is anaffectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionatefather. The children are all fond of him.""""And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in avery frightful way!""""But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is suchenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule oftheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.""""Well, I cannot understand it.""""That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannotunderstand the pleasures of the other.""Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separatein preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of thisinimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma couldreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned inhis the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die;and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensiblereason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be madeup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallestdegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must giveway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about hisdining with him--had made such a point of it, that he had promised himconditionally to come.Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friendon their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged--shere-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking thepaper from the table, she returned it--""Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thankyou for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have venturedto write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not take itamiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eightlines.""Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked ratherdoubtingly--rather confused; said something about ""honour,""--glanced atEmma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, tookit up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off anawkward moment, Emma smilingly said,""You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charademust not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman'sapprobation while he writes with such gallantry.""""I have no hesitation in saying,"" replied Mr. Elton, though hesitatinga good deal while he spoke; ""I have no hesitation in saying--at leastif my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest doubt that,could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at thebook again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as theproudest moment of his life.""After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not thinkit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there wasa sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her tolaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender andthe sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share."
Emma,10,"CHAPTER XThough now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather toprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on themorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, wholived a little way out of Highbury.Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a laneleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street ofthe place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr.Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, abouta quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and notvery good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It hadno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by thepresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibilityof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observingeyes.--Emma's remark was--""There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of thesedays.""--Harriet's was--""Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellowcurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.""""I do not often walk this way _now_,"" said Emma, as they proceeded, ""but_then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimatelyacquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this partof Highbury.""Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage,and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriorsand probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, withMr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.""I wish we could contrive it,"" said she; ""but I cannot think of anytolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquireabout of his housekeeper--no message from my father.""She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of someminutes, Harriet thus began again--""I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, orgoing to be married! so charming as you are!""--Emma laughed, and replied,""My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;I must find other people charming--one other person at least. And Iam not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very littleintention of ever marrying at all.""""Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.""""I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to betempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of thequestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather notbe tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, Imust expect to repent it.""""Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!""--""I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fallin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been inlove; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such asituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as muchmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, nevercould I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first andalways right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.""""But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!""""That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and ifI thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--sosmiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--and so aptto tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marryto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be anylikeness, except in being unmarried.""""But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!""""Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is povertyonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A singlewoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable oldmaid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of goodfortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasantas any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against thecandour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a verynarrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, andgenerally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. Thisdoes not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good natured andtoo silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the tasteof every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has notcontracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in theworld, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobodyis afraid of her: that is a great charm.""""Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when yougrow old?""""If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a greatmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be morein want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman'susual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as theyare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall readmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as forobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth thegreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evilto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all thechildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enoughof them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation thatdeclining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and everyfear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, itsuits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. Mynephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.""""Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen hera hundred times--but are you acquainted?""""Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes toHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceitwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore peoplehalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about JaneFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter fromher is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go roundand round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of astomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears ofnothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tiresme to death.""They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics weresuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poorwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, hercounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romanticexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education haddone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, andalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. Inthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which shecame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could givecomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression ofthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,""These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they makeevery thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing butthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say howsoon it may all vanish from my mind?""""Very true,"" said Harriet. ""Poor creatures! one can think of nothingelse.""""And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,"" saidEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which endedthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought theminto the lane again. ""I do not think it will,"" stopping to look oncemore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the stillgreater within.""Oh! dear, no,"" said her companion.They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend waspassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emmatime only to say farther,""Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in goodthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassionhas produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all thatis truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we canfor them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.""Harriet could just answer, ""Oh! dear, yes,"" before the gentleman joinedthem. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were thefirst subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visithe would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley aboutwhat could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back toaccompany them.""To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,"" thought Emma;""to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increaseof love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on thedeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.""Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soonafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on oneside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she hadnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits ofdependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediatelystopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacingof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of thefootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she wouldfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the timeshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfortof farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from thecottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetchbroth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk toand question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would havebeen the most natural, had she been acting just then without design;and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, withoutany obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow;and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently ina conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking withanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw backa little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to jointhem.Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was onlygiving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at hisfriend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese,the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all thedessert.""This would soon have led to something better, of course,"" was herconsoling reflection; ""any thing interests between those who love; andany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If Icould but have kept longer away!""They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicaragepales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into thehouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, andfall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short,and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged toentreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself torights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.""Part of my lace is gone,"" said she, ""and I do not know how I am tocontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but Ihope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stopat your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string,or any thing just to keep my boot on.""Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing couldexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house andendeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they weretaken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behindit was another with which it immediately communicated; the door betweenthem was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receiveher assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leavethe door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Eltonshould close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; butby engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to makeit practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoiningroom. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could beprotracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make herappearance.The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a mostfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of havingschemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point.He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet thathe had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other littlegallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.""Cautious, very cautious,"" thought Emma; ""he advances inch by inch, andwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.""Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by heringenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had beenthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading themforward to the great event."
Emma,11,"CHAPTER XIMr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's powerto superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of hersister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to beexpected--she did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional,fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They mightadvance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow orother whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisurefor them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less theywill do for themselves.Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absentfrom Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had beendivided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays ofthis autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it wastherefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by theirSurry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not beinduced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; andwho consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy inforestalling this too short visit.He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a littleof the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring someof the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. JohnKnightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids,all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival,the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersedand disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves couldnot have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer evenfor this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her fatherwere so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternalsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for theirhaving instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating anddrinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for,without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be longa disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendanceon them.Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quietmanners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wraptup in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderlyattached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, awarmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a faultin any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or anyquickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited alsomuch of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-carefulof that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fondof her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a stronghabit of regard for every old acquaintance.Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his privatecharacter; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generallypleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not anill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such areproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, withsuch a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defectsin it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her tempermust hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which shewanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrongin him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries toIsabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might havepassed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, withoutpraise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personalcompliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault ofall in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectfulforbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patiencethat could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities andfidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance orsharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. JohnKnightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generallya strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma'scharity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequentlyto be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, ofevery visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being ofnecessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with amelancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's attentionto the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.""Ah, my dear,"" said he, ""poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.""""Oh yes, sir,"" cried she with ready sympathy, ""how you must miss her!And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been sogrieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do withouther.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well, sir.""""Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that theplace agrees with her tolerably.""Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubtsof the air of Randalls.""Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in mylife--never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.""""Very much to the honour of both,"" was the handsome reply.""And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?"" asked Isabella in theplaintive tone which just suited her father.Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--""Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.""""Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since theymarried. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,either at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, mostfrequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Westonis really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way,you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must beaware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to beassured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her byany means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exacttruth.""""Just as it should be,"" said Mr. John Knightley, ""and just as I hopedit was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not bedoubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. Ihave been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the changebeing so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you haveEmma's account, I hope you will be satisfied.""""Why, to be sure,"" said Mr. Woodhouse--""yes, certainly--I cannotdeny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us prettyoften--but then--she is always obliged to go away again.""""It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quiteforget poor Mr. Weston.""""I think, indeed,"" said John Knightley pleasantly, ""that Mr. Weston hassome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of thepoor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claimsof the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella,she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting allthe Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.""""Me, my love,"" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--""Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, agreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been forthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of MissTaylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slightingMr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he doesnot deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that everexisted. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equalfor temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him thatvery windy day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness lastSeptember twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, Ihave been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a betterman in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.""""Where is the young man?"" said John Knightley. ""Has he been here on thisoccasion--or has he not?""""He has not been here yet,"" replied Emma. ""There was a strongexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended innothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.""""But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,"" said her father.""He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a veryproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it verywell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, onecannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--""""My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.""""Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thoughtit--and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well,time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was anexceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great dealof pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.28th--and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and itwas signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'--I remember that perfectly.""""How very pleasing and proper of him!"" cried the good-hearted Mrs. JohnKnightley. ""I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. Buthow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There issomething so shocking in a child's being taken away from his parents andnatural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part withhim. To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any bodywho proposed such a thing to any body else.""""Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,"" observed Mr.John Knightley coolly. ""But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have feltwhat you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is ratheran easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takesthings as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other,depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for hiscomforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playingwhist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection,or any thing that home affords.""Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and hadhalf a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. Shewould keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable andvaluable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home tohimself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down onthe common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it wasimportant.--It had a high claim to forbearance."
Emma,12,"CHAPTER XIIMr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination ofMr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him inIsabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided it;and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she hadparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreementbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the properinvitation.She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was timeto make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not beenin the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must beout of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they hadever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration offriendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the childrenwith her--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, whowas now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be dancedabout in her aunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began with gravelooks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all inthe usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all theunceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and thena little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring thebaby,""What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but withregard to these children, I observe we never disagree.""""If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women,and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings withthem, as you are where these children are concerned, we might alwaysthink alike.""""To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in thewrong.""""Yes,"" said he, smiling--""and reason good. I was sixteen years old whenyou were born.""""A material difference then,"" she replied--""and no doubt you were muchmy superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not thelapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good dealnearer?""""Yes--a good deal _nearer_.""""But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if wethink differently.""""I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and bynot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, littleEmma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing oldgrievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.""""That's true,"" she cried--""very true. Little Emma, grow up a betterwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as goodintentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects onmy side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know thatMr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.""""A man cannot be more so,"" was his short, full answer.""Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.""This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightleymade his appearance, and ""How d'ye do, George?"" and ""John, how areyou?"" succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness thatseemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have ledeither of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of theother.The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cardsentirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, andthe little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and hisdaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totallydistinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining inone or the other.The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principallyof those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had generallysome point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curiousanecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm atDonwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and togive all such local information as could not fail of being interestingto a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of hislife, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a drain, the changeof a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre forwheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equalityof interest by John, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if hiswilling brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquirieseven approached a tone of eagerness.While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying afull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.""My poor dear Isabella,"" said he, fondly taking her hand, andinterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of herfive children--""How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You andI will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we allhave a little gruel.""Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both theMr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--andtwo basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise ofgruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by everybody, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,""It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at SouthEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.""""Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we should nothave gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly forthe weakness in little Bella's throat,--both sea air and bathing.""""Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her anygood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, thoughperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of useto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.""""Come, come,"" cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, ""I mustbeg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;--Iwho have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dearIsabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; andhe never forgets you.""""Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?""""Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he hasnot time to take care of himself--he tells me he has not time to takecare of himself--which is very sad--but he is always wanted all roundthe country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. Butthen there is not so clever a man any where.""""And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. Hewill be so pleased to see my little ones.""""I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to askhim about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,you had better let him look at little Bella's throat.""""Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly anyuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service toher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.Wingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.""""It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of useto her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would havespoken to--""You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,"" said Emma, ""Ihave not heard one inquiry after them.""""Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mentionthem in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.--Theyare always so pleased to see my children.--And that excellent MissBates!--such thorough worthy people!--How are they, sir?""""Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had abad cold about a month ago.""""How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have beenthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them moregeneral or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.""""That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree youmention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavyas he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call italtogether a sickly season.""""No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sicklyexcept--""Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is alwaysa sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is adreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and theair so bad!""""No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London isvery superior to most others!--You must not confound us with Londonin general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is verydifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should beunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there ishardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in:but _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity ofBrunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.""""Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--butafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you differentcreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I thinkyou are any of you looking well at present.""""I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting thoselittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirelyfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children wererather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were alittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness ofcoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for Iassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had eversent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, thatyou do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,"" turning her eyes withaffectionate anxiety towards her husband.""Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightleyvery far from looking well.""""What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?"" cried Mr. JohnKnightley, hearing his own name.""I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you lookingwell--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could havewished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before youleft home.""""My dear Isabella,""--exclaimed he hastily--""pray do not concern yourselfabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself andthe children, and let me look as I chuse.""""I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,""cried Emma, ""about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailifffrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Willnot the old prejudice be too strong?""And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced togive her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothingworse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and JaneFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at thatmoment very happy to assist in praising.""That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!"" said Mrs. John Knightley.--""Itis so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a momentaccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good oldgrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I alwaysregret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more atHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such adelightful companion for Emma.""Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,""Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another prettykind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have abetter companion than Harriet.""""I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be sovery accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.""This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similarmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did notclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplieda great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubtingdecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and prettysevere Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met withtolerably;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughterhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was inher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who neverhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smoothgruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and orderedit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was adangerous opening.""Ah!"" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on herwith tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, ""Ah!there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. Itdoes not bear talking of."" And for a little while she hoped he would nottalk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him tothe relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes,however, he began with,""I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,instead of coming here.""""But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children agreat deal of good.""""And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have beento South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized tohear you had fixed upon South End.""""I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quitea mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there, neverfound the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it isentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he maybe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, andhis own brother and family have been there repeatedly.""""You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--Perrywas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all thesea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, bywhat I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away fromthe sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should haveconsulted Perry.""""But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider howgreat it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.""""Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing elseshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much tochuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get intoa worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a veryill-judged measure.""Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when hehad reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at herbrother-in-law's breaking out.""Mr. Perry,"" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, ""would doas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make itany business of his, to wonder at what I do?--at my taking my family toone part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use ofmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--I want his directions no more thanhis drugs."" He paused--and growing cooler in a moment, added, with onlysarcastic dryness, ""If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife andfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greaterexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be aswilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.""""True, true,"" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--""verytrue. That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I was tellingyou of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to theright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceiveany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means ofinconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactlythe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrowmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give meyour opinion.""Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on hisfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, beenattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--but the soothingattentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, andthe immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of theother, prevented any renewal of it."
Emma,13,"CHAPTER XIIIThere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. JohnKnightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morningamong her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over whatshe had done every evening with her father and sister. She had nothingto wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was adelightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than theirmornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take nodenial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse waspersuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division ofthe party.How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if hecould, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actuallyat Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question onthat head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma longto convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room forHarriet also.Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were theonly persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, aswell as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination beingconsulted in every thing.The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event thatMr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spentby Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed witha cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma calledon her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard toRandalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddardwas full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harrietherself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded herfrom this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her losswithout many tears.Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard'sunavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr.Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at lasttolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a mostcomfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had notadvanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by Mr.Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowlytogether in conversation about the invalid--of whom he, on the rumourof considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he mightcarry some report of her to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. JohnKnightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldestboys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a countryrun, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and ricepudding they were hastening home for. They joined company andproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend'scomplaint;--""a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heatabout her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had oftenalarmed her with them."" Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, ashe exclaimed,""A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putridinfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care ofyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.Why does not Perry see her?""Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised thisexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience andcare; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which shecould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assistthan not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,""It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much likesnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, Ishould really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father fromventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel thecold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so greata disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton,in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me alittle hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice andwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more thancommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.""Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kindcare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma,too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear himimpartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied withhis muttering acknowledgment of its being ""very cold, certainly verycold,"" and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls,and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hourof the evening.""You do quite right,"" said she;--""we will make your apologies to Mr. andMrs. Weston.""But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civillyoffering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's onlyobjection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much promptsatisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never hadhis broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than whenhe next looked at her.""Well,"" said she to herself, ""this is most strange!--After I had gothim off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet illbehind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for diningout--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that anything gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a mostvaluable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in lovewith Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dineout wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see readywit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.""Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do himthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in hismanner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice whileassuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fairfriend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meetingher again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; andhe sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance ofapprobation much in his favour.After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley beganwith--""I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. Withmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please,every feature works.""""Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,"" replied Emma; ""but where there isa wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a greatdeal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he willhave the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfectgood-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.""""Yes,"" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, ""he seemsto have a great deal of good-will towards you.""""Me!"" she replied with a smile of astonishment, ""are you imagining me tobe Mr. Elton's object?""""Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it neveroccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.""""Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!""""I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether itis so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think yourmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had betterlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.""""I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton andI are very good friends, and nothing more;"" and she walked on, amusingherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from apartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of highpretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very wellpleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and inwant of counsel. He said no more.Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that inspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinkingfrom it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldestdaughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of theweather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his owngoing, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it wascold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe;and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snowwere finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being soovercharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white worldin a very short time.Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. Thepreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice ofhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipatednothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and thewhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing hisdiscontent.""A man,"" said he, ""must have a very good opinion of himself when he askspeople to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day asthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a mostagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatestabsurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--The folly of not allowingpeople to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not stayingcomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out suchan evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship weshould deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothingthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance ofthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his viewor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelterthat he can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours inanother man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not saidand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses andfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shiveringcreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have hadat home.""Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which nodoubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the ""Very true,my love,"" which must have been usually administered by his travellingcompanion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from makingany answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded beingquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him totalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without openingher lips.They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought withpleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation andcheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that shebegan to think he must have received a different account of Harriet fromwhat had reached her. She had sent while dressing, and the answer hadbeen, ""Much the same--not better.""""_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,"" said she presently, ""was not sopleasant as I had hoped--'Not better' was _my_ answer.""His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice ofsentiment as he answered.""Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you thatwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thingbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned--Ihad flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as Iknew had been given her in the morning.""Emma smiled and answered--""My visit was of use to the nervous part ofher complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as youprobably heard.""""Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--""""He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrowmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it isimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!""""Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.""This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was reallyestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismaywhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.""What an excellent device,"" said he, ""the use of a sheepskin forcarriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel coldwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed haverendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fencedand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its wayunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a verycold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha!snows a little I see.""""Yes,"" said John Knightley, ""and I think we shall have a good deal ofit.""""Christmas weather,"" observed Mr. Elton. ""Quite seasonable; andextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not beginyesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possiblyhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there beenmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quitethe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invitestheir friends about them, and people think little of even the worstweather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothingcould be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get awaytill that very day se'nnight.""Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, butsaid only, coolly,""I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.""At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too muchastonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemedquite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.""We are sure of excellent fires,"" continued he, ""and every thing in thegreatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. Westonindeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, sohospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but wheresmall parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably;and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short bytwo than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning witha soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties ofLondon, may not quite enter into our feelings.""""I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine withany body.""""Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law hadbeen so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you willbe paid for all this, when you will have little labour and greatenjoyment.""""My first enjoyment,"" replied John Knightley, as they passed through thesweep-gate, ""will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again."""
Emma,14,"CHAPTER XIVSome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as theywalked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose hisjoyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr.Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for theplace.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just ashappy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in theworld to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not anyone, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to andunderstood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, thelittle affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her fatherand herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Westonhad not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communicationof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private lifedepends, was one of the first gratifications of each.This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might notafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but thevery sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was gratefulto Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr.Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all thatwas enjoyable to the utmost.The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone throughbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enoughto give the history of it, besides all the history of his own andIsabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed justgot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see hisdaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almostwholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away andwelcome her dear Emma.Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorryto find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towardsHarriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, butwas continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, andsolicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgettinghim, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internalsuggestion of ""Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it bepossible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections fromHarriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""--Yet he would be so anxiousfor her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring herdrawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terriblylike a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve hergood manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's,in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positivelycivil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going onamongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton'snonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enoughto know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; sheheard the words ""my son,"" and ""Frank,"" and ""my son,"" repeated severaltimes over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspectedthat he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she couldquiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any revivingquestion from her would have been awkward.Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of nevermarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr.Frank Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequentlythought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--thatif she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between thefamilies, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to bea match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and thoughnot meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up asituation which she believed more replete with good than any she couldchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intentionof finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, anda sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends'imaginations.With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling verycross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possiblypass without bringing forward the same information again, or thesubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--forwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares ofhospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say toher,""We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to seetwo more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--andthen I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear metelling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank.I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within afortnight.""Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented tohis proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their partyquite complete.""He has been wanting to come to us,"" continued Mr. Weston, ""ever sinceSeptember: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command hisown time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (betweenourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week inJanuary.""""What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is soanxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy asyourself.""""Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does notknow the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(but this isquite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the otherroom. There are secrets in all families, you know)--The case is, that aparty of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; andthat Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are notput off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a familythat a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particulardislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once intwo or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeingFrank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself:but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table)has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them atHartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have beenlong in the practice of doing.""""I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,"" repliedEmma; ""but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think hewill come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.""""Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been atthe place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myselfto speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her to be veryfond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond ofany body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in herway--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thingto be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not sayit to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people ingeneral; and the devil of a temper.""Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--yetobserving, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to besecure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talkedof: ""for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine asMr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?""""Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.""""My Emma!"" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, ""what is the certaintyof caprice?"" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attendingbefore--""You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no meansso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his fatherthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; inshort, upon her temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture onthe truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-temperedwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.""""Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,"" replied Isabella:""and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatestcompassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, mustbe dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; butit must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had anychildren! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!""Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then haveheard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreservewhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchillsfrom her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her ownimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But atpresent there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soonfollowed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long afterdinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine norconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those withwhom he was always comfortable.While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity ofsaying,""And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any meanscertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.""""Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Evenif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid thatsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagineany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish onthe Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. Theyare jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel nodependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.""""He ought to come,"" said Emma. ""If he could stay only a couple of days,he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not havingit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall intobad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wantsto be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under suchrestraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if helikes it.""""One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, beforeone decides upon what he can do,"" replied Mrs. Weston. ""One ought touse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any oneindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly mustnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and everything gives way to her.""""But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now,according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, thatwhile she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom sheowes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_,she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owesnothing at all.""""My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understanda bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but itmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it willbe.""Emma listened, and then coolly said, ""I shall not be satisfied, unlesshe comes.""""He may have a great deal of influence on some points,"" continued Mrs.Weston, ""and on others, very little: and among those, on which she isbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance ofhis coming away from them to visit us."""
Emma,15,"CHAPTER XVMr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank histea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his threecompanions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness ofthe hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty andconvivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at lastthe drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in verygood spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emmawere sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and, withscarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind bythe expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his lateimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on hismaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with mostfriendly smiles.He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--her fair,lovely, amiable friend. ""Did she know?--had she heard any thing abouther, since their being at Randalls?--he felt much anxiety--he mustconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.""And in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not muchattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terrorof a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if hewere more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than onHarriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection, thanthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with greatearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamberagain, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to ventureinto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; andthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into itsproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitudeabout her. She was vexed. It did appear--there was no concealingit--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead ofHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs. Westonto implore her assistance, ""Would not she give him her support?--wouldnot she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to goto Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder hadno infection? He could not be satisfied without a promise--would not shegive him her influence in procuring it?""""So scrupulous for others,"" he continued, ""and yet so careless forherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, andyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sorethroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have not Isome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.""Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at anaddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right offirst interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked andoffended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thoughtmust restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to aseat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly didanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the roomfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the informationof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowingfast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.Woodhouse:""This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their waythrough a storm of snow.""Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body elsehad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Westonand Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from hisson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.""I admired your resolution very much, sir,"" said he, ""in venturing outin such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; andI dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow canhardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one isblown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the otherat hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.""Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that hehad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lestit should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for hishurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likelyto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid theywould find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable, thathe might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmostgood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from theconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.""What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?"" was Mr.Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for sometime. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, herrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and oftheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of beingblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was fullin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable foradventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eagerto have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls,while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possibleaccumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.""You had better order the carriage directly, my love,"" said she; ""I daresay we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if wedo come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at allafraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes,you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing thatgives me cold.""""Indeed!"" replied he. ""Then, my dear Isabella, it is the mostextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thingdoes give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home,I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.""Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma couldnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who hadleft the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine,and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in theirgetting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. Hehad gone beyond the sweep--some way along the Highbury road--the snowwas nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places hardly enough towhiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but theclouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soonover. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in therebeing nothing to apprehend.To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they werescarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, whowas immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervousconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not beappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued atRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returninghome, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; andwhile the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightleyand Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--""Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?""""I am ready, if the others are.""""Shall I ring the bell?""""Yes, do.""And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more,and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his ownhouse, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper andhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on suchoccasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewalof alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and thediscovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. ""He wasafraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabellawould not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.He did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much togetheras they could;"" and James was talked to, and given a charge to go veryslow and wait for the other carriage.Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that hedid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the secondcarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not have beenthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked tohim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed butone. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he hadbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that hewould want to be talking nonsense.To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she wasimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity ofthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had theypassed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found hersubject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded, and Mr. Eltonactually making violent love to her: availing himself of the preciousopportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known,hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him; butflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love andunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. Itreally was so. Without scruple--without apology--without much apparentdiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and sayit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve torestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly mustbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only tothe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and theplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, shereplied,""I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forgetyourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shallbe happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.""""Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possiblymean!""--And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, suchboastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying withquickness,""Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can accountfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speakeither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enoughto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.""But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not atall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; andhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, andslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--butacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--heresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for afavourable answer.As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of hisinconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,replied,""It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourselftoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I canexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the lastmonth, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the dailyhabit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is anunsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the objectof such professions.""""Good Heaven!"" cried Mr. Elton, ""what can be the meaning of this?--MissSmith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of myexistence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: nevercared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If shehas fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am verysorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse!who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon myhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only ofyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any oneelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, hasbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. Youcannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to beinsinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me.""It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--whichof all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completelyoverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silencebeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, hetried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed--""Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interestingsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.""""No, sir,"" cried Emma, ""it confesses no such thing. So far from havinglong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respectto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that youshould have been giving way to any feelings--Nothing could be fartherfrom my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your pursuit ofher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have beenvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were notyour attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judgedill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you havenever sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that youhave never thought seriously of her?""""Never, madam,"" cried he, affronted in his turn: ""never, I assure you._I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort ofgirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wishher extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not objectto--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equalalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--No, madam, myvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement Ireceived--""""Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirelymistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of myfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a commonacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistakeends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith mighthave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which youare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, Itrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.""He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invitesupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutuallydeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. Ifthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperateawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for thelittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriageturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before anothersyllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a goodnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, underindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, whohad been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from VicarageLane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--and instrange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed asif her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness andattention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of herfather, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin ofgruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and theday was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation; andit needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till theusual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection."
Emma,16,"CHAPTER XVIThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to thinkand be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrowof every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of everything most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worstof all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort orother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; andshe would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more inerror--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could theeffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.""If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could haveborne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me--but poorHarriet!""How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had neverthought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well asshe could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, shesupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, musthave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been somisled.The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--and thecharade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they hadseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its ""readywit""--but then the ""soft eyes""--in fact it suited neither; it wasa jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through suchthick-headed nonsense?Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners toherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mereerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among othersthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all thegentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to meanany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on thesubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denyingthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightleyhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given,the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marryindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of hischaracter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. Itwas dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in manyrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and littleconcerned about the feelings of others.Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay hisaddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and hisproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having thearrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she wasperfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need becared for. There had been no real affection either in his language ormanners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she couldhardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, lessallied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him. Heonly wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouseof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite soeasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebodyelse with twenty, or with ten.But--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as awareof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marryhim!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look downupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank belowhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing nopresumption in addressing her!--It was most provoking.Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was herinferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want ofsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know thatin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He mustknow that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations atHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that theEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly wasinconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, fromother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to DonwellAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses hadlong held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood whichMr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as hecould, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend himto notice but his situation and his civility.--But he had fancied herin love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; andafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle mannersand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stopand admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant andobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her realmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation anddelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right towonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistakenhers.The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it waswrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. Itwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of whatought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quiteconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.""Here have I,"" said she, ""actually talked poor Harriet into being verymuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but forme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I hadnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as Iused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her notto accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well doneof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time andchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her theopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to haveattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel thisdisappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any bodyelse who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, Icould not endure William Coxe--a pert young lawyer.""She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a moreserious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be,and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, andall that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness offuture meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing theacquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoidingeclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections sometime longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but theconviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporarygloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return ofspirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enoughto keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations ofsoftened pain and brighter hope.Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had goneto bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and todepend on getting tolerably out of it.It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really inlove with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking todisappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superiorsort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--and that therecould be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except thethree principals, and especially for her father's being given a moment'suneasiness about it.These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snowon the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome thatmight justify their all three being quite asunder at present.The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, shecould not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had hisdaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either excitingor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground coveredwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost andthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, everymorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in tofreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercoursewith Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday anymore than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton'sabsenting himself.It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and thoughshe hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some societyor other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied withhis being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and tohear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely fromthem,--""Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?""These days of confinement would have been, but for her privateperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suitedher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance tohis companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off hisill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during therest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and obliging,and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes ofcheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still suchan evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, asmade it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease."
Emma,17,"CHAPTER XVIIMr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. Theweather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to staybehind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole partyset off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poorIsabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doatedon, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocentlybusy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, withMr. Elton's best compliments, ""that he was proposing to leave Highburythe following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance withthe pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a fewweeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, fromvarious circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personalleave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should everretain a grateful sense--and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should behappy to attend to them.""Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at thistime was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contrivingit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which itwas announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken thanin a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.She had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was notmentioned;--and there was so striking a change in all this, and such anill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, asshe thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.It did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of sosudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely tothe end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was avery useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thoughtand conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhousetalked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them awaywith all her usual promptitude.She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reasonto believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable thatshe should have as much time as possible for getting the better ofher other complaint before the gentleman's return. She went to Mrs.Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessarypenance of communication; and a severe one it was.--She had to destroyall the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding--to appear inthe ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herselfgrossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, allher observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the lastsix weeks.The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight ofHarriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity withherself again.Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--and in everything testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinionof herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment toher friend.Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed onHarriet's side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as havingany thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Eltonwould have been too great a distinction.--She never could have deservedhim--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse wouldhave thought it possible.Her tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless, thatno dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--andshe listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart andunderstanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was thesuperior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would be more forher own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence coulddo.It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded andignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed ofbeing humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest ofher life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims, wasto promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affectionin some better method than by match-making. She got her to Hartfield,and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy andamuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from herthoughts.Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; andshe could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters ingeneral, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Eltonin particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might bemade towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, asto allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existenceof any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yetit appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against aninclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend itscontinuing very long in equal force.If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident andindubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could notimagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or therecollection of him.Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad foreach, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or ofeffecting any material change of society. They must encounter eachother, and make the best of it.Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and greatgirls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she couldhave any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation orrepellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure befound if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way ofcure, there could be no true peace for herself."
Emma,18,"CHAPTER XVIIIMr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs.Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. Forthe present, he could not be spared, to his ""very great mortificationand regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming toRandalls at no distant period.""Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, infact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young manhad been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for everexpecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes byany proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized andsorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or threemonths later would be a much better plan; better time of year;better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stayconsiderably longer with them than if he had come sooner.These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, ofa more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition ofexcuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband wasto suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr.Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted, rather, tobe quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that sheshould appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to expressas much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr.and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to theirfriendship.She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quiteas much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rathermore,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She thenproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage ofsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure oflooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which thesight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on theChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreementwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she wastaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and makinguse of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.""The Churchills are very likely in fault,"" said Mr. Knightley, coolly;""but I dare say he might come if he would.""""I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; buthis uncle and aunt will not spare him.""""I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made apoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.""""How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you supposehim such an unnatural creature?""""I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting thathe may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very littlefor any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who havealways set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural thanone could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud,luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. IfFrank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived itbetween September and January. A man at his age--what is he?--three orfour-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that.It is impossible.""""That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been yourown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of thedifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempersto manage.""""It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twentyshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot wantmoney--he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has somuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts inthe kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other. Alittle while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can leave theChurchills.""""Yes, sometimes he can.""""And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; wheneverthere is any temptation of pleasure.""""It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimateknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interiorof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of thatfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.Churchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephewcan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can atothers.""""There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, andthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour andresolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to hisfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if hewished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say atonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--'Every sacrifice ofmere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience;but I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt bymy failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion.I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'--If he would say so to herat once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be noopposition made to his going.""""No,"" said Emma, laughing; ""but perhaps there might be some made to hiscoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, touse!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But youhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite toyour own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that tothe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide forhim!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking asloud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable?""""Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. Hewould feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made, of course,as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--would do him moregood, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people hedepended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do.Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that they couldtrust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would dorightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all theworld must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; andwhile meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts notthinking the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect forright conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort ofmanner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds wouldbend to his.""""I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; butwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they havea knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as greatones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to betransported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation,you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending forhim; and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not havea word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of earlyobedience and long observance to break through. To him who has, it mightnot be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and setall their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have asstrong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being soequal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.""""Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equalexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.""""Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try tounderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directlyopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all hislife.""""Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the firstoccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against thewill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, offollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow forthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, heought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy intheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on theirside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, therewould have been no difficulty now.""""We shall never agree about him,"" cried Emma; ""but that is nothingextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man'sperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from someadvantages, it will secure him many others.""""Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, andof leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremelyexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fineflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuadehimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world ofpreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right tocomplain. His letters disgust me.""""Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.""""I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfya woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother'splace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on heraccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doublyfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, hewould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whetherhe did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort ofconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this toherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French,not in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good manners, and bevery agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelingsof other people: nothing really amiable about him.""""You seem determined to think ill of him.""""Me!--not at all,"" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; ""I do notwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his meritsas any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal;that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners.""""Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasureat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred andagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into thebargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ hiscoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout theparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--one object ofcuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speakof nobody else.""""You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find himconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only achattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.""""My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste ofevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universallyagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;and so on to every body, having that general information on all subjectswhich will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just aspropriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is myidea of him.""""And mine,"" said Mr. Knightley warmly, ""is, that if he turn out anything like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--thepractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and makeevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; tobe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear likefools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could notendure such a puppy when it came to the point.""""I will say no more about him,"" cried Emma, ""you turn every thing toevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have nochance of agreeing till he is really here.""""Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.""""But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love forMr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.""""He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,"" saidMr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediatelytalk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should beangry.To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of adifferent disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality ofmind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all thehigh opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she hadnever before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the meritof another.VOLUME II"
Emma,19,"CHAPTER IEmma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma'sopinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She couldnot think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; andshe was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as theyreturned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, andreceiving no other answer than a very plaintive--""Mr. Elton is so goodto the poor!"" she found something else must be done.They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There wasalways sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Batesloved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very fewwho presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent inthat respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock oftheir scanty comforts.She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasionof its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--andall the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate andthird-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and thereforeshe seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden resolution of notpassing their door without going in--observing, as she proposed it toHarriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quitesafe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupiedthe drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and evengratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting wasseated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place toMiss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost readyto overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit,solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse'shealth, cheerful communications about her mother's, and sweet-cake fromthe beaufet--""Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for tenminutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and _she_ hadtaken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much;and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do themthe favour to eat a piece too.""The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Eltonsince his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have theletter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how muchhe was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went,and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she wentthrough it very well, with all the interest and all the commendationthat could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet'sbeing obliged to say a word.This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded byany troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistressesand Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not beenprepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actuallyhurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly tothe Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.""Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--Mrs. Colewas telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--Mrs. Cole was sokind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon asshe came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great afavourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how toshew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as muchas any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying,'I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not hertime for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, wehad a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any bodymore surprized. 'Have you, upon your honour?' said she; 'well, that isquite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.'""Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--""Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. Ihope she is well?""""Thank you. You are so kind!"" replied the happily deceived aunt, whileeagerly hunting for the letter.--""Oh! here it is. I was sure it couldnot be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without beingaware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very latelythat I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs.Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, forit is such a pleasure to her--a letter from Jane--that she can neverhear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is,only just under my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hearwhat she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice toJane, apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages yousee--hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosseshalf. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She oftensays, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, Hetty, now I thinkyou will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--don't you,ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it outherself, if she had nobody to do it for her--every word of it--I am sureshe would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed,though my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she can seeamazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is sucha blessing! My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often says,when she is here, 'I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strongeyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--Ionly wish my eyes may last me as well.'""All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of MissFairfax's handwriting.""You are extremely kind,"" replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; ""you whoare such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there isnobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's.My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma'am,""addressing her, ""do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to sayabout Jane's handwriting?""And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeatedtwice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She waspondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming veryrude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almostresolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when MissBates turned to her again and seized her attention.""My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all. Byonly raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is veryremarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at alldeafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at mymother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, sinceshe was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and asI was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of hernow.""""Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?""""Oh yes; next week.""""Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.""""Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is sosurprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure shewill be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to seeher. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because ColonelCampbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So verygood of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you know. Ohyes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about. That isthe reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in thecommon course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday orWednesday.""""Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of myhearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.""""So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not beenfor this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. Mymother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us atleast. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have thepleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells aregoing to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to comeover and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till thesummer, but she is so impatient to see them again--for till she married,last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which mustmake it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letterto her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, butwe shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's name aswell as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they wouldgive them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their countryseat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a greatdeal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--I do not know that she everheard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know,that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying hisaddresses--and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them--forColonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter'snot walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at allblame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling MissCampbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us wordthat he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he hadtaken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Janewas quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things.""At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma'sbrain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and thenot going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of fartherdiscovery,""You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed tocome to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendshipbetween her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to beexcused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.""""Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always beenrather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such adistance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing wasto happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They wanther (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressingthan their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He isa most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane atWeymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by thesudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would havebeen dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if hehad not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had thehistory of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!""""But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish of seeingIreland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?""""Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Coloneland Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they shouldrecommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her nativeair, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.""""I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, hasno remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to becompared with Miss Fairfax.""""Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutelyplain--but extremely elegant and amiable.""""Yes, that of course.""""Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November,(as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A longtime, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentionedit before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! soconsiderate!--But however, she is so far from well, that her kindfriends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an airthat always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or fourmonths at Highbury will entirely cure her--and it is certainly a greatdeal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she isunwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.""""It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.""""And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbellsleave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you willfind from Jane's letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback ofher illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, andlooking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened tome, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane's letters throughto myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, forfear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired meto do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than Iburst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--whichmy mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmedat. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I hadfancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she doesnot think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off myguard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. Theexpense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and sofond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing forattendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife andfamily to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now Ihave just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn toher letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal betterthan I can tell it for her.""""I am afraid we must be running away,"" said Emma, glancing at Harriet,and beginning to rise--""My father will be expecting us. I had nointention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would notpass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been sopleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates goodmorning.""And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regainedthe street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on heragainst her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance ofJane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself."
Emma,20,"CHAPTER IIJane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngestdaughter.The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ----regiment of infantry,and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hopeand interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholyremembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking underconsumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, onlosing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation,the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed everyprobability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taughtonly what very limited means could command, and growing up with noadvantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on whatnature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, andwarm-hearted, well-meaning relations.But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a changeto her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regardedFairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; andfarther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severecamp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims whichhe did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from thedeath of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing inhis power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took noticeof her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, aboutJane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits andgrowing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, hisdaughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a realfriend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertakingthe whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that periodJane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with thementirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; thevery few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father makingindependence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of ColonelCampbell's power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, washandsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter's;but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means ofrespectable subsistence hereafter.Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She had fallen into good hands, knownnothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellenteducation. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people,her heart and understanding had received every advantage of disciplineand culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, everylighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance offirst-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were equally worthyof all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was,as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was toomuch beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote,and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It waseasy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained withthem, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures ofan elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, withonly the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her owngood understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of MissCampbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party fromthe circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty andacquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseenby the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by theparents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till themarriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so oftendefies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what ismoderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections ofMr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they wereacquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax hadyet her bread to earn.This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to beyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her pathof duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment hadfixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twentyshould be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she hadresolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire fromall the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peaceand hope, to penance and mortification for ever.The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose sucha resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, noexertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and fortheir own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this wouldbe selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps theybegan to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted thetemptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoymentsof ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurryingon the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time oftheir daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recoveredher usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, sofar from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require somethingmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged withtolerable comfort.With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to heraunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truthsnot told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence toHighbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty withthose kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, ortreble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that theydepended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recoveryof her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she was tocome; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty whichhad been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for thepresent with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a twoyears' absence.Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not likethrough three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished,and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be adifficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it wasbecause she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which shewanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerlyrefuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in whichher conscience could not quite acquit her. But ""she could never getacquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was suchcoldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased ornot--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was madesuch a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined thatthey were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, everybody had supposed they must be so fond of each other."" These were herreasons--she had no better.It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnifiedby fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after anyconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; andnow, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance andmanners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. JaneFairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself thehighest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almostevery body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; herfigure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, betweenfat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to pointout the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; andthen, her face--her features--there was more beauty in them altogetherthan she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasingbeauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, hadnever been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used tocavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which reallyneeded no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance wasthe reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all herprinciples, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,and merit.In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax withtwofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of renderingjustice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. Whenshe took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she wasgoing to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossibleto feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to everywell-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highlyprobable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she hadso naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be morepitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon'sactions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imaginationhad suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,successless love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciouslysucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with herfriend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now bedenying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herselfeffectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career oflaborious duty.Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highburyafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that shecould wish to scheme about for her.These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committedherself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax,or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, thansaying to Mr. Knightley, ""She certainly is handsome; she is better thanhandsome!"" Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmotherand aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; moretiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admirationof her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly howlittle bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a sliceof mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and newworkbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praisewhich necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, anair of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own verysuperior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, socold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up ina cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She wasdisgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved onthe subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed benton giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own valuefor his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was allgeneral approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma sawits artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably _was_something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed onlyto Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchillhad been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were alittle acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emmaprocure as to what he truly was. ""Was he handsome?""--""She believedhe was reckoned a very fine young man."" ""Was he agreeable?""--""He wasgenerally thought so."" ""Did he appear a sensible young man; a youngman of information?""--""At a watering-place, or in a common Londonacquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners wereall that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge thanthey had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found hismanners pleasing."" Emma could not forgive her."
Emma,21,"CHAPTER IIIEmma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentmentwere discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and hadseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he wasexpressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business withMr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he mighthave done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enoughto be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her unjust toJane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.""A very pleasant evening,"" he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had beentalked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papersswept away;--""particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us somevery good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sittingat one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women;sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure MissFairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothingundone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrumentat her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.""""I am happy you approved,"" said Emma, smiling; ""but I hope I am notoften deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.""""No, my dear,"" said her father instantly; ""_that_ I am sure you are not.There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing,you are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handedround once, I think it would have been enough.""""No,"" said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; ""you are not oftendeficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. Ithink you understand me, therefore.""An arch look expressed--""I understand you well enough;"" but she saidonly, ""Miss Fairfax is reserved.""""I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome allthat part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has itsfoundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.""""You think her diffident. I do not see it.""""My dear Emma,"" said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,""you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasantevening.""""Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; andamused to think how little information I obtained.""""I am disappointed,"" was his only answer.""I hope every body had a pleasant evening,"" said Mr. Woodhouse, in hisquiet way. ""I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then Imoved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, thoughshe speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss JaneFairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and avery well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the eveningagreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.""""True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.""Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for thepresent, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--""She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.""Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared toexpress; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whosethoughts were on the Bates's, said--""It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! agreat pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one canventure to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--Now wehave killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any otherpork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sureof their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, withoutthe smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roastpork--I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so, my dear?""""My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, andthe loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.""""That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, butthat is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if itis not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serleboils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and alittle carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.""""Emma,"" said Mr. Knightley presently, ""I have a piece of news for you.You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think willinterest you.""""News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you smileso?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?""He had time only to say,""No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,"" when the door wasthrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Fullof thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest.Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not anothersyllable of communication could rest with him.""Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse--Icome quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! Youare too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to bemarried.""Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was socompletely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and alittle blush, at the sound.""There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,"" said Mr.Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of whathad passed between them.""But where could _you_ hear it?"" cried Miss Bates. ""Where could youpossibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since Ireceived Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at leastten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out--Iwas only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane wasstanding in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was soafraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I wouldgo down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead? for I thinkyou have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--'Oh!my dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note. A MissHawkins--that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley,how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole toldMrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins--""""I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had justread Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.""""Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news moregenerally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. Mymother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousandthanks, and says you really quite oppress her.""""We consider our Hartfield pork,"" replied Mr. Woodhouse--""indeed itcertainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannothave a greater pleasure than--""""Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too goodto us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealththemselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.We may well say that 'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr.Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--""""It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.""--Here was a sly glance at Emma. ""He had been so fortunate as to--I forgetthe precise words--one has no business to remember them. The informationwas, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. Byhis style, I should imagine it just settled.""""Mr. Elton going to be married!"" said Emma, as soon as she could speak.""He will have every body's wishes for his happiness.""""He is very young to settle,"" was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. ""He hadbetter not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. Wewere always glad to see him at Hartfield.""""A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!"" said Miss Bates, joyfully;""my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot bear to have the poor oldVicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you havenever seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to seehim.""Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly tooccupy her.""No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,"" she replied, starting on this appeal;""is he--is he a tall man?""""Who shall answer that question?"" cried Emma. ""My father would say'yes,' Mr. Knightley 'no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just thehappy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection inHighbury, both in person and mind.""""Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best youngman--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday hewas precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, anexcellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother--wantingher to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for mymother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she does nothear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. Hefancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--but she says it didhim no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. Itis such a happiness when good people get together--and they always do.Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,such very good people; and the Perrys--I suppose there never was ahappier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,"" turningto Mr. Woodhouse, ""I think there are few places with such society asHighbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dearsir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it ispork--a roast loin of pork--""""As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquaintedwith her,"" said Emma, ""nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that itcannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four weeks.""Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,Emma said,""You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take an interestin this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of lateon these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on MissCampbell's account--we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.Elton and Miss Hawkins.""""When I have seen Mr. Elton,"" replied Jane, ""I dare say I shall beinterested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is somemonths since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little wornoff.""""Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,""said Miss Bates, ""four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I hadalways rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not thatI ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said, 'No, Mr.Elton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do not think I amparticularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it.What is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder ifMr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, sogood-humouredly. She knows I would not offend for the world. How doesMiss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs.John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do youknow I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean inperson--tall, and with that sort of look--and not very talkative.""""Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.""""Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, isnot, strictly speaking, handsome?""""Handsome! Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain. I told you he wasplain.""""My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,and that you yourself--""""Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard,I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed thegeneral opinion, when I called him plain.""""Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather doesnot look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, mydear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a mostagreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's;but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go homedirectly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is thebetter for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall notattempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares forany thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be anotherthing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is comingtoo. Well, that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will beso kind as to give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Goodmorning to you.""Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him whilehe lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and tomarry strangers too--and the other half she could give to her own viewof the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome pieceof news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but shewas sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hopewas, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearingit abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was likelyto call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon itsbeginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather wouldbe detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence wouldundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look whichhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the ""Oh! MissWoodhouse, what do you think has happened!"" which instantly burst forth,had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow wasgiven, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than inlistening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had totell. ""She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--she hadbeen afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour downevery moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--shehad hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by thehouse where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought shewould just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seemto stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast asshe could, and took shelter at Ford's.""--Ford's was the principalwoollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shopfirst in size and fashion in the place.--""And so, there she hadset, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it wasso very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--who should come in, butElizabeth Martin and her brother!--Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. Ithought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sittingnear the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busywith the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly,and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of theshop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!I am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go awayyou know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in theworld but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, helooked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, theybegan whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; andI could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(doyou think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--camequite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; Icould see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be veryfriendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know nomore what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said shewas sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, MissWoodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning tohold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from gettingaway--and then--only think!--I found he was coming up towards metoo--slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; andso he came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feelingdreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, andsaid it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not gotthree yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I wasgoing to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole'sstables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I wasvery much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he wentback to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--butI hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly andso kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me andmake me comfortable again.""Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately inher power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughlycomfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemedthe result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harrietdescribed it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affectionand genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed them to bewell-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this makein the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Ofcourse, he must be sorry to lose her--they must be all sorry. Ambition,as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hopedto rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value ofHarriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--whatsignified her praise?She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by consideringall that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelton,""It might be distressing, for the moment,"" said she; ""but you seem tohave behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never,as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think aboutit.""Harriet said, ""very true,"" and she ""would not think about it;"" but stillshe talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, atlast, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurryon the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution;hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or onlyamused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion ofMr. Elton's importance with her!Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feelthe first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hourbefore, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversationwas over, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity,wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins,which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination inher fancy.Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. Ithad been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining anyinfluence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not getat her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either thecourage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of thebrother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonthmight pass without their being thrown together again, with anynecessity, or even any power of speech."
Emma,22,"CHAPTER IVHuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interestingsituations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure ofbeing kindly spoken of.A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned inHighbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to haveevery recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highlyaccomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrivedto triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits,there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her Christianname, and say whose music she principally played.Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected andmortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of whatappeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the rightlady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. Hehad gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged to another--andto another as superior, of course, to the first, as under suchcircumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back gayand self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse,and defying Miss Smith.The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages ofperfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of somedignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had notthrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts;and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--the first hour ofintroduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice;the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progressof the affair was so glorious--the steps so quick, from the accidentalrencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs.Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--with consciousness andagitation richly scattered--the lady had been so easily impressed--sosweetly disposed--had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase,been so very ready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equallycontented.He had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, andwas just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself andhis own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughedat--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the youngladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been morecautiously gallant.The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves toplease, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; andwhen he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, whicha certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when henext entered Highbury he would bring his bride.During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enoughto feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the impressionof his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, nowspread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very much to wonderthat she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his sight was soinseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that,except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitablehumiliation to her own mind, she would have been thankful to be assuredof never seeing him again. She wished him very well; but he gaveher pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer mostsatisfaction.The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, mustcertainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would beprevented--many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ wouldbe an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sinkwithout remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civilityagain.Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good enoughfor Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--handsomeenough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to connexion,there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vauntedclaims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On that article,truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_she was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did notappear that she was at all Harriet's superior. She brought no name, noblood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughtersof a Bristol--merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the wholeof the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, itwas not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been verymoderate also. Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though thefather and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--in the lawline--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, thanthat he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived. Emmaguessed him to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise.And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the eldersister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_, to a gentleman in a _great__way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of thehistory; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She hadtalked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked outof it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet'smind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; hecertainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martinwould have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cureher. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be alwaysin love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from thisreappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of himsomewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times everyday Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him,_just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have somethingoccur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth ofsurprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually hearing abouthim; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always among those whosaw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting asthe discussion of his concerns; and every report, therefore, everyguess--all that had already occurred, all that might occur in thearrangement of his affairs, comprehending income, servants, andfurniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her regard wasreceiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets keptalive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of MissHawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he seemedattached!--his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of hishat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to herfriend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind,Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Eltonpredominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally usefulas a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure ofthe agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by theknowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by ElizabethMartin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet hadnot been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, writtenin the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a greatdeal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been muchoccupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, inperson, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the Martins wereforgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again,Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it bestfor her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--andwhat might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, wouldbe ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of theacquaintance--!After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, thanHarriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they hadunderstanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formalacquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at theAbbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her againso soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerousrecurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degreeof intimacy was chosen for the future.She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in itwhich her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merelyglossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?"
Emma,23,"CHAPTER VSmall heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before herfriend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led herto the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation ofbeing lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to wherethe coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunkand the direction, was consequently a blank.She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to beput down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led betweenespalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing whichhad given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning torevive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed herto be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determinedher not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant whowas married, and settled in Donwell.The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, andunattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down thegravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting withher seemingly with ceremonious civility.Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She wasfeeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough tounderstand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received herdoubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace hadbeen talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs. Martin'ssaying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, hadbrought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that veryroom she had been measured last September, with her two friends. Therewere the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window._He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour,the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the sameregrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and theywere just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect,as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriagereappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortnessof it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be givento those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six monthsago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they mightresent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. Shewould have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have hadthe Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could shehave done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent. They must beseparated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so muchto herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a littleconsolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls toprocure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. Therefreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither""master nor mistress was at home;"" they had both been out some time; theman believed they were gone to Hartfield.""This is too bad,"" cried Emma, as they turned away. ""And now we shalljust miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been sodisappointed."" And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge hermurmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such beingthe commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriagestopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who werestanding to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight ofthem, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Westonimmediately accosted her with,""How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--gladto see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter thismorning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he is atOxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would beso. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; Iwas always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to havejust the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shallenjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we couldwish.""There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding theinfluence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all wasby the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but notless to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain wasenough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice intheir joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and inthe rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would nowbe talked of no more.Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, whichallowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command,as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened,and smiled, and congratulated.""I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,"" said he, at the conclusion.Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from hiswife.""We had better move on, Mr. Weston,"" said she, ""we are detaining thegirls.""""Well, well, I am ready;""--and turning again to Emma, ""but you mustnot be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have onlyhad _my_ account you know; I dare say he is really nothingextraordinary:""--though his own sparkling eyes at the moment werespeaking a very different conviction.Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in amanner that appropriated nothing.""Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,"" was Mrs.Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant onlyfor her.""Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,"" was Mr.Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing worea different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish asbefore. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at leastmust soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she sawsomething like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.""Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?""--was aquestion, however, which did not augur much.But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emmawas now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithfulpupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, thatshe was to think of her at four.""My dear, dear anxious friend,""--said she, in mental soliloquy, whilewalking downstairs from her own room, ""always overcareful for everybody's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,going again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.""The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. ""'Tis twelve;I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by thistime to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of thepossibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring himsoon.""She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with herfather--Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a fewminutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank'sbeing a day before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of hisvery civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have hershare of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actuallybefore her--he was presented to her, and she did not think too much hadbeen said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young man; height,air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a greatdeal of the spirit and liveliness of his father's; he looked quick andsensible. She felt immediately that she should like him; and there wasa well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced herthat he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquaintedthey soon must be.He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with theeagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travelearlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.""I told you yesterday,"" cried Mr. Weston with exultation, ""I told youall that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what Iused to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot helpgetting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming inupon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great dealmore than any little exertion it needs.""""It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,"" said the youngman, ""though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.""The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; theconviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleasedwith Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardlyallow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk toHighbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himselfto have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none butone's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. Thathe should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were afalsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner hadno air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if in astate of no common enjoyment.Their subjects in general were such as belong to an openingacquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,--""Was she ahorsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--Pleasant walks?--Had they a largeneighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There wereseveral very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Wasit a musical society?""But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintanceproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, whiletheir two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing hismother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so muchwarm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to hisfather, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an additionalproof of his knowing how to please--and of his certainly thinking itworth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word of praisebeyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but,undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He understoodwhat would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. ""His father'smarriage,"" he said, ""had been the wisest measure, every friend mustrejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessingmust be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation onhim.""He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things itwas to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse'scharacter, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as ifresolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to itsobject, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty ofher person.""Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,"" said he; ""but Iconfess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than avery tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know thatI was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.""""You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,""said Emma; ""were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen withpleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using suchwords. Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a prettyyoung woman.""""I hope I should know better,"" he replied; ""no, depend upon it, (with agallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whomI might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in myterms.""Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected fromtheir knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind,had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be consideredas marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must see moreof him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they wereagreeable.She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quickeye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happyexpression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she wasconfident that he was often listening.Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, theentire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther fromapproving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--Though always objectingto every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand fromthe apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill ofany two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till itwere proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He couldnow, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without aglance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to allhis natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evilsof sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixedanxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold--which,however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself tillafter another night.A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--""He must be going.He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands forMrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else."" His son,too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,""As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunityof paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and thereforemay as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted witha neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or nearHighbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is notthe proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know anyfamily of that name?""""To be sure we do,"" cried his father; ""Mrs. Bates--we passed herhouse--I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquaintedwith Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girlshe is. Call upon her, by all means.""""There is no necessity for my calling this morning,"" said the young man;""another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintanceat Weymouth which--""""Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be donecannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You sawher with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixedwith, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enoughto live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.""The son looked convinced.""I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,"" said Emma; ""she is a veryelegant young woman.""He agreed to it, but with so quiet a ""Yes,"" as inclined her almost todoubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sortof elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thoughtonly ordinarily gifted with it.""If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,"" said she,""I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her andhear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has anaunt who never holds her tongue.""""You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?"" said Mr.Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; ""then giveme leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable younglady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, veryworthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremelyglad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you toshew you the way.""""My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.""""But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great manyhouses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where youhad best cross the street.""Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, ""My good friend,this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he seesit, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,step, and jump.""They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and agraceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remainedvery well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could nowengage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with fullconfidence in their comfort."
Emma,24,"CHAPTER VIThe next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He hadbeen sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, tillher usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk,immediately fixed on Highbury.--""He did not doubt there being verypleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should alwayschuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,would be his constant attraction.""--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stoodfor Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction withhim. They walked thither directly.Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in forhalf a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knewnothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm inarm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him incompany with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of himwas to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amendsfor it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. Itwas not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid hisduty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner toher--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her asa friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emmato form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest ofthe morning. They were all three walking about together for an houror two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwardsin Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfieldsufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther wasresolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the wholevillage, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener thanEmma could have supposed.Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. Hebegged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, andwhich had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting thatan old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest ofher cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though insome points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, theyshewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which mustbe very like a merit to those he was with.Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, itcould not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absentinghimself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade ofinsincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done himjustice.Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, thoughthe principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horseswere kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from anyrun on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained byany interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history ofthe large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago fora ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularlypopulous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but suchbrilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose forwhich it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club establishedamong the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediatelyinterested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead ofpassing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashedwindows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no faultin the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, itwas long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold thevery number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least everyfortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revivedthe former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing inHighbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the convictionthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be temptedto attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not bepersuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, couldnot furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particularswere given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit thatthe inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that therewould be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into theirproper place the next morning. He argued like a young man very much benton dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution ofthe Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.He seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and socialinclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve ofEnscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; hisindifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance ofmind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.It was but an effusion of lively spirits.At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emmarecollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he hadpaid it.""Yes, oh! yes""--he replied; ""I was just going to mention it. A verysuccessful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very muchobliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had takenme quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, Iwas only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minuteswould have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; andI had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--but therewas no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I hadbeen actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.""""And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?""""Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to lookill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladiescan never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally sopale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--A mostdeplorable want of complexion.""Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax'scomplexion. ""It was certainly never brilliant, but she would notallow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness anddelicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character ofher face."" He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he hadheard many people say the same--but yet he must confess, that to himnothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Wherefeatures were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all;and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need notattempt to describe what the effect was.""Well,"" said Emma, ""there is no disputing about taste.--At least youadmire her except her complexion.""He shook his head and laughed.--""I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and hercomplexion.""""Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?""At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,""Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day oftheir lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, hesays, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may provemyself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I mustbuy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--I dare saythey sell gloves.""""Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You willbe adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, becauseyou were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and yourpopularity will stand upon your own virtues.""They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of ""Men's Beavers""and ""York Tan"" were bringing down and displaying on the counter, hesaid--""But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor__patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch ofpublic fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness inprivate life.""""I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and herparty at Weymouth.""""And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be avery unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degreeof acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--Ishall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.""""Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. Buther account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so veryreserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about anybody, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintancewith her.""""May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me sowell. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells alittle in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,warm-hearted woman. I like them all.""""You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she isdestined to be?""""Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.""""You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,"" said Mrs. Weston smiling;""remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to saywhen you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a littlefarther off.""""I certainly do forget to think of _her_,"" said Emma, ""as having everbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.""He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, ""Didyou ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?"" said FrankChurchill.""Ever hear her!"" repeated Emma. ""You forget how much she belongs toHighbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.She plays charmingly.""""You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one whocould really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, withconsiderable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--I amexcessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or rightof judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear her'sadmired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--aman, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged toher--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other womanto sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit downinstead--never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.""""Proof indeed!"" said Emma, highly amused.--""Mr. Dixon is very musical,is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.""""Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it avery strong proof.""""Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal strongerthan, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeableto me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more earthan eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?""""It was her very particular friend, you know.""""Poor comfort!"" said Emma, laughing. ""One would rather have a strangerpreferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it mightnot recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friendalways at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--PoorMrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.""""You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but shereally did not seem to feel it.""""So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. Butbe it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, ordulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have feltit: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerousdistinction.""""As to that--I do not--""""Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax'ssensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no humanbeing, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever shewas asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.""""There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--""he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, ""however, it isimpossible for me to say on what terms they really were--how it mightall be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothnessoutwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must bea better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conductherself in critical situations, than I can be.""""I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been childrenand women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should beintimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visitedher friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; alittle, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to takedisgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was,by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve--Inever could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.""""It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,"" said he. ""Oftentimes veryconvenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.""""Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attractionmay be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or anagreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble ofconquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between MissFairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to thinkill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetualcautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct ideaabout any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something toconceal.""He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, andthinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He wasnot exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in someof his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore betterthan she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate--his feelingswarmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr.Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at,and would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could notbelieve it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied forhaving. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could notthink any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ampleroom in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead whowanted more.Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how manyadvantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be nojudge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma,in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talkingabout, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early inlife, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not be aware of theinroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, ora bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombecould not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he wouldwillingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment."
Emma,25,"CHAPTER VIIEmma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken thefollowing day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to havehis hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, andhe had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner,but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut.There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice overon such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in itwhich she could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality ofplan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart,which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity,extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must bedoing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of hisfather and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appearin general; he became liable to all these charges. His father onlycalled him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs.Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over asquickly as possible, and making no other comment than that ""all youngpeople would have their little whims.""With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visithitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Westonwas very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he madehimself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. Heappeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful andlively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great dealdecidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond oftalking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he wereleft to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, heacknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always tospeak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but forsuch an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing todenote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imaginationhad given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her,of being at least very near it, and saved only by her ownindifference--(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--thehonour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their jointacquaintance.Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which musthave some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired herextremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with somuch to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge himharshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, ""all young people would have theirlittle whims.""There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not soleniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes ofDonwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were madefor the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled sooften and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to besoftened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he wassilent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself,over a newspaper he held in his hand, ""Hum! just the trifling, sillyfellow I took him for."" She had half a mind to resent; but an instant'sobservation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve hisown feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. andMrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularlyopportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emmawant their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactlythe advice they gave.This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years inHighbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, andunpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping littlecompany, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two hadbrought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town hadyielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. Withtheir wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, theirinclination for more company. They added to their house, to their numberof servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every bodyfor their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among thesingle men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emmacould hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, norHartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if they did;and she regretted that her father's known habits would be givingher refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were veryrespectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was notfor them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visitthem. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only fromherself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeksbefore it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found hervery differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received theirinvitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.Weston's accounting for it with ""I suppose they will not take theliberty with you; they know you do not dine out,"" was not quitesufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power ofrefusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurredagain and again, she did not know that she might not have been temptedto accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. Theyhad been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Mightnot the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The barepossibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; andher being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to beintended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were atHartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her firstremark, on reading it, was that ""of course it must be declined,"" she sovery soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that theiradvice for her going was most prompt and successful.She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutelywithout inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves soproperly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so muchconsideration for her father. ""They would have solicited the honourearlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen fromLondon, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught ofair, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honourof his company."" Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it beingbriefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglectinghis comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might bedepended on for bearing him company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talkedinto an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day nownear at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for _his_going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would betoo late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.""I am not fond of dinner-visiting,"" said he--""I never was. No more isEmma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Coleshould have done it. I think it would be much better if they would comein one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take usin their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are soreasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of theevening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose anybody to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dinewith them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to takecare of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be whatit ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy."" Then turning to Mrs.Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--""Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had notmarried, you would have staid at home with me.""""Well, sir,"" cried Mr. Weston, ""as I took Miss Taylor away, it isincumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.""But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better howto allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberatelyarranged.With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talkingas usual. ""He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regardfor Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. Jamescould take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer writtento Mrs. Cole.""""You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will saythat I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must declinetheir obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of course.But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to bedone. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will bewanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have neverbeen there above once since the new approach was made; but still I haveno doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there,you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again;and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late.You will get very tired when tea is over.""""But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?""""Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great manypeople talking at once. You will not like the noise.""""But, my dear sir,"" cried Mr. Weston, ""if Emma comes away early, it willbe breaking up the party.""""And no great harm if it does,"" said Mr. Woodhouse. ""The sooner everyparty breaks up, the better.""""But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's goingaway directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-naturedpeople, and think little of their own claims; but still they mustfeel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and MissWoodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's inthe room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I amsure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who havebeen your neighbours these _ten_ years.""""No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged toyou for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them anypain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Colenever touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, buthe is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the meansof giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay alittle longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. Youwill be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.""""Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have noscruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I amonly afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not beingexceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, youknow; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up byyourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea ofthat would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to situp.""He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that,if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; ifhungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid shouldsit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that everything were safe in the house, as usual."
Emma,26,"CHAPTER VIIIFrank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinnerwaiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxiousfor his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfectionwhich could be concealed.He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a verygood grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he haddone. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusionof face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits.He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him,Emma thus moralised to herself:--""I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly thingsdo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudentway. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.--Itdepends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done thisdifferently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, orbeen ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation ofa coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its ownvanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.""With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and fora longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and byinference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessinghow soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who werenow seeing them together for the first time.She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more thanhis propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she leftthe house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together afterdinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of herdress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helpingthem to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whateverunwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obligedthem to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinnerfor them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eatit.She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to seethat it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, andindependence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could,and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm fromher heart, for he stopped to hand her out.""This is coming as you should do,"" said she; ""like a gentleman.--I amquite glad to see you.""He thanked her, observing, ""How lucky that we should arrive at the samemoment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whetheryou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--Youmight not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.""""Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look ofconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to bebeneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, butwith you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I alwaysobserve it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_ you havenothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. Youare not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_ I shall reallybe very happy to walk into the same room with you.""""Nonsensical girl!"" was his reply, but not at all in anger.Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party aswith Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which couldnot but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for.When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest ofadmiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approachedher with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,and at dinner she found him seated by her--and, as she firmly believed,not without some dexterity on his side.The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a properunobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage ofnaming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in theevening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already,at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to begeneral; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma couldfairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour.The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, wasthe name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something ofher that was expected to be very interesting. She listened, and foundit well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy,received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had beencalling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room hadbeen struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant lookinginstrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and thesubstance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued ofsurprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanationson Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived fromBroadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt andniece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account,Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who couldpossibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfiedthat it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be fromColonel Campbell.""One can suppose nothing else,"" added Mrs. Cole, ""and I was onlysurprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence asany reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuseto surprize her.""Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on thesubject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there wereenough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and stilllisten to Mrs. Cole.""I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given memore satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, whoplays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quitea shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fineinstruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselvesa slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole,I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in thedrawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our littlegirls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing ofit; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has notany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest oldspinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this toMr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is soparticularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himselfin the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be soobliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and thatreally is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am surewe ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhousemay be prevailed with to try it this evening.""Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothingmore was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turnedto Frank Churchill.""Why do you smile?"" said she.""Nay, why do you?""""Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so richand so liberal.--It is a handsome present.""""Very.""""I rather wonder that it was never made before.""""Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.""""Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--which mustnow be shut up in London, untouched by any body.""""That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.Bates's house.""""You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.""""I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit foracuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probablysuspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see whatthere is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who canbe?""""What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?""""Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She mustknow as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; andperhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a youngwoman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. Itold you that your suspicions would guide mine.""""If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon inthem.""""Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be thejoint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, youknow, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.""""Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I hadentertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentionsof either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting eitherthat, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortuneto fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a littleattachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without guessingexactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause forher chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbellsto Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance;there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying hernative air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it mighthave passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in themonths of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages wouldbe much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I daresay in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, thoughyou make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you whatthey are.""""And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon'spreference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for being verydecided.""""And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?--A waterparty; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.""""He did. I was there--one of the party.""""Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for itseems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think I shouldhave made some discoveries.""""I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, thatMiss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caughther.--It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock andalarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it washalf an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was toogeneral a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to beobservable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have madediscoveries.""The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to sharein the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, andobliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the tablewas again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactlyright, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,""The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to knowa little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shallsoon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.""""And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we mustconclude it to come from the Campbells.""""No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it isnot from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. Shewould not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not haveconvinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.Dixon is a principal in the business.""""Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasoningscarry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposedyou satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only aspaternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that itshould be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it inno other light than as an offering of love.""There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemedreal; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other subjectstook their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessertsucceeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid theusual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downrightsilly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor theother--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news,and heavy jokes.The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the otherladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entreeof her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in herdignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness andthe artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so manyalleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointedaffection. There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears shehad been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself andseeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and saynothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfaxdid look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have beenglad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased themortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton invain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herselfbeloved by the husband of her friend.In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in thesecret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, thesubject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush ofconsciousness with which congratulations were received, the blushof guilt which accompanied the name of ""my excellent friend ColonelCampbell.""Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interestedby the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at herperseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask andto say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wishof saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in thefair heroine's countenance.They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very firstof the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and thehandsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Batesand her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, wouldnot sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.She was his object, and every body must perceive it. She introduced himto her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heardwhat each thought of the other. ""He had never seen so lovely a face, andwas delighted with her naivete."" And she, ""Only to be sure it was payinghim too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks alittle like Mr. Elton."" Emma restrained her indignation, and only turnedfrom her in silence.Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on firstglancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hatedsitting long--was always the first to move when he could--that hisfather, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy overparish business--that as long as he had staid, however, it had beenpleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike,sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought itso abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel she had beenused to despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to thesociety in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe,and the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far asEnscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that theirvisitings were among a range of great families, none very near; andthat even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an evenchance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, thoughhe had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, withoutconsiderable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away, or introducean acquaintance for a night.She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken atits best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement athome than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He didnot boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded hisaunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticingit, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could_with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on whichhis influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much togo abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but shewould not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he said,he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to begood behaviour to his father.""I have made a most wretched discovery,"" said he, after a short pause.--""I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time. I never knew days flyso fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself.But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--I hate therecollection.""""Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, outof so few, in having your hair cut.""""No,"" said he, smiling, ""that is no subject of regret at all. I haveno pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to beseen.""The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herselfobliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. WhenMr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before,she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at MissFairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.""What is the matter?"" said she.He started. ""Thank you for rousing me,"" he replied. ""I believe I havebeen very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd away--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never sawany thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own. Isee nobody else looking like her!--I must go and ask her whether itis an Irish fashion. Shall I?--Yes, I will--I declare I will--and youshall see how she takes it;--whether she colours.""He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before MissFairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly infront of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.""This is the luxury of a large party,"" said she:--""one can get nearevery body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talkto you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just likeyourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know howMiss Bates and her niece came here?""""How?--They were invited, were not they?""""Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of theircoming?""""They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?""""Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sadit would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, andcold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never sawher appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, andwould therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I couldnot bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guesshow readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I mademy way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would beat her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be makingher comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, youmay be sure. 'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,many thanks--'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley'scarriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quitesurprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such avery kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thingthat so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing hisusual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for theiraccommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would nothave had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excusefor assisting them.""""Very likely,"" said Emma--""nothing more likely. I know no man morelikely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thingreally good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not agallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering JaneFairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and foran act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix onmore than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrivedtogether; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word thatcould betray.""""Well,"" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, ""you give him credit for more simple,disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while MissBates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have neverbeen able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probableit appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and JaneFairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say toit?""""Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!"" exclaimed Emma. ""Dear Mrs. Weston, howcould you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley must notmarry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--Oh! no,no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley'smarrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that youshould think of such a thing.""""My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not wantthe match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the idea hasbeen given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished tomarry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, a boy of sixyears old, who knows nothing of the matter?""""Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--Mr.Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adoptit now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!""""Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very wellknow.""""But the imprudence of such a match!""""I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.""""I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation thanwhat you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, wouldbe quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for theBateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad toshew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no,no;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do somad a thing.""""Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.""""But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not theleast idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?--Heis as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, andhis library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond ofhis brother's children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill uphis time or his heart.""""My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really lovesJane Fairfax--""""Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I amsure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but--""""Well,"" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, ""perhaps the greatest good he coulddo them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.""""If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; avery shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have MissBates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thankinghim all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--'So verykind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's oldpetticoat. 'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for stillit would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say thattheir petticoats were all very strong.'""""For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbedby Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; andif he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, anddrown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a badconnexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I haveheard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! Theinterest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern thatshe should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himselfso warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on thepianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listento her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurredto me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--thoughwe have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from theCampbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspectinghim. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being inlove.""""Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do notthink it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley doesnothing mysteriously.""""I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftenerthan I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course ofthings, occur to him.""""Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have toldher so.""""There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strongnotion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent whenMrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.""""You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you havemany a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment--Ibelieve nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me thatMr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.""They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rathergaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the mostused of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed themthat tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the samemoment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them thehonour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of herconversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except thathe had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his verypressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best tolead, she gave a very proper compliance.She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more thanshe could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit inthe little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompanyher own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably bysurprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Herpardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usualfollowed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfectknowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothingof the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sangtogether once more; and Emma would then resign her place to MissFairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never couldattempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from thenumbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But thesight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away halfEmma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject ofMrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voicesgave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley'smarrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evilin it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a mostmortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very greatdeduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she couldnot at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must nevermarry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. Theytalked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainlyvery warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not havestruck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of hiskindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was inthe spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate onlyhis disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.""I often feel concern,"" said she, ""that I dare not make our carriagemore useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; butyou know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-tofor such a purpose.""""Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,"" hereplied;--""but you must often wish it, I am sure."" And he smiled withsuch seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed anotherstep.""This present from the Campbells,"" said she--""this pianoforte is verykindly given.""""Yes,"" he replied, and without the smallest apparentembarrassment.--""But they would have done better had they givenher notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is notenhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should haveexpected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.""From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley hadhad no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he wereentirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actualpreference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane'ssecond song, her voice grew thick.""That will do,"" said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--""you havesung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.""Another song, however, was soon begged for. ""One more;--they would notfatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.""And Frank Churchill was heard to say, ""I think you could manage thiswithout effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of thesong falls on the second.""Mr. Knightley grew angry.""That fellow,"" said he, indignantly, ""thinks of nothing but shewing offhis own voice. This must not be."" And touching Miss Bates, who at thatmoment passed near--""Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece singherself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy onher.""Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even tobe grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farthersinging. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouseand Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (withinfive minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knewwhere--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that everything was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistiblewaltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry toEmma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving onher voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If hewere to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augursomething. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs.Cole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; andshe led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more thanfive couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness ofit made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in apartner. They were a couple worth looking at.Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It wasgrowing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother'saccount. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again,they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.""Perhaps it is as well,"" said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma toher carriage. ""I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancingwould not have agreed with me, after yours."""
Emma,27,"CHAPTER IXEmma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visitafforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that shemight be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, mustbe amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delightedthe Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left aname behind her that would not soon die away.Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were twopoints on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had nottransgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions ofJane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but ithad been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submissionto all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which madeit difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held hertongue.The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; andthere she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret theinferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartilygrieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practisedvigorously an hour and a half.She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praisecould have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.""Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!""""Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's,than a lamp is like sunshine.""""Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quiteas well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every bodylast night said how well you played.""""Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. Thetruth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.""""Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, orthat if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Colesaid how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great dealabout your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.""""Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.""""Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had anytaste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.--There is nounderstanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, youknow, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have toteach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get intoany great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?""""Just as they always do--very vulgar.""""They told me something,"" said Harriet rather hesitatingly; ""but it isnothing of any consequence.""Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of itsproducing Mr. Elton.""They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.""""Oh!""""He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay todinner.""""Oh!""""They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not knowwhat she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay thereagain next summer.""""She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox shouldbe.""""She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her atdinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marryhim.""""Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgargirls in Highbury.""Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go withher. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and inher present state, would be dangerous.Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was alwaysvery long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslinsand changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much couldnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--Mr.Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at theoffice-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or astray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects shecould presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher withhis tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her fullbasket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdlingchildren round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, sheknew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enoughstill to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do withseeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two personsappeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking intoHighbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in thefirst place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearerRandalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught theireye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and theagreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure tothe present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to callon the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.""For my companion tells me,"" said she, ""that I absolutely promised MissBates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of itmyself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, Iam going now.""""And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,"" saidFrank Churchill, ""to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--ifyou are going home.""Mrs. Weston was disappointed.""I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.""""Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in theway here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt alwayssends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; andMiss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I todo?""""I am here on no business of my own,"" said Emma; ""I am only waiting formy friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.""""Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell shouldhave employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have anindifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would bepalatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the worldat a civil falsehood.""""I do not believe any such thing,"" replied Emma.--""I am persuaded thatyou can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; butthere is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quiteotherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night.""""Do come with me,"" said Mrs. Weston, ""if it be not very disagreeable toyou. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. Itwill be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.""He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in,and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with allthe force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plainmuslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, beit ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. Atlast it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.""Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?"" asked Mrs.Ford.--""Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is atHartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gownhome any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better goto Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,Mrs. Ford, could not you?""""It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of twoparcels.""""No more it is.""""No trouble in the world, ma'am,"" said the obliging Mrs. Ford.""Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if youplease, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know--No, Ithink, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, andtake it home with me at night. What do you advise?""""That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,if you please, Mrs. Ford.""""Aye, that will be much best,"" said Harriet, quite satisfied, ""I shouldnot at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.""Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.""My dear Miss Woodhouse,"" said the latter, ""I am just run across toentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. Howdo you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Westonto come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.""""I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--""""Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so gladto hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow mejust to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be sovery happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, she cannotrefuse.--'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse'sopinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shallbe more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--'Oh,' saidhe, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would youbelieve it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner inthe world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivetcame out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother hadno use of her spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, everybody ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane saidso. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty cameto say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of yourmistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallissent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, theWallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can beuncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thingbut the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the valueof our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eatsnothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightenedif you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so Isay one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about themiddle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes sowell as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I tookthe opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meethim in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so oftenheard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the onlyway that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. Wehave apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellentapple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and theseladies will oblige us.""Emma would be ""very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,"" and they did atlast move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,""How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Janecame back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only alittle too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.""""What was I talking of?"" said she, beginning again when they were all inthe street.Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.""I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother'sspectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he,'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kindexcessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I mustsay that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sortexcessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought outthe baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so veryobliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly, 'there is nothingin the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-lookinghome-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was sovery.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed theyare very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--onlywe do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made uspromise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be sogood as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finestsort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; andcertainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of histrees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard wasalways famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked theother day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eatingthese apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyedthem, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'Iam sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; forI have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let mekeep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,before they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for reallyas to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a greatmany left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all keptfor Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And whenhe was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not sayquarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quitedistressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wishedI had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening WilliamLarkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort ofapples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went downand spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to seehim. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said itwas all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought themall--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William didnot seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master hadsold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profitthan any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at theirbeing all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not beable to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bidher not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, forMrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sackswere sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty toldme, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightleyknow any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wantedto keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned itbefore I was aware.""Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitorswalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.""Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray takecare, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darkerand narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. MissWoodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. MissSmith, the step at the turning."""
Emma,28,"CHAPTER XThe appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, wastranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table nearher, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happycountenance on seeing Emma again.""This is a pleasure,"" said he, in rather a low voice, ""coming at leastten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to beuseful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.""""What!"" said Mrs. Weston, ""have not you finished it yet? you would notearn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.""""I have not been working uninterruptedly,"" he replied, ""I have beenassisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You seewe have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to bepersuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.""He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficientlyemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to makeher help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite readyto sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready,Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yetpossessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; shemust reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could notbut pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolvenever to expose them to her neighbour again.At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, thepowers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emmajoined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every properdiscrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.""Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,"" said Frank Churchill, with asmile at Emma, ""the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal ofColonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the uppernotes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ wouldparticularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave hisfriend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not youthink so?""Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston hadbeen speaking to her at the same moment.""It is not fair,"" said Emma, in a whisper; ""mine was a random guess. Donot distress her.""He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very littledoubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,""How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on thisoccasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonderwhich will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming tohand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be goingforward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequenceof an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent onlya general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend uponcontingencies and conveniences?""He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,""Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,"" said she, in a voice offorced calmness, ""I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must beall conjecture.""""Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes oneconjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make thisrivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hardat work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold theirtongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--MissFairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have thepleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healedfor the present.""He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape alittle from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged MissFairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.""If you are very kind,"" said he, ""it will be one of the waltzes wedanced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy themas I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad wedanced no longer; but I would have given worlds--all the worlds one everhas to give--for another half-hour.""She played.""What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made onehappy!--If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.""She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played somethingelse. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turningto Emma, said,""Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And hereare a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one mightexpect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful ofColonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no musichere. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it tohave been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothingincomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.""Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remainsof a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness,there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in theamusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.--Thisamiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing veryreprehensible feelings.He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--Emmatook the opportunity of whispering,""You speak too plain. She must understand you.""""I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the leastashamed of my meaning.""""But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.""""I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have nowa key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she doeswrong, she ought to feel it.""""She is not entirely without it, I think.""""I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at thismoment--_his_ favourite.""Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.Knightley on horse-back not far off.""Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just tothank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;but I can go into my mother's room you know. I dare say he will comein when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meetso!--Our little room so honoured!""She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening thecasement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and everysyllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, asif it had passed within the same apartment.""How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to youfor the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just readyfor us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.""So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard inhis turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,""How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all, butparticularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no coldlast night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.""And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hearher in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gaveEmma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head insteady scepticism.""So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,""resumed Miss Bates.He cut her short with,""I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?""""Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day shewanted something from Kingston.""""Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?""""No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?--MissWoodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.""""Well,"" said he, in a deliberating manner, ""for five minutes, perhaps.""""And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;so many friends!""""No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get onto Kingston as fast as I can.""""Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.""""No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear thepianoforte.""""Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party lastnight; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was notit delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw anything equal to it.""""Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose MissWoodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax shouldnot be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception,in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will saysomething pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay tohear it.""""Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--soshocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!""""What is the matter now?""""To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you hada great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. Youshould not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He nevercan bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and itwould have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to theroom,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He isgoing to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....""""Yes,"" said Jane, ""we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.""""Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door wasopen, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You musthave heard every thing to be sure. 'Can I do any thing for you atKingston?' said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must yoube going?--You seem but just come--so very obliging of you.""Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lastedlong; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceivedto be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, couldallow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfieldgates, before they set off for Randalls."
Emma,29,"CHAPTER XIIt may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have beenknown of young people passing many, many months successively, withoutbeing at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrueeither to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when thefelicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--itmust be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuadedto spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two youngpeople in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and histhe greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of thedifficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance.But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again howdelightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced--fordoing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with JaneFairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wickedaids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the room they were into see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking the dimensionsof the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all thatMr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a littlethe largest.His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole'sshould be finished there--that the same party should be collected,and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Westonmost willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly whothere would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of spaceto every couple.""You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two MissCoxes five,"" had been repeated many times over. ""And there will be thetwo Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, andMiss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for fivecouple there will be plenty of room.""But soon it came to be on one side,""But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not thinkthere will.""On another,""And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while tostand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.It will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as thethought of the moment.""Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother's, andmust be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbertwould have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word wasput in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one familyof cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintancewho could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couplewould be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in whatpossible manner they could be disposed of.The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. ""Might notthey use both rooms, and dance across the passage?"" It seemed thebest scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted abetter. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress aboutthe supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score ofhealth. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not bepersevered in.""Oh! no,"" said he; ""it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could notbear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you wouldbe quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray donot let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is verythoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quitethe thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening,and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of thedraught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is notquite the thing!""Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance ofit, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was nowclosed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing onlyin the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will onFrank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour beforehad been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavouredto be made out quite enough for ten.""We were too magnificent,"" said he. ""We allowed unnecessary room. Tencouple may stand here very well.""Emma demurred. ""It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could beworse than dancing without space to turn in?""""Very true,"" he gravely replied; ""it was very bad."" But still he went onmeasuring, and still he ended with,""I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.""""No, no,"" said she, ""you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadfulto be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to bedancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!""""There is no denying it,"" he replied. ""I agree with you exactly. A crowdin a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving picturesin a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however, havingproceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would bea disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know that--I amrather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.""Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a littleself-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure ofdancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while topause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of theiracquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he enteredthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance ofthe scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.""Well, Miss Woodhouse,"" he almost immediately began, ""your inclinationfor dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrorsof my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:--athought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be actedupon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dancesof this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at theCrown Inn?""""The Crown!""""Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less gratefulwelcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees noobjection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel.Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randallsrooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right youwere the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope youconsent?""""It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer formyself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that couldbe. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?""She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fullycomprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations werenecessary to make it acceptable.""No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--muchworse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, theyhad better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crownin his life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--avery bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.""""I was going to observe, sir,"" said Frank Churchill, ""that one of thegreat recommendations of this change would be the very little dangerof any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than atRandalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, butnobody else could.""""Sir,"" said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, ""you are very much mistakenif you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry isextremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand howthe room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.""""From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have nooccasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and itis that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air uponheated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.""""Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think ofopening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I neverheard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neitheryour father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would sufferit.""""Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind awindow-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I haveoften known it done myself.""""Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But Ilive out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk itover--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. Onecannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be soobliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see whatcan be done.""""But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--""""Oh!"" interrupted Emma, ""there will be plenty of time for talking everything over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be atthe Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will beso near their own stable.""""So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James evercomplains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I couldbe sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to betrusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.""""I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will beunder Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.""""There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, whois carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so manyyears ago, when I had the measles? 'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes towrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have Iheard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!""""Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poorlittle Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would havebeen very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He came four times a dayfor a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--whichwas our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hopewhenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send forPerry.""""My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,"" said FrankChurchill, ""examining the capabilities of the house. I left them thereand came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping youmight be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I wasdesired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure tothem, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothingsatisfactorily without you.""Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young peopleset off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy andvery happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he,finding every thing perfect.""Emma,"" said she, ""this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in placesyou see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow andforlorn than any thing I could have imagined.""""My dear, you are too particular,"" said her husband. ""What does all thatsignify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be asclean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on ourclub-nights.""The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, ""Men never knowwhen things are dirty or not;"" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each tohimself, ""Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.""One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built,suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, wasthe only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wantedas a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessaryby their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortablesupper? Another room of much better size might be secured for thepurpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkwardpassage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of beingmiserably crowded at supper.Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretchedsuggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, waspronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; andMrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line ofexpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,""I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.""And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps throughthe passage, was calling out,""You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is amere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.""""I wish,"" said Mrs. Weston, ""one could know which arrangement our guestsin general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasingmust be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.""""Yes, very true,"" cried Frank, ""very true. You want your neighbours'opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chiefof them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I callupon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.--And I do not knowwhether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations ofthe rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council.Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?""""Well--if you please,"" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, ""if you thinkshe will be of any use.""""You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,"" said Emma. ""Shewill be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. Shewill not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consultingMiss Bates.""""But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearingMiss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.""Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave ithis decided approbation.""Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter atonce. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a propererperson for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates.We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how to behappy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.""""Both sir! Can the old lady?""...""The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a greatblockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.""""Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both."" Andaway he ran.Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman anda good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of itmuch less than she had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and hereended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation atleast, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table andchair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were leftas mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.Stokes.--Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had alreadywritten to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was tobe.Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safercharacter,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once generaland minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for anotherhalf-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms,some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of thefuture. The party did not break up without Emma's being positivelysecured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor withouther overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, ""He has asked her, mydear. That's right. I knew he would!"""
Emma,30,"CHAPTER XIIOne thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completelysatisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the grantedterm of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston'sconfidence, she could not think it so very impossible that theChurchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond hisfortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must taketheir time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week wereentered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding andhoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in her opinion, the great risk, ofits being all in vain.Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. Hiswish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitudegenerally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of herball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provokingindifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, orbecause the plan had been formed without his being consulted, heseemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against itsexciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,than,""Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all thistrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to sayagainst it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh! yes,I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake asI can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins'sweek's account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeingdancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know whodoes.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something verydifferent.""This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was notin compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or soindignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball,for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It madeher animated--open hearted--she voluntarily said;--""Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with_very_ great pleasure.""It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferredthe society of William Larkins. No!--she was more and more convincedthat Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a greatdeal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side--but nolove.Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Twodays of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw ofevery thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew'sinstant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do withouthim; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband)when writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usualunwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking ofherself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gonewithin a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred butfor her own convenience.Mrs. Weston added, ""that he could only allow himself time to hurry toHighbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends therewhom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might beexpected at Hartfield very soon.""This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once it hadbeen read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. Theloss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young manmight be feeling!--It was too wretched!--Such a delightful evening asit would have been!--Every body so happy! and she and her partner thehappiest!--""I said it would be so,"" was the only consolation.Her father's feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally ofMrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and asfor the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but theywould all be safer at home.Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if thisreflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total wantof spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going awayalmost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. Hesat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousinghimself, it was only to say,""Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.""""But you will come again,"" said Emma. ""This will not be your only visitto Randalls.""""Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able toreturn!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object ofall my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town thisspring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--I am afraid itis a custom gone for ever.""""Our poor ball must be quite given up.""""Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize thepleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh! Miss Woodhouse,why are you always so right?""""Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would muchrather have been merry than wise.""""If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father dependson it. Do not forget your engagement.""Emma looked graciously.""Such a fortnight as it has been!"" he continued; ""every day moreprecious and more delightful than the day before!--every day makingme less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain atHighbury!""""As you do us such ample justice now,"" said Emma, laughing, ""I willventure to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sureyou did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long incoming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.""He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emmawas convinced that it had been so.""And you must be off this very morning?""""Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and Imust be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bringhim.""""Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and MissBates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might havestrengthened yours.""""Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. Itwas a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detainedby Miss Bates's being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible notto wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay myvisit, then""--He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.""In short,"" said he, ""perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly bequite without suspicion""--He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knewwhat to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutelyserious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, inthe hope of putting it by, she calmly said,""You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,then""--He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflectingon what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heardhim sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward momentspassed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,""It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given toHartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm""--He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was morein love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it mighthave ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhousesoon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable ofprocrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any thatwas doubtful, said, ""It was time to go;"" and the young man, though hemight and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.""I shall hear about you all,"" said he; ""that is my chief consolation.I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engagedMrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promiseit. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is reallyinterested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing. In her lettersI shall be at dear Highbury again.""A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest ""Good-bye,"" closed thespeech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had beenthe notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorryto part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from hisabsence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it toomuch.It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since hisarrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit tothe last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectationof seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of hisattentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happyfortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the commoncourse of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he had_almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy ofaffection he might be subject to, was another point; but at presentshe could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a consciouspreference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest,made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite ofevery previous determination against it.""I certainly must,"" said she. ""This sensation of listlessness,weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if Iwere not--for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good toothers. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for FrankChurchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the eveningwith his dear William Larkins now if he likes.""Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not saythat he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would havecontradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that hewas sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerablekindness added,""You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really outof luck; you are very much out of luck!""It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honestregret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composurewas odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering fromheadache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the balltaken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it wascharity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor ofill-health."
Emma,31,"CHAPTER XIIIEmma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideasonly varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a gooddeal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearingFrank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than everin seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him, andquite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how werehis spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming toRandalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could not admitherself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposedfor employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and,pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; andfarther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing orworking, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and closeof their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventingelegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on hisside was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection was always to subsideinto friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark theirparting; but still they were to part. When she became sensible of this,it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite ofher previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, neverto marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a strugglethan she could foresee in her own feelings.""I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,"" saidshe.--""In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, isthere any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is notreally necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly willnot persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. Ishould be sorry to be more.""Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.""_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--verymuch in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affectioncontinue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be mostinexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that Iimagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if hehad believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have beenso wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks andlanguage at parting would have been different.--Still, however, I mustbe on my guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuingwhat it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not lookupon him to be quite the sort of man--I do not altogether build uponhis steadiness or constancy.--His feelings are warm, but I can imaginethem rather changeable.--Every consideration of the subject, in short,makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--Ishall do very well again after a little while--and then, it will be agood thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives,and I shall have been let off easily.""When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; andshe read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made herat first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she hadundervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, givingthe particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all theaffection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable,and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposedattractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now ofapology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrastbetween the places in some of the first blessings of social life wasjust enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much moremight have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charmof her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more thanonce, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either acompliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and inthe very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by anysuch broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect ofher influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of allconveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were thesewords--""I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for MissWoodhouse's beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieusto her."" This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet wasremembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospectsas to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his ownimagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the materialpart, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returnedto Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she couldstill do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her.Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew moreinteresting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolationand happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words whichclothed it, the ""beautiful little friend,"" suggested to her theidea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was itimpossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior inunderstanding; but he had been very much struck with the lovelinessof her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all theprobabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--ForHarriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.""I must not dwell upon it,"" said she.--""I must not think of it. I knowthe danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things havehappened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, itwill be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterestedfriendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.""It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though itmight be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarterwas at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton'sengagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interesthad entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill'sdisappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistibleform.--His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; Mr.Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letterfrom Enscombe before ""Mr. Elton and his bride"" was in every body'smouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound.She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet'smind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal ofinsensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she hadnot attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actualapproach--new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all thereasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma couldgive. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet hada right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy workto be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreedto, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listenedsubmissively, and said ""it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhousedescribed--it was not worth while to think about them--and she would notthink about them any longer"" but no change of subject could avail, andthe next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons asbefore. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.""Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into.It was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assureyou.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it willbe a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger offorgetting it.""Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eagerexclamation. Emma continued,""I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talkless of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, Iwould wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than mycomfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is yourduty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions ofothers, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are veryimportant--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to actupon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.I want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimeshave felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather whatwould be kind by me.""This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea ofwanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she reallyloved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violenceof grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt towhat was right and support her in it very tolerably.""You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Wantgratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I dofor you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!""Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look andmanner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet sowell, nor valued her affection so highly before.""There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,"" said she afterwards toherself. ""There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tendernessof heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all theclearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. Itis tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generallybeloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--I have it not--butI know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all thecharm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!--I would not changeyou for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging femalebreathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth ahundred such--And for a wife--a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable. Imention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!"""
Emma,32,"CHAPTER XIVMrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might beinterrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, andit must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, tosettle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, ornot pretty at all.Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to makeher resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made apoint of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business mightbe gone through as soon as possible.She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room towhich she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, tolace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughtswould recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it wasnot to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; butshe behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visitwas of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupationof mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely toform an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond thenothing-meaning terms of being ""elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.""She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, therewas too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emmathought at least it would turn out so.As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would notpermit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was anawkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a manhad need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The womanwas better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and theprivilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense todepend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had justmarried, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he hadbeen expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look aslittle wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy ascould be.""Well, Miss Woodhouse,"" said Harriet, when they had quitted thehouse, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; ""Well, MissWoodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--Is not shevery charming?""There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.""Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.""""I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.""""Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.""""I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.""""Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; andshe came in his way.""""I dare say,"" returned Harriet, sighing again, ""I dare say she was verymuch attached to him.""""Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the womanwho loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought thisthe best offer she was likely to have.""""Yes,"" said Harriet earnestly, ""and well she might, nobody could everhave a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, MissWoodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just assuperior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a differentthing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit andadmire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrownhimself away, is such a comfort!--She does seem a charming young woman,just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her 'Augusta.' Howdelightful!""When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then seemore and judge better. From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield,and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarterof an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedlyattend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her thatMrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, andthinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be verysuperior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pertand familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people,and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and thather society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, itmight be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best ofher own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of thealliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, ""My brotherMr. Suckling's seat;""--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. Thegrounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house wasmodern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressedby the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see orimagine. ""Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by thelikeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-roomat Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.""--Mr. Elton was appealedto.--""Was not it astonishingly like?--She could really almost fancyherself at Maple Grove.""""And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like thestaircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I reallycould not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is verydelightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial toas Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a littlesigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body whosees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home.Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you willunderstand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all likewhat one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils ofmatrimony.""Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficientfor Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.""So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--thegrounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and standvery much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpseof a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly inmind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. Peoplewho have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thingin the same style.""Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea thatpeople who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for theextensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attackan error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,""When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think youhave overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.""""Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, youknow. Surry is the garden of England.""""Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Manycounties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well asSurry.""""No, I fancy not,"" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.""I never heard any county but Surry called so.""Emma was silenced.""My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summerat farthest,"" continued Mrs. Elton; ""and that will be our time forexploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I daresay. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds fourperfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_ carriage,we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. Theywould hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of theyear. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend theirbringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, MissWoodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr.Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King's-Westontwice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after theirfirst having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kindhere, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?""""No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the verystriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and weare a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at homethan engage in schemes of pleasure.""""Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody canbe more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at MapleGrove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol,'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely mustgo in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landauwithout a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will,would never stir beyond the park paling.' Many a time has she said so;and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary,when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a verybad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world ina proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. Iperfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--(lookingtowards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must be a greatdrawback. Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. Let me recommendBath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhousegood.""""My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving anybenefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.""""Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where thewaters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bathlife, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits,which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to itsrecommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwellon them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generallyunderstood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have livedso secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the bestsociety in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host ofacquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I havealways resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you anyattentions, and would be the very person for you to go into publicwith.""It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The ideaof her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friendof Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with thehelp of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of MissWoodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could havegiven, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; ""but their going to Bath wasquite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced thatthe place might suit her better than her father."" And then, to preventfarther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.""I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long knownthat you are a superior performer.""""Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superiorperformer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partiala quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond ofmusic--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoidof taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, playdelightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am gotinto. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life tome; and having always been used to a very musical society, both atMaple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. Ihonestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my futurehome, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should bedisagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I hadbeen accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the__world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear ofretirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world wasnot necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who hadno resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quiteindependent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, Ireally could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to anysacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to everyluxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were notnecessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. 'But,' said I,'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of amusical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, lifewould be a blank to me.'""""We cannot suppose,"" said Emma, smiling, ""that Mr. Elton would hesitateto assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; andI hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may bepardoned, in consideration of the motive.""""No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted tofind myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet littleconcerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish amusical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.Will not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shallnot be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would beparticularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me inpractice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story againstthem, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.""""But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,surely?""""I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches theinstrument--though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs.Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs.Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon myword it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry withSelina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman hasmany things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour thismorning shut up with my housekeeper.""""But every thing of that kind,"" said Emma, ""will soon be in so regular atrain--""""Well,"" said Mrs. Elton, laughing, ""we shall see.""Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothingmore to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose anothersubject.""We have been calling at Randalls,"" said she, ""and found them both athome; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favouritewith me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good--there issomething so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon onedirectly. She was your governess, I think?""Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardlywaited for the affirmative before she went on.""Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so verylady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.""""Mrs. Weston's manners,"" said Emma, ""were always particularly good.Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safestmodel for any young woman.""""And who do you think came in while we were there?""Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--andhow could she possibly guess?""Knightley!"" continued Mrs. Elton; ""Knightley himself!--Was not itlucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had neverseen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,I had a great curiosity. 'My friend Knightley' had been so oftenmentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do mycaro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend.Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, Ithink, a very gentleman-like man.""Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma couldbreathe.""Insufferable woman!"" was her immediate exclamation. ""Worse than I hadsupposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not havebelieved it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and callhim Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and herresources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whetherhe will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I couldnot have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite toform a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.Weston!--Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be agentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyondmy hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would FrankChurchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted hewould be! Ah! there I am--thinking of him directly. Always the firstperson to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comesas regularly into my mind!""--All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her fatherhad arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and wasready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.""Well, my dear,"" he deliberately began, ""considering we never saw herbefore, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say shewas very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A littlequickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believeI am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you andpoor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behavedyoung lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I thinkhe had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for nothaving been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; Isaid that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought tohave gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shewswhat a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into VicarageLane.""""I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.""""Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to herif possible. It was being very deficient.""""But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore whyshould you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought tobe no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if youmake so much of them.""""No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would alwayswish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially,is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, youknow, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be whothey may.""""Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know whatis. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction tosuch vanity-baits for poor young ladies.""""My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of merecommon politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with anyencouragement to people to marry.""Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long,did they occupy her."
Emma,33,"CHAPTER XVEmma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her illopinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such asMrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appearedwhenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment,but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superiorknowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.Elton's consequence only could surpass.There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently fromhis wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had the airof congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury,as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of hernew acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging,following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for grantedthat the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professedherself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praisepassed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by MissWoodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked witha good grace of her being ""very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.""In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared atfirst. Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by thelittle encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drewback in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; andthough the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it wasnecessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her manners, too--and Mr.Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering andnegligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but thesensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both verymuch.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had beenan offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story, undera colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him,had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the objectof their joint dislike.--When they had nothing else to say, it must bealways easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity whichthey dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent incontemptuous treatment of Harriet.Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Notmerely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed torecommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfiedwith expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but withoutsolicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist andbefriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about thethird time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantryon the subject.--""Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite raveabout Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild andladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has veryextraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremelywell. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! sheis absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word,I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--And her situation is so calculatedto affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavourto do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hersmust not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard thosecharming lines of the poet,        'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,          'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.""""I cannot think there is any danger of it,"" was Emma's calm answer--""andwhen you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation andunderstand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, Ihave no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.""""Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, suchobscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyedwith the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that shefeels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. Imust confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate fortimidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in thosewho are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assureyou, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me morethan I can express.""""You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any ofMiss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longerthan yourself, can shew her any other attention than""--""My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare toact. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many willfollow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a stylewhich could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, theleast inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were tosend us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort ofthing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have beenused to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite theother way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. MapleGrove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do notat all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, myresolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--I shall certainly haveher very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shallhave musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantlyon the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so veryextensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suither shortly.--I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to mybrother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like herextremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fearswill completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the mannersof either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very oftenindeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find aseat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.""""Poor Jane Fairfax!""--thought Emma.--""You have not deserved this. Youmay have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishmentbeyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs.Elton!--'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.' Heavens! Let me not supposethat she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour,there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!""Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusivelyaddressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a ""dear MissWoodhouse."" The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particularfriend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very activepatroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a generalway, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude forMrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guilelesssimplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies--themost amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished andcondescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprizewas that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs.Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with the Eltons,sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This wasastonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste orthe pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship asthe Vicarage had to offer.""She is a riddle, quite a riddle!"" said she.--""To chuse to remain heremonth after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse themortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her conversation,rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved herwith such real, generous affection.""Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbellswere gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells hadpromised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and freshinvitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to MissBates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friendscontrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she haddeclined it!""She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusingthis invitation,"" was Emma's conclusion. ""She must be under some sortof penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is greatfear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--She is _not_ to bewith the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must sheconsent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle.""Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, beforethe few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured thisapology for Jane.""We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is agood creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. Wemust consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste forwhat she goes to.""""You are right, Mrs. Weston,"" said Mr. Knightley warmly, ""Miss Fairfaxis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosenher. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions fromMrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.""Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and shewas herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presentlyreplied,""Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would ratherdisgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations I shouldhave imagined any thing but inviting.""""I should not wonder,"" said Mrs. Weston, ""if Miss Fairfax were to havebeen drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness inaccepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates mayvery likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greaterappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, inspite of the very natural wish of a little change.""Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a fewminutes silence, he said,""Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton doesnot talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know thedifference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spokenamongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond commoncivility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something moreearly implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that wemay have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may besure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mindand manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all therespect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probablynever fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity canprevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, ifnot in consciousness.""""I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,"" said Emma. Little Henrywas in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made herirresolute what else to say.""Yes,"" he replied, ""any body may know how highly I think of her.""""And yet,"" said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soonstopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she hurriedon--""And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly itis. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day orother.""Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thickleather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, orsome other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,""Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave mea hint of it six weeks ago.""He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did notherself know what to think. In a moment he went on--""That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I daresay, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very sure I shallnever ask her.""Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleasedenough to exclaim,""You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.""He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner whichshewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,""So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?""""No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now,meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without anyidea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallestwish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not comein and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.""Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, ""No,Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever takeme by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, I assureyou."" And soon afterwards, ""Jane Fairfax is a very charming youngwoman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She hasnot the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.""Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. ""Well,"" saidshe, ""and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?""""Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser orwittier than his neighbours.""""In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser andwittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--whatshe calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enoughin familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley--what can she do forMr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax acceptsher civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argumentweighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptationof getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph ofMiss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton'sacknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in herbeing under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitorwith praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not becontinually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring hera permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploringparties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.""""Jane Fairfax has feeling,"" said Mr. Knightley--""I do not accuse herof want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and hertemper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, thanshe used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to mysupposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfaxand conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with nothought beyond.""""Well, Mrs. Weston,"" said Emma triumphantly when he left them, ""what doyou say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?""""Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by theidea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if itwere to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me."""
Emma,34,"CHAPTER XVIEvery body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, wasdisposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties andevening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowedin so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they werenever to have a disengaged day.""I see how it is,"" said she. ""I see what a life I am to lead among you.Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quitethe fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing veryformidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not adisengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not havebeen at a loss.""No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-partiesperfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste fordinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, atthe poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highburycard-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were agood deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shewthem how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the springshe must return their civilities by one very superior party--in whichher card-tables should be set out with their separate candles andunbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for theevening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round therefreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner atHartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or sheshould be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitifulresentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it forten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made theusual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides theEltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all ofcourse--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet mustbe asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given withequal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleasedby Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it. ""She would rather notbe in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quiteable to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feelinguncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she wouldrather stay at home."" It was precisely what Emma would have wished, hadshe deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with thefortitude of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her togive up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite thevery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, shewas more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had oftenbeen.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her. He had said that JaneFairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.""This is very true,"" said she, ""at least as far as relates to me, whichwas all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--andalways knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--She willnever like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew hergreater attention than I have done.""Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and allhappy.--The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yetover. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest littleKnightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of someweeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, andstaying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very dayof this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his beingput off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happeningso. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as theutmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emmaapprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at notbeing able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours withoutfalling in with a dinner-party.She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, byrepresenting that though he certainly would make them nine, yethe always said so little, that the increase of noise would be veryimmaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, tohave him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to herinstead of his brother.The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. JohnKnightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town andmust be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in theevening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and thephilosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed thechief of even Emma's vexation.The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. JohnKnightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of beingagreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while theywaited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at insilence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--butMiss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talkto her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walkwith his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It wasnatural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,""I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I amsure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. I hope youturned directly.""""I went only to the post-office,"" said she, ""and reached home before therain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters whenI am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walkbefore breakfast does me good.""""Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.""""No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.""Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,""That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yardsfrom your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henryand John had seen more drops than they could count long before. Thepost-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you havelived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth goingthrough the rain for.""There was a little blush, and then this answer,""I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of everydearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growingolder should make me indifferent about letters.""""Indifferent! Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a verypositive curse.""""You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters offriendship.""""I have often thought them the worst of the two,"" replied he coolly.""Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.""""Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well--I amvery sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. Ican easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less thanto me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself whichmakes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have everybody dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again;and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office,I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather thanto-day.""""When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,""said John Knightley, ""I meant to imply the change of situation whichtime usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time willgenerally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the dailycircle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an oldfriend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years henceyou may have as many concentrated objects as I have.""It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant ""thankyou"" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tearin the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention wasnow claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on suchoccasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particularcompliments to the ladies, was ending with her--and with all his mildesturbanity, said,""I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morningin the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladiesare delicate plants. They should take care of their health and theircomplexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?""""Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kindsolicitude about me.""""My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--Ihope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my veryold friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. Youdo us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and Iare both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatestsatisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.""The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that hehad done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and herremonstrances now opened upon Jane.""My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in therain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you dosuch a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.""Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.""Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not knowhow to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert ourauthority.""""My advice,"" said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, ""I certainly dofeel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liableas you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularlycareful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always thinkrequires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or evenhalf a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your coughagain. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much tooreasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.""""Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,"" eagerly rejoined Mrs.Elton. ""We will not allow her to do such a thing again:""--and noddingsignificantly--""there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too andbring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from_us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to acceptsuch an accommodation.""""You are extremely kind,"" said Jane; ""but I cannot give up my earlywalk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walksomewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I havescarcely ever had a bad morning before.""""My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thingwithout the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flattermyself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If Imeet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point assettled.""""Excuse me,"" said Jane earnestly, ""I cannot by any means consent to suchan arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errandwere not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I amnot here, by my grandmama's.""""Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness toemploy our men.""Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead ofanswering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.""The post-office is a wonderful establishment!"" said she.--""Theregularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!""""It is certainly very well regulated.""""So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom thata letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about thekingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose,actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of badhands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.""""The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quicknessof sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any fartherexplanation,"" continued he, smiling, ""they are paid for it. That isthe key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be servedwell.""The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usualobservations made.""I have heard it asserted,"" said John Knightley, ""that the same sortof handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same masterteaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imaginethe likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have verylittle teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they canget. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have notalways known their writing apart.""""Yes,"" said his brother hesitatingly, ""there is a likeness. I know whatyou mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.""""Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,"" said Mr. Woodhouse; ""andalways did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston""--with half a sigh and half asmile at her.""I never saw any gentleman's handwriting""--Emma began, looking also atMrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attendingto some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect, ""Now, how amI going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at oncebefore all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundaboutphrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--thatwould be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronouncehis name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better andbetter.--Now for it.""Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--""Mr. Frank Churchillwrites one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.""""I do not admire it,"" said Mr. Knightley. ""It is too small--wantsstrength. It is like a woman's writing.""This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him againstthe base aspersion. ""No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not alarge hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston anyletter about her to produce?"" No, she had heard from him very lately,but having answered the letter, had put it away.""If we were in the other room,"" said Emma, ""if I had my writing-desk, Iam sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.--Do not youremember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?""""He chose to say he was employed""--""Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convinceMr. Knightley.""""Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,"" said Mr.Knightley dryly, ""writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, ofcourse, put forth his best.""Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, wasready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to beallowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--""Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.""Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whetherthe wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in fullexpectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not beenin vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--aglow both of complexion and spirits.She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and theexpense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--but sheabstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurtJane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of theroom, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to thebeauty and grace of each."
Emma,35,"CHAPTER XVIIWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found ithardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--with somuch perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engrossJane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged tobe almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Eltonleft them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, shesoon began again; and though much that passed between them was in ahalf-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoidinga knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office--catchingcold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion;and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasantto Jane--inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely tosuit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.""Here is April come!"" said she, ""I get quite anxious about you. Junewill soon be here.""""But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely lookedforward to the summer in general.""""But have you really heard of nothing?""""I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.""""Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of thedifficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.""""I not aware!"" said Jane, shaking her head; ""dear Mrs. Elton, who canhave thought of it as I have done?""""But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not knowhow many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I sawa vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin ofMr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; everybody was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle.Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of allhouses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to seeyou in.""""Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,""said Jane. ""I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will wantit;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I wouldnot wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.""""Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving metrouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly bemore interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge ina day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-outfor any thing eligible.""""Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject toher; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any bodytrouble.""""But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish beforeus. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve,and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence,is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begininquiring directly.""""Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make noinquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. WhenI am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of beinglong unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquirywould soon produce something--Offices for the sale--not quite of humanflesh--but of human intellect.""""Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling atthe slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend tothe abolition.""""I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,"" replied Jane;""governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widelydifferent certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as tothe greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. ButI only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that byapplying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting withsomething that would do.""""Something that would do!"" repeated Mrs. Elton. ""Aye, _that_ may suityour humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are;but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with anything that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a familynot moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies oflife.""""You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, Ithink, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.""""I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shallbe a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quiteon my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in thefirst circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to nameyour own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the familyas much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--if you knew the harp, youmight do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, Ireally believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for whatyou chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably andcomfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.""""You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of sucha situation together,"" said Jane, ""they are pretty sure to be equal;however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attemptedat present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I amobliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishingnothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer Ishall remain where I am, and as I am.""""And I am quite serious too, I assure you,"" replied Mrs. Elton gaily,""in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends towatch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.""In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr.Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object,and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,""Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of hisgallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creaturehe is;--I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wishyou had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you Ibegan to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy Iam rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you likeit?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I do not know whether itis not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of beingover-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornamentsnow, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear likea bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple styleof dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in theminority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--showand finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such atrimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it willlook well?""The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late dinner,and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too muchexpected by the best judges, for surprize--but there was great joy. Mr.Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been sorryto see him before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--Thata man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a dayof business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mileto another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company tillbed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noiseof numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who had beenin motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have beenstill, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who hadbeen in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, toquit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on theevening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Couldhe by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, therewould have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong ratherthan break up the party. John Knightley looked at him with amazement,then shrugged his shoulders, and said, ""I could not have believed iteven of _him_.""Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he wasexciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of beingprincipal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, wasmaking himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied theinquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of allher careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spreadabroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a familycommunication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, hehad not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body inthe room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; hehad met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.""Read it, read it,"" said he, ""it will give you pleasure; only a fewlines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.""The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talkingto them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible toevery body.""Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you sayto it?--I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?--Anne,my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?--Intown next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is asimpatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; mostlikely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, allnothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among usagain, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,and he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma readit all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it someother time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention thecircumstance to the others in a common way.""Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looksand words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she washappy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm andopen; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little occupiedin weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of heragitation, which she rather thought was considerable.Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicativeto want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partialcommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already.It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he mightnot have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularlydelighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, tobe made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, butshe was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would havebeen too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subjectwith her."
Emma,36,"CHAPTER XVIII""I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,""said Mr. Weston.Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended herby such a hope, smiled most graciously.""You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,"" hecontinued--""and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.""""Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have greatpleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.""""You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in aletter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing myson's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--itwas to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. Ihardly ever get a letter.""""And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.Weston--(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A mostdangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighboursfollow your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, wemarried women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh! Mr. Weston, I couldnot have believed it of you!""""Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in a hurry,merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all coming up totown directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has not been well thewhole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--so they are all tomove southward without loss of time.""""Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?""""Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, aconsiderable journey.""""Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther thanfrom Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to peopleof large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me--but twicein one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with fourhorses.""""The evil of the distance from Enscombe,"" said Mr. Weston, ""is, thatMrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave thesofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she complained, hesaid, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without havingboth his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree ofweakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means tosleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word. Certainly,delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. Youmust grant me that.""""No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of myown sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find me a formidableantagonist on that point. I always stand up for women--and I assure you,if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, youwould not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions toavoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her--and I believe I havecaught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?""""Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other finelady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the landfor""--Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,""Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assureyou. Do not run away with such an idea.""""Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorougha fine lady as any body ever beheld.""Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence ofit;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.Weston went on.""Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--butthis is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, andtherefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of healthnow; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I wouldnot say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs.Churchill's illness.""""If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, or toClifton?"" ""She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold forher. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has nowbeen a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and shebegins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but veryretired.""""Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired fromthe road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! Youseem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--AndMrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoythat sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough inherself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannothave too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so manymyself as to be quite independent of society.""""Frank was here in February for a fortnight.""""So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the societyof Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to callmyself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there beingsuch a creature in the world.""This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,""My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been fullof very little else than Mrs. Elton.""He had done his duty and could return to his son.""When Frank left us,"" continued he, ""it was quite uncertain when wemight see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It hasbeen completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasionhe would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turnup--but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfullydesponding. 'How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposedthat his uncle and aunt would spare him again?' and so forth--I alwaysfelt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see.I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if thingsare going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.""""Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say toa certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, becausethings did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapiditywhich suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim thathe was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen's saffron robewould be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel thosegloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The carriage--we haddisappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he came tome quite in despair.""She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantlyseized the opportunity of going on.""You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchillis ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place thanEnscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeableprospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely theseason of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost atthe longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, andnever too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the bestof it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather;there always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that weintended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and Ido not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, thesort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day orto-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness thanhaving him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is thestate of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will bepleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generallythought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston'spartiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, mostgratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.""""And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinionwill be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am oneof those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitlyguided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shalljudge of him.--I am no flatterer.""Mr. Weston was musing.""I hope,"" said he presently, ""I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; butthere are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me tospeak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant,Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I havemet with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laidto her. She was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have beenslighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his prideis nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sortof pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helplessand tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And whatinclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.She was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman;but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'dthem all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she isan upstart.""""Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quitea horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust topeople of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood whoare such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they givethemselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of themdirectly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, andencumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs,and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at WestHall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came fromBirmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston.One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is somethingdireful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of theTupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; andyet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even tomy brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearestneighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been elevenyears a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him--Ibelieve, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completedthe purchase before his death.""They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, havingsaid all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemedlittle disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, whichnobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spiritswhich would have made her prefer being silent.Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was toleave them early the next day; and he soon began with--""Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about theboys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at fulllength there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise thanher's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have torecommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physicthem.""""I rather hope to satisfy you both,"" said Emma, ""for I shall do allin my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; andhappiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.""""And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.""""That is very likely. You think so, do not you?""""I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--or evenmay be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue toincrease as much as they have done lately.""""Increase!""""Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made agreat difference in your way of life.""""Difference! No indeed I am not.""""There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company thanyou used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for onlyone day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--When did it happenbefore, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and youmix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella broughtan account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at theCrown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in yourgoings-on, is very great.""""Yes,"" said his brother quickly, ""it is Randalls that does it all.""""Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have lessinfluence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, thatHenry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only begyou to send them home.""""No,"" cried Mr. Knightley, ""that need not be the consequence. Let thembe sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.""""Upon my word,"" exclaimed Emma, ""you amuse me! I should like to know howmany of all my numerous engagements take place without your being ofthe party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure toattend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine--what havethey been? Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talked of,which never took place. I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. JohnKnightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends atonce here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning toMr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours fromHartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, Icannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if AuntEmma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much betterwith Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where sheis absent one--and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himselfor settling his accounts.""Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded withoutdifficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.VOLUME III"
Emma,37,"CHAPTER IA very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to thenature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. Shewas soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at allapprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment hadreally subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--butif he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of thetwo, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he hadtaken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of twomonths should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils beforeher:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She didnot mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would beincumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.That would be so very painful a conclusion of their presentacquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating somethingdecisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing acrisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquilstate.It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill'sfeelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had beenimagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He rode downfor a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came fromRandalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all her quickobservation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how shemust act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubtof his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an almost instant doubtof his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the same tendernessin the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing he wasless in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction probablyof her indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirableeffect.He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemeddelighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and hewas not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she readhis comparative difference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidentlyfluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he was, it seemeda liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her beliefon the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurryingaway to make other calls in Highbury. ""He had seen a group of oldacquaintance in the street as he passed--he had not stopped, he wouldnot stop for more than a word--but he had the vanity to think they wouldbe disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longerat Hartfield, he must hurry off."" She had no doubt as to his being lessin love--but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemedlike a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied adread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trustinghimself with her long.This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. Hisaunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account atRandall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it wasto be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of noservice to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she wasreally ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, atRandalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he lookedback, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half ayear ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that careand medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have manyyears of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by allhis father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merely imaginary,or that she was as strong as ever.It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She couldnot endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation andsuffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randallscommunicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately toRichmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill ofan eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. Aready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefitexpected from the change.Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two monthsbefore him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for thehouse was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote withthe greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as hecould even wish.Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He wasconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. Shehoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted.It was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would bereally having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles toa young man?--An hour's ride. He would be always coming over. Thedifference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to makethe whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteenmiles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--wasa serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would bespent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him inLondon; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the verydistance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by thisremoval,--the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before,but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, andvery soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines fromFrank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change, andthat he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours atany given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stoodbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged tospend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinelyhoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have anything the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone."
Emma,38,"CHAPTER IINo misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, FrankChurchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls beforedinner, and every thing was safe.No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The roomat the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than acommon meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in hisentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort ofthe rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him,and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company.She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, theRandalls party just sufficiently before them.Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did notsay much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it shouldbe; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of anothercarriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without greatsurprize. ""So unreasonably early!"" she was going to exclaim; but shepresently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming,like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; andthey were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishingearnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the companymight soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatoryinspection.Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Westondepended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a manwho had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very firstdistinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, buta little less of open-heartedness would have made him a highercharacter.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made aman what he ought to be.--She could fancy such a man. The whole partywalked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothingelse to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observein their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though_May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privycouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's doorto offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to bebrought by the Eltons.Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going tothe door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatientto begin, or afraid of being always near her.Mrs. Elton was spoken of. ""I think she must be here soon,"" said he. ""Ihave a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.""A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,said,""I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seeneither Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.""Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprietiespassed.""But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!"" said Mr. Weston, looking about. ""Wethought you were to bring them.""The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emmalonged to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; howhe was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles ofgraciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--""Iwill see that there are umbrellas, sir,"" said Frank to his father:""Miss Bates must not be forgotten:"" and away he went. Mr. Weston wasfollowing; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinionof his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.""A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told youI should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremelypleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think hima very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like andapprove--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--quite a horror of them.They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling norme had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say verycutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with themmuch better.""While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; butwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladiesjust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. ""I have no doubt of its being ourcarriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are soextremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--Whata pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--I understand youwere so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.""Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked intothe room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understoodby any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words,were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came intalking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after herbeing admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she washeard,""So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do notcare for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!--(as soonas she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This isadmirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Couldnot have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did youever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin'slamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her asI came in; she was standing in the entrance. 'Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' saidI--but I had not time for more."" She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--""Verywell, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hearit. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often,and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed.Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellenttime. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Mostcomfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you,Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note,or we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never weresuch neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am--.' Thankyou, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made hertake her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice. There were threeothers, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. ColonelCampbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you didnot wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--butMr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to stepupon--I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. FrankChurchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been infault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks ofyour good-nature. Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. FrankChurchill?--Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how doyou do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quitein fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know(eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word,Miss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You area judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does herhair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes Ideclare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for amoment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. Thisis delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he is.Don't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. Howdo you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode throughthe town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otwayand Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr.Arthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am muchobliged to you. Never better.--Don't I hear another carriage?--Who canthis be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charmingto be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I amquite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--Alittle tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.Every thing so good!""Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as MissBates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourseof Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behindher.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could notdetermine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look,compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidentlywanting to be complimented herself--and it was, ""How do you likemy gown?--How do you like my trimming?--How has Wright done myhair?""--with many other relative questions, all answered with patientpoliteness. Mrs. Elton then said, ""Nobody can think less of dress ingeneral than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body'seyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I haveno doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wishto be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room exceptmine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shallsee if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.I like him very well.""At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could notbut imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hearmore;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, tillanother suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctlyforward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,""Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--I wasthis moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient fortidings of us.""""Jane!""--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize anddispleasure.--""That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, Isuppose.""""How do you like Mrs. Elton?"" said Emma in a whisper.""Not at all.""""You are ungrateful.""""Ungrateful!--What do you mean?"" Then changing from a frown to asmile--""No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Whereis my father?--When are we to begin dancing?""Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walkedoff to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. andMrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must belaid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Eltonmust be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; whichinterfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emmaheard the sad truth with fortitude.""And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?"" said Mr. Weston.""She will think Frank ought to ask her.""Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; andboasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfectapprobation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help topersuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs.Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had alwaysconsidered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to makeher think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at thistime, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended tobegin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Westonmight be his son's superior.--In spite of this little rub, however,Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable lengthof the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hoursof unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr.Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, amongthe standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--notclassing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, whowere pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers weremade up,--so young as he looked!--He could not have appeared to greateradvantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall,firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders ofthe elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes;and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row ofyoung men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner,with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take thetrouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; butin general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroombetter, and could like Frank Churchill better.--He seemed oftenobserving her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of herdancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feelafraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That FrankChurchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessantattentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemedhappy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldombestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given inthe very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, veryrecordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usuallyare. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The twolast dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--theonly young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto thenumber of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was thewonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Eltonsauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possibleto be avoided: she was sure he would not--and she was expecting himevery moment to escape into the card-room.Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room wherethe sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in frontof them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintainingit. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, orspeaking to those who were close to her.--Emma saw it. She was not yetdancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had thereforeleisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she sawit all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactlybehind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr.Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue whichjust then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived thathis wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not onlylistening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.--Thekind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,""Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?"" to which his prompt reply was, ""Mostreadily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.""""Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am nodancer.""""If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,"" said he, ""I shall have greatpleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an oldmarried man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me verygreat pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.Gilbert.""""Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young ladydisengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith."" ""MissSmith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if Iwere not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at yourcommand--but my dancing days are over.""Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize andmortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! theamiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--She looked round for a moment; hehad joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himselffor settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between himand his wife.She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared herface might be as hot.In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leadingHarriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom moredelighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and thoughtoo distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she couldcatch his eye again.His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been forthe cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoymentand very high sense of the distinction which her happy featuresannounced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) veryfoolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, thoughgrowing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observingaudibly to her partner,""Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very good-natured,I declare.""Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard fromthat moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table andtaking up her spoon.""Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs.Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there willbe draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One doornailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--sogratified! Excellent dancing indeed!--Yes, my dear, I ran home, as Isaid I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, andnobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, avast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuitsand baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in someof her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you wereamused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestallJane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tellyou all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dearsir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I amnot helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, andme on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton isgoing; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now weall follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here weare at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no,there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd!I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw anything equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was tellingyou of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--Thebaked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but therewas a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in atfirst, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiledenough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama lovesbetter than sweetbread and asparagus--so she was rather disappointed,but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear ofits getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very muchconcerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not havesupposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothinglike it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,so that Jane is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--onlyit seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this housecannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishesfor grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, butit smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.""Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invitedhim irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in hisreprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.""They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,"" said he. ""Emma, why is itthat they are your enemies?""He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,""_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he maybe.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,that you did want him to marry Harriet.""""I did,"" replied Emma, ""and they cannot forgive me.""He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and heonly said,""I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.""""Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tellme I am wrong?""""Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong,I am sure the other tells you of it.""""I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There isa littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and Iwas fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through aseries of strange blunders!""""And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you thejustice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he haschosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, whichMrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artlessgirl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such awoman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.""Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle ofMr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.""Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you alldoing?--Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!Every body is asleep!""""I am ready,"" said Emma, ""whenever I am wanted.""""Whom are you going to dance with?"" asked Mr. Knightley.She hesitated a moment, and then replied, ""With you, if you will askme.""""Will you?"" said he, offering his hand.""Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we arenot really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.""""Brother and sister! no, indeed."""
Emma,39,"CHAPTER IIIThis little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerablepleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, whichshe walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremelyglad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting theEltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so muchalike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, waspeculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a fewminutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been theoccasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forwardto another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--FromHarriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted theballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were suddenlyopened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superiorcreature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma couldharbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injuriouscourtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons forsupplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be fartherrequisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, andMr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summermust be before her!She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that hecould not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he wasto be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them allto rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened upfor the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom shehad never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harrietleaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convinceher that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked whiteand frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--The iron gates and thefront-door were not twenty yards asunder;--they were all three soon inthe hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but thesuspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquaintedwith the whole.Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, andtaken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enoughfor safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury,making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it becamefor a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladieshad advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a smalldistance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, aparty of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; andMiss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and callingon Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge atthe top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much from crampafter dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on sucha return of it as made her absolutely powerless--and in this state, andexceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been morecourageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack couldnot be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children,headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinentin look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, sheimmediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them ashilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.--Shewas then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but herterror and her purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or rathersurrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling andconditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance hisleaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistanceat this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had inducedhim to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,a mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pairof scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten torestore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for afew minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and beingon foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. Theterror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was thentheir own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harrieteagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strengthenough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome.It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no otherplace.This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and ofHarriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--He darednot stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left himnot another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of hersafety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of peoplein the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the gratefulblessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young womanthrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certainideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, atleast. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematicianhave seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, andheard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had beenat work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How muchmore must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation andforesight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as hermind had already made.It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had everoccurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; norencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the veryperson, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancingto pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--Andknowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at thisperiod, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of hisattachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interestingconsequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should not bestrongly recommending each to the other.In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him, whileHarriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with asensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet'sown account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at theabominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing wasto take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough ofinterference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed.Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge ofwhat had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: butshe soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hourit was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage thosewho talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants inthe place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night'sball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat,and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without theirpromising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfortto him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for hisneighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as MissSmith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he hadthe pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all veryindifferent--which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She hadan unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man,for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not inventillnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they tookthemselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might havewalked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole historydwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and hernephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry andJohn were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and thegipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in theslightest particular from the original recital."
Emma,40,"CHAPTER IVA very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came onemorning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting downand hesitating, thus began:""Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I shouldlike to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, you know, itwill be over.""Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was aseriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much as herwords, for something more than ordinary.""It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,"" she continued, ""to haveno reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an alteredcreature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should havethe satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than isnecessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, andI dare say you understand me.""""Yes,"" said Emma, ""I hope I do.""""How I could so long a time be fancying myself!..."" cried Harriet,warmly. ""It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinaryin him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not--except that of thetwo I had rather not see him--and indeed I would go any distance roundto avoid him--but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admireher nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, andall that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shallnever forget her look the other night!--However, I assure you, MissWoodhouse, I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,it will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that Ihave been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought tohave destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--I know thatvery well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I will destroy itall--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that youmay see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcelholds?"" said she, with a conscious look.""Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?""""No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valuedvery much.""She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most__precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Withinabundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.""Now,"" said Harriet, ""you _must_ recollect.""""No, indeed I do not.""""Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget whatpassed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very lasttimes we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had mysore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--I think thevery evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your newpenknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--But, as you had noneabout you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I tookmine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and hecut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before hegave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help makinga treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it nowand then as a great treat.""""My dearest Harriet!"" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,and jumping up, ""you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving thisrelic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting thefinger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had noneabout me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in mypocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continualblush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--go on--whatelse?""""And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspectedit, you did it so naturally.""""And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!""said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling dividedbetween wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, ""Lordbless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton apiece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! Inever was equal to this.""""Here,"" resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, ""here is somethingstill more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, becausethis is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaisternever did.""Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of anold pencil,--the part without any lead.""This was really his,"" said Harriet.--""Do not you remember onemorning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I forget exactlythe day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that__evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it wasabout spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something aboutbrewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took outhis pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, andit would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon thetable as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as Idared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.""""I do remember it,"" cried Emma; ""I perfectly remember it.--Talkingabout spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying weliked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. Iperfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, wasnot he? I have an idea he was standing just here.""""Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannotrecollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where Iam now.""--""Well, go on.""""Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except thatI am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to seeme do it.""""My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness intreasuring up these things?""""Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish Icould forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, youknow, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was--buthad not resolution enough to part with them.""""But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have nota word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might beuseful.""""I shall be happier to burn it,"" replied Harriet. ""It has a disagreeablelook to me. I must get rid of every thing.--There it goes, and there isan end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.""""And when,"" thought Emma, ""will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?""She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was alreadymade, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had _told_ nofortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnightafter the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quiteundesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made theinformation she received more valuable. She merely said, in the courseof some trivial chat, ""Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would adviseyou to do so and so""--and thought no more of it, till after a minute'ssilence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, ""I shall nevermarry.""Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after amoment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,""Never marry!--This is a new resolution.""""It is one that I shall never change, however.""After another short hesitation, ""I hope it does not proceed from--I hopeit is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?""""Mr. Elton indeed!"" cried Harriet indignantly.--""Oh! no""--and Emma couldjust catch the words, ""so superior to Mr. Elton!""She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed nofarther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--PerhapsHarriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she weretotally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear toomuch; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, suchan open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectlyresolved.--She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know atonce, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was alwaysbest. She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on anyapplication of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have thejudicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided,and thus spoke--""Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Yourresolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results froman idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly yoursuperior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?""""Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at adistance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest ofthe world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are soproper, in me especially.""""I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered youwas enough to warm your heart.""""Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--The veryrecollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--when I saw himcoming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such a change! Inone moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!""""It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes,honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But thatit will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do notadvise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engagefor its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will bewisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do notlet them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Beobservant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. Igive you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again onthe subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward Iknow nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were verywrong before; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt,and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; butyet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have beenmatches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would nothave you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured yourraising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I shallalways know how to value.""Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma wasvery decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend.Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--and it must besaving her from the danger of degradation."
Emma,41,"CHAPTER VIn this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened uponHartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. TheEltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the useto be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at hergrandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was againdelayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likelyto remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were ableto defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her service, and save herself frombeing hurried into a delightful situation against her will.Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainlytaken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislikehim more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuitof Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. Every thingdeclared it; his own attentions, his father's hints, his mother-in-law'sguarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, andindiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting himto Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightleybegan to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. Hecould not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence betweenthem--he thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on his side, which,having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirelyvoid of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errorsof imagination. _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.He was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and hehad seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, fromthe admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he wasagain in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen;nor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper andhis fire at twilight,""Myself creating what I saw,""brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of privateliking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spendhis evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joinedthem; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, likethemselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as theweather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Batesand her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, onreaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort ofvisiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go inand drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; andafter a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listenedto, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's mostobliging invitation.As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.The gentlemen spoke of his horse.""By the bye,"" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, ""whatbecame of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?""Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, ""I did not know that he ever hadany such plan.""""Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.""""Me! impossible!""""Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as whatwas certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and wasextremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as shethought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. Youmust remember it now?""""Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.""""Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must havedreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as ifyou were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.""""What is this?--What is this?"" cried Mr. Weston, ""about Perry and acarriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he canafford it. You had it from himself, had you?""""No, sir,"" replied his son, laughing, ""I seem to have had it fromnobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's havingmentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with allthese particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllable ofit before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer.I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gonethrough my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.Perry.""""It is odd though,"" observed his father, ""that you should have had sucha regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely youshould be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage! andhis wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--justwhat will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a littlepremature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dreamcertainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?""Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests toprepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr.Weston's hint.""Why, to own the truth,"" cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vainto be heard the last two minutes, ""if I must speak on this subject,there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not meanto say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddestdreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledgethat there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herselfmentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well asourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and onlythought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he shouldhave a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morningbecause she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remembergrandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where wehad been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was toRandalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeedI do not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to gobeyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul thatI know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my havingnever dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing beforeI am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now andthen I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not likeJane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the leastthing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly rememberMrs. Perry's coming.--Extraordinary dream, indeed!""They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded MissBates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, wherehe thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he hadinvoluntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busywith her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waitedat the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in FrankChurchill the determination of catching her eye--he seemed watching herintently--in vain, however, if it were so--Jane passed between theminto the hall, and looked at neither.There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must beborne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round thelarge modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, andwhich none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade herfather to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of hisdaily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly,and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.""Miss Woodhouse,"" said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behindhim, which he could reach as he sat, ""have your nephews taken away theiralphabets--their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated ratheras winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters onemorning. I want to puzzle you again.""Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the tablewas quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so muchdisposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming wordsfor each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietnessof the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who hadoften been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston hadoccasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting,with tender melancholy, over the departure of the ""poor little boys,""or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, howbeautifully Emma had written it.Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slightglance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next toEmma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see themall; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as littleapparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smilepushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, andburied from sight, she should have looked on the table instead oflooking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager afterevery fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell towork. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. Theword was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was ablush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be,was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of hisfavourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be somedecided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meethim at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry andtrick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on FrankChurchill's part.With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarmand distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a shortword prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. Hesaw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining,though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure;for she said, ""Nonsense! for shame!"" He heard Frank Churchill next say,with a glance towards Jane, ""I will give it to her--shall I?""--and asclearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. ""No, no, youmust not; you shall not, indeed.""It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love withoutfeeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handedover the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedatecivility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosityto know what this word might be, made him seize every possible momentfor darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw itto be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his;her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning,the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She wasevidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushedmore deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, ""I did notknow that proper names were allowed,"" pushed away the letters with evenan angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other wordthat could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made theattack, and turned towards her aunt.""Aye, very true, my dear,"" cried the latter, though Jane had not spokena word--""I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to begoing indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be lookingfor us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you goodnight.""Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt hadpreconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; butso many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightleythought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towardsher, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwardslooking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growingdusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightleycould not tell.He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full ofwhat he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist hisobservations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--an anxiousfriend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see herin a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It washis duty.""Pray, Emma,"" said he, ""may I ask in what lay the great amusement, thepoignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw theword, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to theone, and so very distressing to the other.""Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the trueexplanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she wasreally ashamed of having ever imparted them.""Oh!"" she cried in evident embarrassment, ""it all meant nothing; a merejoke among ourselves.""""The joke,"" he replied gravely, ""seemed confined to you and Mr.Churchill.""He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would ratherbusy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while indoubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference--fruitlessinterference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed todeclare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her,to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference,rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than theremembrance of neglect in such a cause.""My dear Emma,"" said he at last, with earnest kindness, ""do youthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between thegentleman and lady we have been speaking of?""""Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.--Whydo you make a doubt of it?""""Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, orthat she admired him?""""Never, never!"" she cried with a most open eagerness--""Never, for thetwentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how couldit possibly come into your head?""""I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment betweenthem--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to bepublic.""""Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you canvouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--very sorryto check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do. There is noadmiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances whichhave caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances--feelingsrather of a totally different nature--it is impossible exactly toexplain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it--but the part which iscapable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as farfrom any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings inthe world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and Ican _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman'sindifference.""She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfactionwhich silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would haveprolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of hissuspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of acircumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meethers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too muchirritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolutefever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almostevery evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hastyleave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey."
Emma,42,"CHAPTER VIAfter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortificationof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No suchimportation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores atpresent. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restrictedto the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming hadbeen united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose healthseemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs.Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as muchincreased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours wasby the approach of it.Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great dealof pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must allwait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thoughtat first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thingneed not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill thoughthe Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in theautumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there wasto be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given theidea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see whatevery body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreedto chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of thechosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in aquiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle andpreparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of theEltons and the Sucklings.This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not butfeel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Westonthat he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister hadfailed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and thatas Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if shehad no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing but her very greatdislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectlyaware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be donewithout a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; andshe found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement whichshe would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which wouldprobably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs.Elton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of heroutward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in herreflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.""I am glad you approve of what I have done,"" said he very comfortably.""But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing withoutnumbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures itsown amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could notleave her out.""Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Eltonwas growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as topigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thinginto sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be venturedon, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources wereinadequate to such an attack.""Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?"" she cried.--""And such weatherfor exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. Whatare we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothingdone. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightfulexploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.""""You had better explore to Donwell,"" replied Mr. Knightley. ""That maybe done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripeningfast.""If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the ""Oh! I should likeit of all things,"" was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell wasfamous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to temptthe lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him againand again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and was extremelygratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing complimentas she chose to consider it.""You may depend upon me,"" said she. ""I certainly will come. Name yourday, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?""""I cannot name a day,"" said he, ""till I have spoken to some others whomI would wish to meet you.""""Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am LadyPatroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.""""I hope you will bring Elton,"" said he: ""but I will not trouble you togive any other invitations.""""Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraidof delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leaveit all to me. I will invite your guests.""""No,""--he calmly replied,--""there is but one married woman in the worldwhom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, andthat one is--""""--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,"" interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.""No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage suchmatters myself.""""Ah! you are an odd creature!"" she cried, satisfied to have no onepreferred to herself.--""You are a humourist, and may say what youlike. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and heraunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meetingthe Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them.""""You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on MissBates in my way home.""""That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. Itis to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. Ishall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hangingon my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can bemore simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to beno form or parade--a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk aboutyour gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit undertrees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all outof doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as naturaland simple as possible. Is not that your idea?""""Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to havethe table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity ofgentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think isbest observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eatingstrawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.""""Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the bye,can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray besincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspectanything--""""I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.""""Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremelyclever.""""I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, andwould spurn any body's assistance.""""I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come ondonkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. Ireally must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country lifeI conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have everso many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up athome;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and inwinter there is dirt.""""You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane isnever dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, ifyou prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing tobe as much to your taste as possible.""""That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have thewarmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--Yes,believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me inthe whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to pleaseme.""Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. Hewished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors toeat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under thespecious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent atDonwell, be tempted away to his misery.He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him forhis easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for twoyears. ""Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could govery well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girlswalked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now,in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house againexceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, andany other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all tohis, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. Hethought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kindand sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of diningout.""Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. Theinvitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, likeMrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular complimentto themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations ofpleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over tojoin them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which couldhave been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say thathe should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time inwriting, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party toBox Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell wassettled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearingexactly right.Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse wassafely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake ofthis al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in theAbbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he washappily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of whathad been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and notto heat themselves.--Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there onpurpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, whenall the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener andsympathiser.It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she wassatisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and lookaround her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particularobservation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which mustever be so interesting to her and all her family.She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance withthe present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewedthe respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,characteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardensstretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, withall the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundanceof timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagancehad rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlikeit, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with manycomfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it oughtto be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respectfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untaintedin blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had;but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given themneither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These werepleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till itwas necessary to do as the others did, and collect round thestrawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting FrankChurchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket,was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, ortalking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought orspoken of.--""The best fruit in England--every body's favourite--alwayswholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful togather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morningdecidedly the best time--never tired--every sort good--hautboyinfinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly eatable--hautboysvery scarce--Chili preferred--white wood finest flavour of all--priceof strawberries in London--abundance about Bristol--MapleGrove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactlydifferent--no general rule--gardeners never to be put out of theirway--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much of--inferiorto cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to gatheringstrawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it nolonger--must go and sit in the shade.""Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once byMrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, toinquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--She had somefears of his horse.Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obligedto overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--Asituation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton hadreceived notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was notwith Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity andsplendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,every thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed withimmediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and shepositively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfaxcontinued to assure her that she would not at present engage in anything, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urgebefore.--Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write anacquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, wasastonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--andat last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed aremoval.--""Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them thegardens--all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.""--Thepertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed oneanother to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, whichstretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemedthe finish of the pleasure grounds.--It led to nothing; nothing but aview at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemedintended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach tothe house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might bethe taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, andthe view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, atnearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeperform beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank ofconsiderable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and atthe bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose theAbbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close andhandsome curve around it.It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without beingoppressive.In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; andtowards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harrietdistinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley andHarriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.--Therehad been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, andturned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasantconversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorryto see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but nowshe feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages ofprosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard inblossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at thewall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. Hewas giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emmareceived a smile which seemed to say, ""These are my own concerns. I havea right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected ofintroducing Robert Martin.""--She did not suspect him. It was too olda story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--Theytook a few turns together along the walk.--The shade was mostrefreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--and theywere all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.Weston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himselfuneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishingthat he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as tocoming, with more than common certainty. ""His aunt was so much better,that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.""--Mrs. Churchill'sstate, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to suchsudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonabledependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he wasprevented coming.--Emma looked at Harriet while the point was underconsideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to seewhat had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as faras the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, atany rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.--Mr.Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest partof the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him,stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him, thatMrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise andvariety which her spirits seemed to need.Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse'sentertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had beenprepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindnesshad perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused.Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew themall to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, thanin a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, andmethodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emmawalked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation ofthe entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, whenJane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with alook of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, therewas a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was inquest of.""Will you be so kind,"" said she, ""when I am missed, as to say that I amgone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late itis, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall be wanted,and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to anybody. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to theponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not bemissed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I amgone?""""Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highburyalone?""""Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twentyminutes.""""But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let myfather's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can beround in five minutes.""""Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--Andfor _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have toguard others!""She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, ""Thatcan be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order thecarriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already.""""I am,""--she answered--""I am fatigued; but it is not the sort offatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all knowat times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, areexhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me havemy own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.""Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering intoher feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, andwatched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look wasgrateful--and her parting words, ""Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort ofbeing sometimes alone!""--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, andto describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,even towards some of those who loved her best.""Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!"" said Emma, as she turned back intothe hall again. ""I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray oftheir just horrors, the more I shall like you.""Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had onlyaccomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when FrankChurchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she hadforgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Westonwould be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were rightwho had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained bya temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which hadlasted some hours--and he had quite given up every thought of coming,till very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he should have, andhow late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not havecome at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thinglike it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothing killed himlike heat--he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat wasintolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from theslight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.""You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,"" said Emma.""As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill bespared--but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all begoing soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as Icame--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!""Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill'sstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out ofhumour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might behis constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were oftenthe cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his takingsome refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in thedining-room--and she humanely pointed out the door.""No--he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make himhotter."" In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; andmuttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all herattention to her father, saying in secret--""I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a manwho is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easy temperwill not mind it.""He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and cameback all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, likehimself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in theiremployment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were lookingover views in Swisserland.""As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,"" said he. ""I shallnever be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have mysketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or mypoem. I shall do something to expose myself.""""That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go toSwisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.""""They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed forher. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. Iassure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that Ishall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. Iwant a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetratingeyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, ifI could.""""You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a fewhardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?""""_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I donot look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwartedin every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunateperson.""""You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go andeat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice ofcold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly ona par with the rest of us.""""No--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.""""We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. It is notSwisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want ofa change. You will stay, and go with us?""""No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.""""But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.""""No--It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.""""Then pray stay at Richmond.""""But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of youall there without me.""""These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse yourown degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.""The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; otherstook it very composedly; but there was a very general distress anddisturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained. That it wastime for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short finalarrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill'slittle inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his lastwords to Emma were,""Well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.""She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmondwas to take him back before the following evening."
Emma,43,"CHAPTER VIIThey had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outwardcircumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were infavour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiatingsafely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in goodtime. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, withthe Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every bodyhad a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amountof the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits,a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too muchinto parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge ofMiss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemedat first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. andMrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeableas they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on thehill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties,too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or anycheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen FrankChurchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing--lookedwithout seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowingwhat she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harrietshould be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he caredfor--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gayand easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admissionto be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animatingperiod of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation,meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it musthave had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could verywell describe. ""Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted togetherexcessively."" They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--andto having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, toIreland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from anyreal felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she hadexpected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she likedhim for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winningback her heart. She still intended him for her friend.""How much I am obliged to you,"" said he, ""for telling me to cometo-day!--If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost allthe happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.""""Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that youwere too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than youdeserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.""""Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.""""It is hotter to-day.""""Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.""""You are comfortable because you are under command.""""Your command?--Yes.""""Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your ownmanagement; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot be alwayswith you, it is best to believe your temper under your own commandrather than mine.""""It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without amotive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be alwayswith me. You are always with me.""""Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could notbegin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.""""Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen youfirst in February.""""Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)--nobodyspeaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talkingnonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.""""I say nothing of which I am ashamed,"" replied he, with livelyimpudence. ""I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hillhear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side,and Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February."" And thenwhispering--""Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we doto rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladiesand gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinkingof?""Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a greatdeal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr.Knightley's answer was the most distinct.""Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are allthinking of?""""Oh! no, no""--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--""Upon noaccount in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the bruntof just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinkingof. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancingat Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid ofknowing.""""It is a sort of thing,"" cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, ""which _I_should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--_I_ never was in anycircle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--""Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,""Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed--quite unheardof--but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Everybody knows what is due to _you_.""""It will not do,"" whispered Frank to Emma; ""they are most of themaffronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen--Iam ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right ofknowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requiressomething very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Hereare seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am veryentertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either onething very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated--or twothings moderately clever--or three things very dull indeed, and sheengages to laugh heartily at them all.""""Oh! very well,"" exclaimed Miss Bates, ""then I need not be uneasy.'Three things very dull indeed.' That will just do for me, you know. Ishall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on everybody's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?""Emma could not resist.""Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but you will belimited as to number--only three at once.""Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did notimmediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could notanger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.""Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself verydisagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.""""I like your plan,"" cried Mr. Weston. ""Agreed, agreed. I will do mybest. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?""""Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,"" answered his son;--""but we shall beindulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.""""No, no,"" said Emma, ""it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let mehear it.""""I doubt its being very clever myself,"" said Mr. Weston. ""It is too mucha matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet arethere, that express perfection?""""What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know.""""Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will neverguess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?""Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a veryindifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at andenjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touchthe rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.Knightley gravely said,""This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Westonhas done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every bodyelse. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.""""Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,"" said Mrs. Elton; ""_I_really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I hadan acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at allpleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!--You knowwho I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are verywell at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out ofplace, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer.Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have wittythings at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have agreat deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed tojudge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please,Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothingclever to say--not one of us.""Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,"" added her husband, with a sort of sneeringconsciousness; ""_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain MissWoodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man--quite good fornothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?""""With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.Come, Jane, take my other arm.""Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.""Happy couple!"" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out ofhearing:--""How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as theydid, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only kneweach other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!--for as toany real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any publicplace, can give--it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It isonly by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just asthey always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, itis all guess and luck--and will generally be ill-luck. How many a manhas committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the restof his life!""Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her ownconfederates, spoke now.""Such things do occur, undoubtedly.""--She was stopped by a cough. FrankChurchill turned towards her to listen.""You were speaking,"" said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.""I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstancesdo sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to bevery frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--but there isgenerally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood tomean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happinessmust be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunateacquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.""He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soonafterwards said, in a lively tone,""Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever Imarry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning toEmma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any bodyfixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile athis father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her, educateher.""""And make her like myself.""""By all means, if you can.""""Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.""""She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, I shall cometo you for my wife. Remember.""Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch everyfavourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could say?Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.""Now, ma'am,"" said Jane to her aunt, ""shall we join Mrs. Elton?""""If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I wasready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shallsoon overtake her. There she is--no, that's somebody else. That's oneof the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--Well, Ideclare--""They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston,his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spiritsnow rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last offlattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly aboutwith any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattendedto, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. Theappearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of thecarriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting andpreparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drivehome which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day ofpleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,she hoped never to be betrayed into again.While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. Helooked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,""Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: aprivilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you beso unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit toa woman of her character, age, and situation?--Emma, I had not thoughtit possible.""Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.""Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.""""I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked ofit since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--with whatcandour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring yourforbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was forever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must beso irksome.""""Oh!"" cried Emma, ""I know there is not a better creature in the world:but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are mostunfortunately blended in her.""""They are blended,"" said he, ""I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous overthe good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmlessabsurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for anyliberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation--but, Emma,consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunkfrom the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, mustprobably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It wasbadly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she hadseen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have younow, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her,humble her--and before her niece, too--and before others, many of whom(certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatmentof her.--This is not pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far frompleasant to me; but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, andtrusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than youcan do now.""While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it wasready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He hadmisinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and hertongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and, onentering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome--then reproachingherself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting inapparent sullenness, she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew adifference; but it was just too late. He had turned away, and the horseswere in motion. She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, withwhat appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, andevery thing left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have beenexpressed--almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt soagitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She wasmost forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was nodenying. She felt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal,so cruel to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed herself to such illopinion in any one she valued! And how suffer him to leave her withoutsaying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feelit more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessaryto speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears runningdown her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble tocheck them, extraordinary as they were."
Emma,44,"CHAPTER VIIIThe wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all theevening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she couldnot tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it wasa morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rationalsatisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, thanany she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father,was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there shewas giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; andfeeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection andconfiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to anysevere reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart.She hoped no one could have said to her, ""How could you be so unfeelingto your father?--I must, I will tell you truths while I can."" MissBates should never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could doaway the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss,her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact;scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of truecontrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it shouldbe the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, thatnothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that shemight see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come inwhile she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not beashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.""The ladies were all at home."" She had never rejoiced at the soundbefore, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or ofderiving it, except in subsequent ridicule.There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; themaid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait amoment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed bothescaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse of,looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heardMiss Bates saying, ""Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid down uponthe bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.""Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did notquite understand what was going on.""I am afraid Jane is not very well,"" said she, ""but I do not know; they_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I amvery little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like? Iam sure she will be here presently.""Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment's fear of Miss Bateskeeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came--""Very happy andobliged""--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the samecheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner. A veryfriendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to areturn of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.""Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--andare come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, inme--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for usto part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadfulheadache just now, writing all the morning:--such long letters, youknow, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. 'My dear,' saidI, 'you will blind yourself'--for tears were in her eyes perpetually.One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and thoughshe is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as noyoung woman before ever met with on first going out--do not think usungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(againdispersing her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what aheadache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feelany blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. Tolook at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to havesecured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you--she isnot able--she is gone into her own room--I want her to lie down upon thebed. 'My dear,' said I, 'I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:'but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now thatshe has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She willbe extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but yourkindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door--I was quiteashamed--but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened thatwe had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did notknow any body was coming. 'It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, 'depend uponit. Nobody else would come so early.' 'Well,' said she, 'it must beborne some time or other, and it may as well be now.' But then Pattycame in, and said it was you. 'Oh!' said I, 'it is Miss Woodhouse: I amsure you will like to see her.'--'I can see nobody,' said she; andup she got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep youwaiting--and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. 'If you must go, mydear,' said I, 'you must, and I will say you are laid down upon thebed.'""Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growingkinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings actedas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing butpity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations ofthe past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve onseeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bearto see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret andsolicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collectedfrom Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much forMiss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. ""It must be a severetrial to them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till ColonelCampbell's return.""""So very kind!"" replied Miss Bates. ""But you are always kind.""There was no bearing such an ""always;"" and to break through her dreadfulgratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--""Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?""""To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have the chargeof her three little girls--delightful children. Impossible that anysituation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs. Smallridge isintimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only fourmiles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.""""Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--""""Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. Shewould not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, 'No;' for when Janefirst heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morningwe were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decidedagainst accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactlyas you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till ColonelCampbell's return, and nothing should induce her to enter into anyengagement at present--and so she told Mrs. Elton over and overagain--and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change hermind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, sawfarther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out insuch a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but shepositively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, asJane wished her; she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening itwas all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had notthe least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, thatupon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, shehad come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of ittill it was all settled.""""You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?""""Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, uponthe hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. 'You _must__all_ spend your evening with us,' said she--'I positively must have you_all_ come.'""""Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?""""No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though Ithought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let himoff, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, anda very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, MissWoodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemedrather fagged after the morning's party. Even pleasure, you know, isfatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to haveenjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.""""Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had beenmaking up her mind the whole day?""""I dare say she had.""""Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all herfriends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that ispossible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.""""Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thingin the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings andBragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberaland elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a mostdelightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--and asto the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, thereare not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated withsuch regard and kindness!--It will be nothing but pleasure, a life ofpleasure.--And her salary!--I really cannot venture to name her salaryto you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, wouldhardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane.""""Ah! madam,"" cried Emma, ""if other children are at all like what Iremember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount ofwhat I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearlyearned.""""You are so noble in your ideas!""""And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?""""Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it. Within afortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does notknow how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, andsay, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more.""""Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel andMrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before theirreturn?""""Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situationas she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonishedwhen she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and whenMrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It wasbefore tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea, because we werejust going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I rememberthinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happenedbefore tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room beforetea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, Ihave a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-sevenyears; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with therheumatic gout in his joints--I must go and see him to-day; and so willJane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came totalk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to dohimself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thingof that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had beentelling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent toRandalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happenedbefore tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.""Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new thiscircumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that shecould be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill'sgoing, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being theaccumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of theservants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmondsoon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger,however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill hadsent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerableaccount of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay comingback beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill havingresolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horseseeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for theCrown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boygoing a good pace, and driving very steady.There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and itcaught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which alreadyengaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance inthe world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, theother nothing--and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny,and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by MissBates's saying,""Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to becomeof that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--'Youmust go,' said she. 'You and I must part. You will have no businesshere.--Let it stay, however,' said she; 'give it houseroom till ColonelCampbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle forme; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--And to this day, I dobelieve, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter's.""Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance ofall her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough;and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say ofthe good wishes which she really felt, took leave."
Emma,45,"CHAPTER IXEmma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sittingwith her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a mannerdecidedly graver than usual, said,""I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spenda few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,besides the 'love,' which nobody carries?""""Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?""""Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.""Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friendsagain. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her fatherbegan his inquiries.""Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you find myworthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been verymuch obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always soattentive to them!""Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with asmile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.Knightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression inher favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all thathad passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified--and inanother moment still more so, by a little movement of more than commonfriendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--whether she had notherself made the first motion, she could not say--she might, perhaps,have rather offered it--but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainlywas on the point of carrying it to his lips--when, from some fancy orother, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple, whyhe should change his mind when it was all but done, she could notperceive.--He would have judged better, she thought, if he had notstopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it wasthat his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else ithappened, but she thought nothing became him more.--It was with him,of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--She could not but recall theattempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.--He leftthem immediately afterwards--gone in a moment. He always moved with thealertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, butnow he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished shehad left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasureto talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neitherwould she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for sheknew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have happenedat a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, would have beenpleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she could notbe deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinishedgallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recoveredhis good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour, shefound. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeablenessof Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going onhorseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated hernews of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified;it supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him. Hehad long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, andcould talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London hadbeen an unexpected blow.""I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortablysettled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare sayher acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a drysituation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought tobe a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylorwas to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not beinduced to go away after it has been her home so long.""The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing elseinto the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce thedeath of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reasonto hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirtyhours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from anything foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a shortstruggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree ofgravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for thesurviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know whereshe would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoopsto folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to bedisagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, wasnow spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fullyjustified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. Theevent acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness ofimaginary complaints.""Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try thetemper. It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults, whatwould Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would bedreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.""--Even Mr.Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, ""Ah! poor woman,who would have thought it!"" and resolved, that his mourning should be ashandsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over herbroad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How itwould affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was alsoa very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill,the grief of her husband--her mind glanced over them both with awe andcompassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank mightbe affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a momentall the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would havenothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was fearedby nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by hisnephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should formthe attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feelno certainty of its being already formed.Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emmawas gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutualforbearance.Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating allthat was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchillwas better than could be expected; and their first removal, on thedeparture of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a veryold friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising avisit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done forHarriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possibleon Emma's side.It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whoseprospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagementsnow allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew herkindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcelya stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom shehad been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom shewould have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wantedto be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testifyrespect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend a dayat Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused,and by a verbal message. ""Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;""and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appearedthat she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though againsther own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severeheadaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt thepossibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed.Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--appetite quitegone--and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothingtouching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehensionof the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she hadundertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself,though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Herpresent home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervousdisorder:--confined always to one room;--he could have wished itotherwise--and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he mustacknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of thatdescription. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,in fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derivedmore evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover someway of being useful. To take her--be it only an hour or two--fromher aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rationalconversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and thefollowing morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling languageshe could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at anyhour that Jane would name--mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decidedopinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was onlyin this short note:""Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to anyexercise.""Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it wasimpossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewedindisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might bestcounteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of theanswer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's,in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--but it would notdo;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeingwith her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatestservice--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all invain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane wasquite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make herworse.--Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appearthat she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.""Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see anybody--any body at all--Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--andMrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but,except them, Jane would really see nobody.""Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither couldshe feel any right of preference herself--she submitted, therefore, andonly questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece's appetite and diet,which she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bateswas very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat anything:--Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thingthey could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) wasdistasteful.Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to anexamination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior qualitywas speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In halfan hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from MissBates, but ""dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sentback; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover, she insisted onher saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.""When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wanderingabout the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon ofthe very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to anyexercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--that Jane wasresolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiablefrom this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, andinequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so littlecredit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: butshe had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and ofbeing able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privyto all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seeninto her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing toreprove."
Emma,46,"CHAPTER XOne morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma wascalled downstairs to Mr. Weston, who ""could not stay five minutes,and wanted particularly to speak with her.""--He met her at theparlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key ofhis voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,""Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it bepossible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.""""Is she unwell?""""No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered thecarriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that youknow--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?""""Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse whatyou ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is she really notill?""""Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all intime. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!""To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Somethingreally important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend waswell, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father,that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out ofthe house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.""Now,""--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--""nowMr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.""""No, no,""--he gravely replied.--""Don't ask me. I promised my wife toleave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do notbe impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.""""Break it to me,"" cried Emma, standing still with terror.--""GoodGod!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in BrunswickSquare. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what itis.""""No, indeed you are mistaken.""--""Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearestfriends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?--I charge youby all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.""""Upon my word, Emma.""--""Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, thatit has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!--What can be to be_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?""""Upon my honour,"" said he very seriously, ""it does not. It is not inthe smallest degree connected with any human being of the name ofKnightley.""Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.""I was wrong,"" he continued, ""in talking of its being _broke_ to you.I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concernyou--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, mydear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don'tsay that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be muchworse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.""Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. Sheasked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, andthat soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some moneyconcern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in thecircumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmondhad brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen naturalchildren, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though veryundesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little morethan an animating curiosity.""Who is that gentleman on horseback?"" said she, as theyproceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,than with any other view.""I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, Iassure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by thistime.""""Has your son been with you, then?""""Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.""For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guardedand demure,""Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.""They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--""Well, my dear,"" saidhe, as they entered the room--""I have brought her, and now I hope youwill soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use indelay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.""--And Emma distinctlyheard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--""I havebeen as good as my word. She has not the least idea.""Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, sheeagerly said,""What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, Ifind, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. I have beenwalking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense.Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of yourdistress, whatever it may be.""""Have you indeed no idea?"" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.""Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are tohear?""""So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.""""You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;""(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) ""He hasbeen here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It isimpossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on asubject,--to announce an attachment--""She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then ofHarriet.""More than an attachment, indeed,"" resumed Mrs. Weston; ""anengagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what willany body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax areengaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!""Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,""Jane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?""""You may well be amazed,"" returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--""You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemnengagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth, andkept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it butthemselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--It is sowonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almostincredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him.""Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between twoideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; andpoor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and requireconfirmation, repeated confirmation.""Well,"" said she at last, trying to recover herself; ""this is acircumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can atall comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter--before eitherof them came to Highbury?""""Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, verymuch. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct wecannot excuse.""Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, ""I will not pretend _not_ tounderstand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assuredthat no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you areapprehensive of.""Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was assteady as her words.""That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of mypresent perfect indifference,"" she continued, ""I will farther tell you,that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when Idid like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You maybelieve me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.""Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could findutterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more goodthan any thing else in the world could do.""Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,"" said she. ""Onthis point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that youmight be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.""""I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of gratefulwonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had heto come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with mannersso _very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, ashe certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with perseveringattention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged toanother?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--How couldhe tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--very wrong,very wrong indeed.""""From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--""""And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,which I can neither comprehend nor respect.""""There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only aquarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allowthe full use even of the time he could stay--but that there had beenmisunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might verypossibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.""""Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, muchbeyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk himin my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!--None of that uprightintegrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain oftrick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction ofhis life.""""Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrongin this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his havingmany, very many, good qualities; and--""""Good God!"" cried Emma, not attending to her.--""Mrs. Smallridge, too!Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean bysuch horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself--to suffer hereven to think of such a measure!""""He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquithim. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--or atleast not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--Till yesterday, Iknow he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I donot know how, but by some letter or message--and it was the discovery ofwhat she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined himto come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself onhis kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state ofconcealment that had been carrying on so long.""Emma began to listen better.""I am to hear from him soon,"" continued Mrs. Weston. ""He told me atparting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner whichseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Letus wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. Itmay make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not tobe understood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry tocondemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I amsatisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxiousfor its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They mustboth have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy andconcealment.""""_His_ sufferings,"" replied Emma dryly, ""do not appear to have done himmuch harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?""""Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely adifficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been ahope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest inthe family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly oppositeto what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undueinfluence does not survive the grave!--He gave his consent with verylittle persuasion.""""Ah!"" thought Emma, ""he would have done as much for Harriet.""""This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light thismorning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--andthen came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He was very muchagitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appear quitea different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--Inaddition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her sovery unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there wasevery appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.""""And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with suchperfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know ofthe engagement?""Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.""None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being inthe world but their two selves.""""Well,"" said Emma, ""I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to theidea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it avery abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system ofhypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--To come among us withprofessions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secretto judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truthand honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have beencarrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments andwords that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take theconsequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way notperfectly agreeable!""""I am quite easy on that head,"" replied Mrs. Weston. ""I am very surethat I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might nothave heard.""""You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when youimagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.""""True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of MissFairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; andas to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.""At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited himin; and, while he was coming round, added, ""Now, dearest Emma, let meintreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease,and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best ofit--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. Itis not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that,why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, forFrank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of suchsteadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given hercredit for--and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite ofthis one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much maybe said in her situation for even that error!""""Much, indeed!"" cried Emma feelingly. ""If a woman can ever beexcused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like JaneFairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that 'the world is not their's,nor the world's law.'""She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,exclaiming,""A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was adevice, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent ofguessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost halfyour property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter ofcondolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulateyou, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of themost lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.""A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was asright as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits wasimmediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shookher heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject ina manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to thinkthe engagement no very bad thing. His companions suggested only whatcould palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time theyhad talked it all over together, and he had talked it all over againwith Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectlyreconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frankcould possibly have done."
Emma,47,"CHAPTER XI""Harriet, poor Harriet!""--Those were the words; in them lay thetormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constitutedthe real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved veryill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _his_behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was thescrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave thedeepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time thedupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spokenprophetically, when he once said, ""Emma, you have been no friendto Harriet Smith.""--She was afraid she had done her nothing butdisservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself, in thisinstance as in the former, with being the sole and original author ofthe mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwisenever have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledgedher admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had evergiven her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guiltyof having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might haveprevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influencewould have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she oughtto have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend'shappiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directedher to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him,and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caringfor her.--""But, with common sense,"" she added, ""I am afraid I have hadlittle to do.""She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angrywith Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for JaneFairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any presentsolicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she needno longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-healthhaving, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Herdays of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, andhappy, and prosperous.--Emma could now imagine why her own attentionshad been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. Nodoubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival;and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard berepulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. Sheunderstood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself fromthe injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged thatJane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond herdesert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was littlesympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearfulthat this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; andjudging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producingreserve and self-command, it would.--She must communicate the painfultruth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy hadbeen among Mr. Weston's parting words. ""For the present, the wholeaffair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point ofit, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.""--Emma hadpromised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almostridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicateoffice to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through byherself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat quickon hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs.Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the event ofthe disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--But of that, unfortunately,there could be no chance.""Well, Miss Woodhouse!"" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--""isnot this the oddest news that ever was?""""What news do you mean?"" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look orvoice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.""About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!--youneed not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told mehimself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you,but he said you knew it.""""What did Mr. Weston tell you?""--said Emma, still perplexed.""Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchillare to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to oneanother this long while. How very odd!""It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,that Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appearedabsolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, ordisappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked ather, quite unable to speak.""Had you any idea,"" cried Harriet, ""of his being in love with her?--You,perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into everybody's heart; but nobody else--""""Upon my word,"" said Emma, ""I begin to doubt my having any such talent.Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attachedto another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if notopenly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I neverhad the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. FrankChurchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be verysure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.""""Me!"" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. ""Why should you cautionme?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.""""I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,"" repliedEmma, smiling; ""but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--andnot very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that youdid care about him?""""Him!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?""turning away distressed.""Harriet!"" cried Emma, after a moment's pause--""What do you mean?--GoodHeaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--""She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she sat down,waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned fromher, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it wasin a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.""I should not have thought it possible,"" she began, ""that you could havemisunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him--but consideringhow infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not havethought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him inthe company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think ofMr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you shouldhave been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing thatyou entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, Ishould have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not told me that morewonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greaterdisparity (those were your very words);--I should not have dared togive way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, whohad been always acquainted with him--""""Harriet!"" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--""Let us understandeach other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are youspeaking of--Mr. Knightley?""""To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else--and soI thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear aspossible.""""Not quite,"" returned Emma, with forced calmness, ""for all that you thensaid, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almostassert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the serviceMr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from thegipsies, was spoken of.""""Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!""""My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said onthe occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment;that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremelynatural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as toyour sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations hadbeen in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it isstrong on my memory.""""Oh, dear,"" cried Harriet, ""now I recollect what you mean; but Iwas thinking of something very different at the time. It was not thegipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with someelevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr.Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would notstand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. Thatwas the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; thatwas the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to everyother being upon earth.""""Good God!"" cried Emma, ""this has been a most unfortunate--mostdeplorable mistake!--What is to be done?""""You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? Atleast, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if theother had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--""She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.""I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,"" she resumed, ""that you should feel agreat difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You mustthink one five hundred million times more above me than the other. ButI hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it mayappear--. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderfulthings had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place thanbetween Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if sucha thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be sofortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if_he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you willnot set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. Butyou are too good for that, I am sure.""Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look ather in consternation, and hastily said,""Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?""""Yes,"" replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--""I must say that Ihave.""Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficientfor making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers,once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched--sheadmitted--she acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worsethat Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with FrankChurchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's havingsome hope of a return? It darted through her, with the speed of anarrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the samefew minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessedher before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! Howinconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had beenher conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck herwith dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in theworld. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of allthese demerits--some concern for her own appearance, and a strong senseof justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to thegirl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice requiredthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma theresolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparentkindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmostextent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had donenothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarilyformed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whosecounsels had never led her right.--Rousing from reflection, therefore,and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a moreinviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject whichhad first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that wasquite sunk and lost.--Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley andthemselves.Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very gladto be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, andsuch a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to givethe history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma'stremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed thanHarriet's, but they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; but hermind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, sucha burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexingemotions, must create.--She listened with much inward suffering, butwith great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or wellarranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but itcontained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology ofthe narration, a substance to sink her spirit--especially with thecorroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour ofMr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever sincethose two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,found her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or atleast from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him,Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than hehad been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different mannertowards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had beenmore and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together,he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so verydelightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew itto have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, toalmost the same extent.--Harriet repeated expressions of approbationand praise from him--and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreementwith what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her forbeing without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,feelings.--She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; hehad dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet'smemory, many little particulars of the notice she had received fromhim, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a complimentimplied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passedundiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences tobe mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not withoutsome degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his walkingwith her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where theyhad been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (asshe was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself--and at first,he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever donebefore, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recallit without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her, whether heraffections were engaged.--But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appearedlikely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking aboutfarming:--The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly halfan hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning ofhis being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said thathe could not stay five minutes--and his having told her, during theirconversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much againsthis inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (asEmma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The superior degree ofconfidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave hersevere pain.On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after alittle reflection, venture the following question. ""Might he not?--Isnot it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state ofyour affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he might haveMr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion withspirit.""Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope Iknow better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.""When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear MissWoodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.""I never should have presumed to think of it at first,"" said she, ""butfor you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviourbe the rule of mine--and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I maydeserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing sovery wonderful.""The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings,made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her to sayon reply,""Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the lastman in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of hisfeeling for her more than he really does.""Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence sosatisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, whichat that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of herfather's footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was toomuch agitated to encounter him. ""She could not compose herself--Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;""--with most readyencouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through anotherdoor--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst ofEmma's feelings: ""Oh God! that I had never seen her!""The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for herthoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that hadrushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought afresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation toher.--How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she hadbeen thus practising on herself, and living under!--The blunders, theblindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about,she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, everyposture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she hadbeen imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she hadbeen imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that shewas wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning ofwretchedness.To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the firstendeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father'sclaims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feelingdeclared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?--When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which FrankChurchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in herestimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--and asthey must at any time have been compared by her, had it--oh! had it, byany blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.--Shesaw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had notbeen infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under adelusion, totally ignorant of her own heart--and, in short, that she hadnever really cared for Frank Churchill at all!This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This wasthe knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, whichshe reached; and without being long in reaching it.--She was mostsorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealedto her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--Every other part of her mindwas disgusting.With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of everybody's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange everybody's destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken; andshe had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief. She hadbrought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, onher must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for hisattachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness ofHarriet's;--and even were this not the case, he would never have knownHarriet at all but for her folly.Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance everywonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfaxbecame commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting nosurprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said orthought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on herside! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how itmust sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers,the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification anddisdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Couldit be?--No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, fromimpossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilitiesto be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one, perhapstoo busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Wasit new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent,incongruous--or for chance and circumstance (as second causes) to directthe human fate?Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where sheought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not, with afolly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying theunexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectablein the line of life to which she ought to belong--all would have beensafe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts toMr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of sucha man till actually assured of it!--But Harriet was less humble, hadfewer scruples than formerly.--Her inferiority, whether of mind orsituation, seemed little felt.--She had seemed more sensible of Mr.Elton's being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.Knightley's.--Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been atpains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who butherself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--IfHarriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too."
Emma,48,"CHAPTER XIITill now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never knownhow much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feelingit her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in thedread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it hadbeen.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having nofemale connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claimscould be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how farhe loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him formany years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligentor perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he wouldnot acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, hehad loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour toimprove her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creaturehad at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dearto him; might she not say, very dear?--When the suggestions of hope,however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could notpresume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthyof being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley._She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea ofblindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very recentproof of its impartiality.--How shocked had he been by her behaviour toMiss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to heron the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far toostrongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice andclear-sighted goodwill.--She had no hope, nothing to deserve the nameof hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which wasnow in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, attimes much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and beoverrating his regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be theconsequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, shebelieved she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue thesame Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley toall the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their preciousintercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would befully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It would beincompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she feltfor him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would notmarry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and shehoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at leastbe able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see themhenceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she hadhitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know howto admit that she could be blinded here.--He was expected back everyday. The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon itappeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, sheresolved against seeing Harriet.--It would do neither of them good,it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.--She wasresolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet hadno authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only toirritate.--She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to begthat she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it tobe her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowedto pass before they met again, except in the company of others--sheobjected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if theyhad forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, andapproved, and was grateful.This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma'sthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who hadbeen calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in herway home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, torelate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through hisshare of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having theninduced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned withmuch more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarterof an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance ofawkward feelings, could have afforded.A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while herfriend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good dealof agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at allat present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, andto defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr.Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as,considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paidwithout leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; hewas extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and herfamily, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for ""such things,""he observed, ""always got about."" Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Westonhad very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and verygreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She hadhardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewnhow deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-feltsatisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of herdaughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been agratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so trulyrespectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little ofthemselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. MissFairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston toinvite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of herembarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception,and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feelingtowards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; butwhen these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of thepresent and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston wasconvinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to hercompanion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been,and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.""On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of somany months,"" continued Mrs. Weston, ""she was energetic. This was oneof her expressions. 'I will not say, that since I entered into theengagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I havenever known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip,Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.""""Poor girl!"" said Emma. ""She thinks herself wrong, then, for havingconsented to a private engagement?""""Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposedto blame herself. 'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state ofperpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishmentthat misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is noexpiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to allmy sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken,and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells meought not to be.' 'Do not imagine, madam,' she continued, 'that I wastaught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or thecare of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own;and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstancesmay appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to ColonelCampbell.'""""Poor girl!"" said Emma again. ""She loves him then excessively, Isuppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could beled to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered herjudgment.""""Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.""""I am afraid,"" returned Emma, sighing, ""that I must often havecontributed to make her unhappy.""""On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But sheprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to themisunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One naturalconsequence of the evil she had involved herself in,"" she said, ""wasthat of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having doneamiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captiousand irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard forhim to bear. 'I did not make the allowances,' said she, 'which I oughtto have done, for his temper and spirits--his delightful spirits, andthat gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any othercircumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching tome, as they were at first.' She then began to speak of you, and of thegreat kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blushwhich shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I hadan opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for everywish and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you hadnever received any proper acknowledgment from herself.""""If I did not know her to be happy now,"" said Emma, seriously, ""which,in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, shemust be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if therewere an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done MissFairfax!--Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), thisis all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interestingparticulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she isvery good--I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortuneshould be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.""Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thoughtwell of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved himvery much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with agreat deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but she had too muchto urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square orto Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston endedwith, ""We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know,but I hope it will soon come,"" she was obliged to pause before sheanswered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could atall recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.""Are you well, my Emma?"" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.""Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give meintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.""Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food forunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and hersense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regrettednot having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for theenvious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attentionto Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know herbetter; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavouredto find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in allprobability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on hernow.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one asan associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other--whatwas she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on thisimportant matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing her asshe ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from theabominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which shehad not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had sounpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made asubject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by thelevity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of evilsurrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuadedthat she must herself have been the worst. She must have been aperpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, withouther having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and onBox Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear nomore.The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, andnothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind wasdespoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sightsthe longer visible.The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerablycomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side, and byexertions which had never cost her half so much before. It remindedher of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston'swedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea,and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs ofHartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortlybe over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of theapproaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,no pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she fearedwould experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--thatmight not be even partially brightened. If all took place thatmight take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must becomparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with thespirits only of ruined happiness.The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer thanherself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husbandalso.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and MissFairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong toHighbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe.All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, theloss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful orof rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longercoming there for his evening comfort!--No longer walking in at allhours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How wasit to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake;if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's societyall that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first,the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the bestblessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness butthe reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all herown work?When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain froma start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for afew seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolationor composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own betterconduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety mightbe the following and every future winter of her life to the past, itwould yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, andleave her less to regret when it were gone."
Emma,49,"CHAPTER XIIIThe weather continued much the same all the following morning; andthe same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign atHartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into asofter quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it wassummer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emmaresolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisitesight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant aftera storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for the serenity theymight gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon afterdinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no timein hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened, andthoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr.Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.--Itwas the first intimation of his being returned from London. She hadbeen thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen milesdistant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. Shemust be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The""How d'ye do's"" were quiet and constrained on each side. She asked aftertheir mutual friends; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Onlythat morning. He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk withher, she found. ""He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he wasnot wanted there, preferred being out of doors.""--She thought he neitherlooked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it,suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating hisplans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in which they hadbeen received.They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often lookingat her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her togive. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted tospeak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching forencouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead theway to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she couldnot bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. Sheconsidered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--""You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rathersurprize you.""""Have I?"" said he quietly, and looking at her; ""of what nature?""""Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.""After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, hereplied,""If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard thatalready.""""How is it possible?"" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towardshim; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have calledat Mrs. Goddard's in his way.""I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, andat the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.""Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little morecomposure,""_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you havehad your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to giveme a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking voiceand a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.""For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of havingexcited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn withinhis, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a toneof great sensibility, speaking low,""Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellentsense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you will not allowyourself--."" Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a morebroken and subdued accent, ""The feelings of the warmestfriendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!""--And in a louder,steadier tone, he concluded with, ""He will soon be gone. They will soonbe in Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.""Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutterof pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,""You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what wasgoing on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamedof, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which maywell lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reasonto regret that I was not in the secret earlier.""""Emma!"" cried he, looking eagerly at her, ""are you, indeed?""--butchecking himself--""No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleasedthat you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed! andit will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgmentof more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were notfarther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from your manners, assuremyself as to the degree of what you felt--I could only be certain thatthere was a preference--and a preference which I never believed him todeserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewardedwith that sweet young woman?--Jane, Jane, you will be a miserablecreature.""""Mr. Knightley,"" said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--""Iam in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in yourerror; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, Ihave as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have beenat all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be naturalfor a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--But I neverhave.""He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he wouldnot. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to hisclemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself inhis opinion. She went on, however.""I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by hisattentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--An old story,probably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of mysex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets upas I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was continually here--I always foundhim very pleasant--and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out thecauses ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last--my vanitywas flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however--for sometime, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thoughtthem a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never beenattached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. Henever wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his realsituation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him; andno one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself--exceptthat I was _not_ blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, Iwas somehow or other safe from him.""She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that herconduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as shecould judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone,he said,""I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him hasbeen but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, hemay yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have nomotive for wishing him ill--and for her sake, whose happiness will beinvolved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish himwell.""""I have no doubt of their being happy together,"" said Emma; ""I believethem to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.""""He is a most fortunate man!"" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. ""Soearly in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses awife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn sucha prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterestedlove, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness;every thing in his favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far asregards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;equality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of herheart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for itwill be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would alwayswish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from;and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must,I think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, thefavourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.--He meetswith a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot evenweary her by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family soughtround the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have foundher superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only tospeak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--He had usedevery body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--He is afortunate man indeed!""""You speak as if you envied him.""""And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.""Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentenceof Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, ifpossible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totallydifferent--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited forbreath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,""You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, Isee, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma,I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid thenext moment.""""Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,"" she eagerly cried. ""Take alittle time, consider, do not commit yourself.""""Thank you,"" said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and notanother syllable followed.Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide inher--perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might givejust praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence,relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be moreintolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They hadreached the house.""You are going in, I suppose?"" said he.""No,""--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in whichhe still spoke--""I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is notgone."" And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--""I stopped youungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave youpain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, orto ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--asa friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like. Iwill tell you exactly what I think.""""As a friend!""--repeated Mr. Knightley.--""Emma, that I fear is aword--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--Ihave gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept youroffer--Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself toyou as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?""He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expressionof his eyes overpowered her.""My dearest Emma,"" said he, ""for dearest you will always be, whateverthe event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most belovedEmma--tell me at once. Say 'No,' if it is to be said.""--She couldreally say nothing.--""You are silent,"" he cried, with great animation;""absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.""Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. Thedread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the mostprominent feeling.""I cannot make speeches, Emma:"" he soon resumed; and in a tone ofsuch sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerablyconvincing.--""If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about itmore. But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--Ihave blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no otherwoman in England would have borne it.--Bear with the truths I wouldtell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. Themanner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I havebeen a very indifferent lover.--But you understand me.--Yes, you see,you understand my feelings--and will return them if you can. At present,I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.""While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderfulvelocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--tocatch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet'shopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete adelusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing; that she was everything herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriethad been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that heragitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been allreceived as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there timefor these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; therewas time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, andto resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the serviceshe could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism ofsentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer hisaffection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of thetwo--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him atonce and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could notmarry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain andwith contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all thatcould be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led herfriend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but herjudgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had everbeen before, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequaland degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She spokethen, on being so entreated.--What did she say?--Just what she ought,of course. A lady always does.--She said enough to shew there need notbe despair--and to invite him to say more himself. He _had_ despaired atone period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence,as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hearhim.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal oftaking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she hadjust put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!--She felt itsinconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it,and seek no farther explanation.Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or alittle mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct ismistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--Mr.Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than shepossessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He hadfollowed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with noselfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him anopening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work ofthe moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. Thedelightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill,of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birthto the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;--butit had been no present hope--he had only, in the momentary conquest ofeagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid hisattempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened wereso much the more enchanting.--The affection, which he had been askingto be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!--Within halfan hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, tosomething so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name._Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the sameprecious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the samedegree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side, there had beena long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of FrankChurchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probablyenlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchillthat had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decidedhim on going away. He would save himself from witnessing againsuch permitted, encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to beindifferent.--But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too muchdomestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a formin it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those strikinginferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy beforehim, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He hadstayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning'spost had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the gladnesswhich must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having neverbelieved Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so muchfond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay nolonger. He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directlyafter dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures,faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--He heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill'scharacter was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of FrankChurchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow."
Emma,50,"CHAPTER XIVWhat totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house fromwhat she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope fora little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite flutter ofhappiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still begreater when the flutter should have passed away.They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--how oftenit had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen on the sameshrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of thewestern sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thinglike it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of herusual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentivedaughter.Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in thebreast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiouslyhoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he have seen theheart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without themost distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightestperception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either,he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he hadreceived from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment,totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised andsubdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the taxfor such an evening, she found one or two such very serious pointsto consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have somealloy. Her father--and Harriet. She could not be alone without feelingthe full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfortof both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father,it was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightleywould ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the mostsolemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept overthe idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only anengagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger ofdrawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--Howto do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--how to spareher from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;how to appear least her enemy?--On these subjects, her perplexityand distress were very great--and her mind had to pass again andagain through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had eversurrounded it.--She could only resolve at last, that she would stillavoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told byletter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removedjust now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one schememore--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitationfor her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--She didnot think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by noveltyand variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--At any rate,it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whomevery thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of theevil day, when they must all be together again.She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment whichleft her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walkingup to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and halfan hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in aproper share of the happiness of the evening before.He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have theslightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter wasbrought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed what itmust contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--She was nowin perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, shewanted only to have her thoughts to herself--and as for understandingany thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must bewaded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;--anote from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank toMrs. Weston.""I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you theenclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcelya doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagreeabout the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--Weare quite well.--This letter has been the cure of all the littlenervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your lookson Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will neverown being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-eastwind.--I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesdayafternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing lastnight, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.                              ""Yours ever,                                                       ""A. W.""                       [To Mrs. Weston.]                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.MY DEAR MADAM,""If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will beexpected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour andindulgence.--You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need ofeven all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--ButI have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My couragerises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to behumble. I have already met with such success in two applications forpardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--Youmust all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when Ifirst arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret whichwas to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to placemyself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it a right,I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, andcasements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; mydifficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known torequire definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before weparted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in thecreation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--Had she refused, Ishould have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was yourhope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--To any thing, everything--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility ofgood was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining herpromises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther explanation,I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, andthe advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which noinheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--Seeme, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit toRandalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might havebeen sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come tillMiss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, youwill forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, byreminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so longI lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, during the veryhappy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open toreprehension, excepting on one point. And now I come to the principal,the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, whichexcites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation. Withthe greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention MissWoodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepesthumiliation.--A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke hisopinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviourto Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order toassist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more thanan allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediatelythrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--butI am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not beenconvinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by anyselfish views to go on.--Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; andthat she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me,was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions withan easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.We seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, thoseattentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhousebegan really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight,I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her, I remember that I waswithin a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was notwithout suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me,at least in some degree.--She may not have surmised the whole, but herquickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find,whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that itdid not take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it.I remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitudefor her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--I hope this history of my conducttowards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuationof what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned againstEmma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, andprocure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishesof that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherlyaffection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love asmyself.--Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was toget my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--Ofthe pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, thatits being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would neverhave allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--Thedelicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam,is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestlyhope, know her thoroughly yourself.--No description can describe her.She must tell you herself what she is--yet not by word, for neverwas there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her ownmerit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,I have heard from her.--She gives a good account of her own health; butas she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinionof her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dreadof the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you withoutdelay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how fewminutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: andI am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness ormisery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of herexcellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how littleI deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see heragain!--But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for meto encroach.--I must still add to this long letter. You have not heardall that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detailyesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonablenesswith which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the eventof the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me thehappiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures,but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour tolose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and shewould have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength andrefinement.--But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had enteredinto with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave offabruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking overthe country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest ofmy letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifyingretrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, thatmy manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highlyblameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--Myplea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She wasdispleased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousandoccasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her evencold. But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, andsubdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should haveescaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every littledissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late;I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but shewould not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I thenthought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a verynatural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind theworld to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionableparticularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to aproposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had webeen met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth musthave been suspected.--I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubtedher affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglectof her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have beenimpossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment ina form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--In short, my dearmadam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; andI returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid withyou till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry withher as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean tobe reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by hercoldness, and I went away determined that she should make the firstadvances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not ofthe Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardlysuppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect uponher appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as shefound I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of thatofficious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by thebye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrelwith a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towardsmyself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of itwhich that woman has known.--'Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that Ihave not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.Think, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied betweenthe Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all theinsolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soonhave done.--She closed with this offer, resolving to break with meentirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meetagain.--_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of__repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--Thisletter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. Ianswered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and themultiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead ofbeing sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up inmy writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though buta few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I wasrather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but Imade excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--too cheerfulin my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and twodays afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters allreturned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating herextreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; andadding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued,and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinatearrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safeconveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directlycommand hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I wouldforward them after that period to her at--: in short, the full directionto Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew thename, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she hadbeen doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of characterwhich I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as toany such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of itsanxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to threatenme.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected myown blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--What was to bedone?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction Icould not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances werein my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was,earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying;and could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished Imight find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--Ifelt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pityme for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for mysuspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reachedHighbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity me till I saw herwan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from myknowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chanceof finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was notdisappointed either in the object of my journey. A great deal of veryreasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. But it isdone; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment'suneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my dear madam, I willrelease you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and a thousandthanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand forthe attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me ina way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--MissW. calls me the child of good fortune. I hope she is right.--In onerespect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribemyself,                    Your obliged and affectionate Son,                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL."
Emma,51,"CHAPTER XVThis letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged, inspite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all thejustice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subjectcould still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regardfor the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture oflove must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till she had gonethrough the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he hadbeen wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he hadsuffered, and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, andso much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, thatthere was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she musthave shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it tobe communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen somuch to blame in his conduct.""I shall be very glad to look it over,"" said he; ""but it seems long. Iwill take it home with me at night.""But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and shemust return it by him.""I would rather be talking to you,"" he replied; ""but as it seems amatter of justice, it shall be done.""He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, ""Had I been offeredthe sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a fewmonths ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.""He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with asmile, observed, ""Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is hisway. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not besevere.""""It will be natural for me,"" he added shortly afterwards, ""to speak myopinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--""""Not at all. I should wish it.""Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.""He trifles here,"" said he, ""as to the temptation. He knows he is wrong,and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed theengagement.--'His father's disposition:'--he is unjust, however, to hisfather. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his uprightand honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfortbefore he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till MissFairfax was here.""""And I have not forgotten,"" said Emma, ""how sure you were that he mighthave come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely--but youwere perfectly right.""""I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had_you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.""When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of italoud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of thehead; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, asthe subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steadyreflection, thus--""Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerousgame. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--No judge ofhis own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, andregardless of little besides his own convenience.--Fancying you to havefathomed his secret. Natural enough!--his own mind full of intrigue,that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervertthe understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove moreand more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with eachother?""Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,which she could not give any sincere explanation of.""You had better go on,"" said she.He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, ""the pianoforte! Ah! Thatwas the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whetherthe inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. Aboyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give awoman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispensewith; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument'scoming if she could.""After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill'sconfession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call formore than a word in passing.""I perfectly agree with you, sir,""--was then his remark. ""You did behavevery shamefully. You never wrote a truer line."" And having gone throughwhat immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and hispersisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right,he made a fuller pause to say, ""This is very bad.--He had induced herto place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty anduneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her fromsuffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contendwith, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should haverespected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers wereall reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that shehad done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that sheshould have been in such a state of punishment.""Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grewuncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She wasdeeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fearof giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.""There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, theEltons,"" was his next observation.--""His feelings are natural.--What!actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement tobe a source of repentance and misery to each--she dissolved it.--What aview this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well, he must be a mostextraordinary--""""Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.""""I hope he does,"" replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.""'Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all this?""""She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--adear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by thebye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?""""Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even ofMrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letterthe man writes!""""I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.""""Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered infinding her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond ofher. 'Dearer, much dearer than ever.' I hope he may long continue tofeel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberalthanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.--'Happier than Ideserve.' Come, he knows himself there. 'Miss Woodhouse calls me thechild of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--And a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!That was your name for him, was it?""""You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but stillyou must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. Ihope it does him some service with you.""""Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults ofinconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinionin thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as heis, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, itmay be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am veryready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers thesteadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talkto you of something else. I have another person's interest at presentso much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at workon one subject.""The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlikeEnglish, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in lovewith, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking thehappiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word.""While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossiblefor her. She could never quit him."" Part only of this answer, however,was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr.Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of anyother change, he could not agree to. He had been thinking it over mostdeeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse toremove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, buthis knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himselflong; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantationwould be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, whichmust not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he feltthat it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on thesacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in anyrespect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield;that so long as her father's happiness--in other words, his life--requiredHartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passingthoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but suchan alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of allthe affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he mustbe sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; thatin living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, therewould be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it,and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that noreflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He hadgiven it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he hadbeen walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have histhoughts to himself.""Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,"" cried Emma. ""I am sureWilliam Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before youask mine.""She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very goodscheme.It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view inwhich she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was neverstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights asheir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she mustof the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she onlygave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement indetecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley'smarrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she hadwholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing atHartfield--the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutualgood to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in theperiods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--Such a partner inall those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase ofmelancholy!She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessingof her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful familyparty which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in merecharitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser inevery way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deductionfrom her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather adead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed apeculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state ofunmerited punishment.In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--notlike Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so trulyconsiderate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshippedthan now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that shecould be in love with more than _three_ men in one year."
Emma,52,"CHAPTER XVIIt was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous asherself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough byletter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, withoutreproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied therewas a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style,which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--It might beonly her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could havebeen quite without resentment under such a stroke.She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she wasfortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resortingto invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, andhad wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley wasdelighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation toher--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she wasquite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settledon her sister's side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found hervery persuadable.--Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least afortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It wasall arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in BrunswickSquare.Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she couldtalk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that senseof injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted herwhen remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much mightat that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelingswhich she had led astray herself.The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhapsan unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not thinkof her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which mustbe averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the placein her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication beforeher, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--the confession ofher engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with itat present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Westonwere safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at thisperiod among those she loved--and the evil should not act on herselfby anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, ofleisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating,delight, should be hers.She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half anhour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--She oughtto go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their presentsituations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospectwould certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to anything Jane might communicate.She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had notbeen into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane hadbeen in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all theworst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being stillunwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, towait in the passage, and send up her name.--She heard Patty announcingit; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made sohappily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of,""Beg her to walk up;""--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairsby Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of herwere felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely,so engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there wasevery thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but veryfeeling tone,""This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for meto express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirelywithout words.""Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if thesound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checkedher, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all hercongratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, whichaccounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with everybody; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped therencontre would do them no harm.She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, andunderstand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being inMiss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what wasstill a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately inthe expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs.Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she sawher with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which shehad apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it intothe purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,""We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not wantopportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. Ionly wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and isnot offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweetcreature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.--But not a wordmore. Let us be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--Youremember those lines--I forget the poem at this moment:        ""For when a lady's in the case,        ""You know all other things give place.""Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word tothe wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I? But I want to setyour heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, hasquite appeased her.""And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates'sknitting, she added, in a half whisper,""I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as aminister of state. I managed it extremely well.""Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on everypossible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony ofthe weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,""Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here ischarmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highestcredit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon myword, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--Oh! if you hadseen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!""--And when Mrs. Bateswas saying something to Emma, whispered farther, ""We do not say a wordof any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain youngphysician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.""""I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,"" sheshortly afterwards began, ""since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasantparty. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did notseem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--Soit appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I thinkit answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to ourcollecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while thefine weather lasts?--It must be the same party, you know, quite thesame party, not _one_ exception.""Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help beingdiverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to sayevery thing.""Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossibleto say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--thatis, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--How is Mr.Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--Such a happy littlecircle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--Charming young man!--thatis--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--such attention toJane!""--And from her great, her more than commonly thankful delighttowards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been alittle show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter,which was now graciously overcome.--After a few whispers, indeed, whichplaced it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,""Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, thatanywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truthis, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join mehere, and pay his respects to you.""""What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--That willbe a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, andMr. Elton's time is so engaged.""""Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning tonight.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence orother.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are alwayswanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing withouthim.--'Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, 'rather you than I.--I donot know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I hadhalf so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglectthem both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a barthis fortnight.--However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, onpurpose to wait on you all."" And putting up her hand to screen herwords from Emma--""A congratulatory visit, you know.--Oh! yes, quiteindispensable.""Miss Bates looked about her, so happily--!""He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himselffrom Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deepconsultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand.""Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, ""Is Mr. Eltongone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.""""Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston andCole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those wholead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.""""Have not you mistaken the day?"" said Emma. ""I am almost certain thatthe meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley was atHartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.""""Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,"" was the abrupt answer, whichdenoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--""I dobelieve,"" she continued, ""this is the most troublesome parish that everwas. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.""""Your parish there was small,"" said Jane.""Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subjecttalked of.""""But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heardyou speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; theonly school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.""""Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brain youhave! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if wecould be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produceperfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that _some_people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--not a word,if you please.""It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was veryevident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of hersparkling vivacity.""Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be anencumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--Butyou knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I shouldnot stir till my lord and master appeared.--Here have I been sittingthis hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugalobedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?""Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequentobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and thewalk he had had for nothing.""When I got to Donwell,"" said he, ""Knightley could not be found. Veryodd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and themessage he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.""""Donwell!"" cried his wife.--""My dear Mr. E., you have not been toDonwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.""""No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightleyto-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--I wentover the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which madeit so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure youI am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. Thehousekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--Veryextraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhapsto Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--MissWoodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it?""Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.""I cannot imagine,"" said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wifeought to do,) ""I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, ofall people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect tobe forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I amsure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--and hisservants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likelyto happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed,extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such acreature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. Andas for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promisedWright a receipt, and never sent it.""""I met William Larkins,"" continued Mr. Elton, ""as I got near the house,and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did notbelieve him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know whatwas come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get thespeech of him. I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it reallyis of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to-day; and itbecomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I shouldhave had this hot walk to no purpose.""Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. Inall probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towardsMr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined toattend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave heran opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,""It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had younot been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted tointroduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than mighthave been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have beenimpertinent.""""Oh!"" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thoughtinfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usualcomposure--""there would have been no danger. The danger would havebeen of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more thanby expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking morecollectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, verygreat misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that thoseof my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are notdisgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I couldwish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something formyself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if yourcompassion does not stand my friend--""""Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,"" cried Emma warmly, andtaking her hand. ""You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom youmight be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delightedeven--""""You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--Socold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life ofdeceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.""""Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be donequickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope youhave pleasant accounts from Windsor?""""Very.""""And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--just asI begin to know you.""""Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am heretill claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.""""Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,"" replied Emma,smiling--""but, excuse me, it must be thought of.""The smile was returned as Jane answered,""You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (Iam sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchillat Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, ofdeep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothingmore to wait for.""""Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assuredof.--Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided andopen!--Good-bye, good-bye."""
Emma,53,"CHAPTER XVIIMrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if thesatisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was byknowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided inwishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was withany view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella'ssons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both fatherand mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grewolder--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--tohave his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaksand the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--noone could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would bequite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not havetheir powers in exercise again.""She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,"" shecontinued--""like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in Madamede Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own littleAdelaide educated on a more perfect plan.""""That is,"" replied Mr. Knightley, ""she will indulge her even more thanshe did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It willbe the only difference.""""Poor child!"" cried Emma; ""at that rate, what will become of her?""""Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeablein infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all mybitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing allmy happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to besevere on them?""Emma laughed, and replied: ""But I had the assistance of all yourendeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whethermy own sense would have corrected me without it.""""Do you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:--Miss Taylorgave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quiteas likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, whatright has he to lecture me?--and I am afraid very natural for you tofeel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I didyou any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of thetenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much withoutdoating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.""""I am sure you were of use to me,"" cried Emma. ""I was very ofteninfluenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. Iam very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to bespoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for heras you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she isthirteen.""""How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of yoursaucy looks--'Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says Imay, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, Idid not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two badfeelings instead of one.""""What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speechesin such affectionate remembrance.""""'Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, 'Mr. Knightley;' and, fromhabit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. I wantyou to call me something else, but I do not know what.""""I remember once calling you 'George,' in one of my amiable fits, aboutten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, asyou made no objection, I never did it again.""""And cannot you call me 'George' now?""""Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but 'Mr. Knightley.' Iwill not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, bycalling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,"" she added presently, laughingand blushing--""I will promise to call you once by your Christian name.I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building inwhich N. takes M. for better, for worse.""Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one importantservice which his better sense would have rendered her, to theadvice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanlyfollies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender asubject.--She could not enter on it.--Harriet was very seldom mentionedbetween them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not beingthought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy,and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship weredeclining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any othercircumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and thather intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, onIsabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of beingobliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior tothe pain of having made Harriet unhappy.Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could beexpected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, whichappeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but,since that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harrietdifferent from what she had known her before.--Isabella, to be sure,was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playingwith the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts andhopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer;her fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. JohnKnightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remaintill they could bring her back.""John does not even mention your friend,"" said Mr. Knightley. ""Here ishis answer, if you like to see it.""It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emmaaccepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to knowwhat he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that herfriend was unmentioned.""John enters like a brother into my happiness,"" continued Mr. Knightley,""but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from makingflourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool inher praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.""""He writes like a sensible man,"" replied Emma, when she had read theletter. ""I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers thegood fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is notwithout hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, asyou think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a differentconstruction, I should not have believed him.""""My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means--""""He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,""interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--""much less, perhaps, thanhe is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on thesubject.""""Emma, my dear Emma--""""Oh!"" she cried with more thorough gaiety, ""if you fancy your brotherdoes not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing_you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, onyour side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may notsink into 'poor Emma' with him at once.--His tender compassion towardsoppressed worth can go no farther.""""Ah!"" he cried, ""I wish your father might be half as easily convinced asJohn will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to behappy together. I am amused by one part of John's letter--did you noticeit?--where he says, that my information did not take him wholly bysurprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of thekind.""""If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your havingsome thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectlyunprepared for that.""""Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into myfeelings. What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of anydifference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him atthis time for my marrying any more than at another.--But it was so, Isuppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with themthe other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so muchas usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, 'Uncle seemsalways tired now.'""The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and otherpersons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficientlyrecovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view thather gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first toannounce it at home, and then at Randalls.--But how to break it to herfather at last!--She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would havefailed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to comeat such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She wasforced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it amore decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits shecould command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could beobtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--she and Mr.Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive theconstant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved, nextto his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he triedearnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, ofhaving always said she would never marry, and assured that it would bea great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella,and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. Emma hung about himaffectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he mustnot class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking themfrom Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was notgoing from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducingno change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and shewas very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr.Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.--Didhe not love Mr. Knightley very much?--He would not deny that he did,she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.Knightley?--Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters,who so glad to assist him?--Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attachedto him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes. Thatwas all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he shouldbe glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as itwas.--Why could not they go on as they had done?Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--ToEmma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fondpraise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soonused to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--They had allthe assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongestapprobation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, toconsider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, as a settled,and, secondly, as a good one--well aware of the nearly equal importanceof the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreedupon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to beguided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having somefeelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that sometime or other--in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so verybad if the marriage did take place.Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that shesaid to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but shesaw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple inurging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, asto think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respectso proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in onerespect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safelyhave attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herselfbeen the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished itlong ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emmawould have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make suchan arrangement desirable!--The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, fora marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombeand Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr.Weston than by herself--but even he had never been able to finishthe subject better than by saying--""Those matters will take care ofthemselves; the young people will find a way."" But here there wasnothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It wasall right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name.It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and withoutone real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflectionsas these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing couldincrease her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon haveoutgrown its first set of caps.The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Westonhad his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough tofamiliarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--He saw the advantagesof the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife;but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour hewas not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.""It is to be a secret, I conclude,"" said he. ""These matters are always asecret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me betold when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.""He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on thatpoint. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldestdaughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed,of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediatelyafterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; theyhad calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon itwould be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the eveningwonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, andothers might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend theirall removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys;and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet,upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in onehabitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by anysatisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife;he only hoped ""the young lady's pride would now be contented;"" andsupposed ""she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;"" and,on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, ""Ratherhe than I!""--But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--""PoorKnightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him.""--She was extremelyconcerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand goodqualities.--How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all inlove--not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of allpleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dinewith them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.--Poorfellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh!no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on everything.--Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry thatshe had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, livingtogether. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove whohad tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the firstquarter."
Emma,54,"CHAPTER XVIIITime passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London wouldbe arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it onemorning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, whenMr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After thefirst chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, beganwith,""I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.""""Good or bad?"" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.""I do not know which it ought to be called.""""Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying notto smile.""""I am afraid,"" said he, composing his features, ""I am very much afraid,my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.""""Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleasesor amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.""""There is one subject,"" he replied, ""I hope but one, on which we do notthink alike."" He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed onher face. ""Does nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--HarrietSmith.""Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, thoughshe knew not what.""Have you heard from her yourself this morning?"" cried he. ""You have, Ibelieve, and know the whole.""""No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.""""You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. HarrietSmith marries Robert Martin.""Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her eyes,in eager gaze, said, ""No, this is impossible!"" but her lips were closed.""It is so, indeed,"" continued Mr. Knightley; ""I have it from RobertMartin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.""She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.""You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions werethe same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make oneor the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need nottalk much on the subject.""""You mistake me, you quite mistake me,"" she replied, exerting herself.""It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but Icannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say,that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that hehas even proposed to her again--yet. You only mean, that he intends it.""""I mean that he has done it,"" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling butdetermined decision, ""and been accepted.""""Good God!"" she cried.--""Well!""--Then having recourse to her workbasket,in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisitefeelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must beexpressing, she added, ""Well, now tell me every thing; make thisintelligible to me. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never wasmore surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--howhas it been possible?""""It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to sendto John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and wasasked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They weregoing to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be ourbrother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert couldnot resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused;and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day--which hedid--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found anopportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speakin vain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he isdeserving. He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me thismorning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, firston my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate ofthe how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a muchlonger history when you see her.--She will give you all the minuteparticulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In ourcommunications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, thatRobert Martin's heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing;and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, thaton quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. JohnKnightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smithrather uneasy.""He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, shewas sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence disturbedhim; and after observing her a little while, he added,""Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make youunhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. Hissituation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies yourfriend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of himas you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delightyou.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friendin better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which issaying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about WilliamLarkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.""He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself notto smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,""You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I thinkHarriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that theyare. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. Youcannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unpreparedI was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determinedagainst him, much more, than she was before.""""You ought to know your friend best,"" replied Mr. Knightley; ""but Ishould say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to bevery, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.""Emma could not help laughing as she answered, ""Upon my word, I believeyou know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are youperfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him.I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--Did not youmisunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; of business,shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion ofso many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet's hand that he wascertain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox.""The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and RobertMartin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strongwas the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet'sside, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis,""No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,"" that she wasreally expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.It could not be otherwise.""Do you dare say this?"" cried Mr. Knightley. ""Do you dare to suppose meso great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What doyou deserve?""""Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up withany other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Areyou quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin andHarriet now are?""""I am quite sure,"" he replied, speaking very distinctly, ""that hetold me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothingdoubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof thatit must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knewof no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information ofher relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done,than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, hesaid, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.""""I am perfectly satisfied,"" replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,""and most sincerely wish them happy.""""You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.""""I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.""""And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you allHarriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and forRobert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as muchin love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have oftentalked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes,indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poorMartin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations,I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very goodnotions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness inthe affections and utility of domestic life.--Much of this, I have nodoubt, she may thank you for.""""Me!"" cried Emma, shaking her head.--""Ah! poor Harriet!""She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little morepraise than she deserved.Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of herfather. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in astate of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to becollected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till shehad moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, shecould be fit for nothing rational.Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put thehorses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and shehad, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may beimagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect ofHarriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy forsecurity.--What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy ofhim, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own.Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humilityand circumspection in future.Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in herresolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in thevery midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of thedoleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be apleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was thereflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley wouldsoon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her topractise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving himthat full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready towelcome as a duty.In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; notalways listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether inspeech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of hisbeing obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would bedisappointed.They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardlyhad they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanksfor coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through theblind, of two figures passing near the window.""It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,"" said Mrs. Weston. ""I was just going totell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. Hestays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend theday with us.--They are coming in, I hope.""In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad tosee him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassingrecollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with aconsciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having allsat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, thatEmma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had longfelt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane,would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined theparty, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer awant of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for FrankChurchill to draw near her and say,""I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving messagein one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you lesswilling to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.""""No, indeed,"" cried Emma, most happy to begin, ""not in the least. I amparticularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joyin person.""He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak withserious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.""Is not she looking well?"" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.""Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Westondoat upon her.""But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, aftermentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name ofDixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.""I can never think of it,"" she cried, ""without extreme shame.""""The shame,"" he answered, ""is all mine, or ought to be. But is itpossible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, youhad none.""""I never had the smallest, I assure you.""""That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish Ihad--it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrongthings, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me noservice.--It would have been a much better transgression had I brokenthe bond of secrecy and told you every thing.""""It is not now worth a regret,"" said Emma.""I have some hope,"" resumed he, ""of my uncle's being persuaded to pay avisit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbellsare returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,till we may carry her northward.--But now, I am at such a distance fromher--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--Till this morning, we have notonce met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?""Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gaythought, he cried,""Ah! by the bye,"" then sinking his voice, and looking demure for themoment--""I hope Mr. Knightley is well?"" He paused.--She coloured andlaughed.--""I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wishin your favour. Let me return your congratulations.--I assure you thatI have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He isa man whom I cannot presume to praise.""Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; buthis mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,and his next words were,""Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--andyet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair. It is amost uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--a mostdistinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colourenough for beauty.""""I have always admired her complexion,"" replied Emma, archly; ""butdo not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being sopale?--When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?""""Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--""But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not helpsaying,""I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, youhad very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I amsure it was a consolation to you.""""Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the mostmiserable wretch!""""Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was asource of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking usall in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you thetruth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the samesituation. I think there is a little likeness between us.""He bowed.""If not in our dispositions,"" she presently added, with a look of truesensibility, ""there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bidsfair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.""""True, true,"" he answered, warmly. ""No, not true on your side. You canhave no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel. Lookat her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of herthroat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--You willbe glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that myuncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set.I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it bebeautiful in her dark hair?""""Very beautiful, indeed,"" replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that hegratefully burst out,""How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellentlooks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I shouldcertainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.""The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an accountof a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from theinfant's appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sendingfor Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had beenalmost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child hadbeen perfectly well again. This was her history; and particularlyinteresting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much forthinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not doneit. ""She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in theslightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not betoo soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps,that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry hadseen it.""Frank Churchill caught the name.""Perry!"" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch MissFairfax's eye. ""My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Hashe set up his carriage?""Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in thelaugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too was reallyhearing him, though trying to seem deaf.""Such an extraordinary dream of mine!"" he cried. ""I can never think ofit without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I seeit in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Donot you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--that the wholeblunder is spread before her--that she can attend to nothing else,though pretending to listen to the others?""Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partlyremained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yetsteady voice,""How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They_will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!""He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; butEmma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leavingRandalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, shefelt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and reallyregarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been moresensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. The happinessof this most happy day, received its completion, in the animatedcontemplation of his worth which this comparison produced."
Emma,55,"CHAPTER XIXIf Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, amomentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of herattachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man fromunbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from therecurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the partyfrom London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one houralone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountableas it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,and was now forming all her views of happiness.Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, andself-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away withthe words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with thefullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend'sapprobation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, bymeeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--Harriet wasmost happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and thedinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.But what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could nowacknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that hiscontinuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must everbe unintelligible to Emma.The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her freshreason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known. She provedto be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her thecomfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough tohave always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentilitywhich Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely tobe as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but whata connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for theChurchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy,unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treatedliberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquaintedwith Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fullyacknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which couldbid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet'shappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home heoffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, andimprovement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety,and occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led intotemptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectableand happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in theworld, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such aman;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--Theintimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must changeinto a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be,and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, naturalmanner.Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and sawher hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, asno remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall onherself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged ofthe three, were the first to be married.Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to thecomforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchillswere also in town; and they were only waiting for November.The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, byEmma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage oughtto be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, toallow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which wasthe plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed inapproving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be inducedto consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as adistant event.When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they werealmost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--Hebegan to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--a verypromising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, hewas not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter'scourage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to knowhim fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almostacquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that whenonce the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, shehesitated--she could not proceed.In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any suddenillumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of hisnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in anotherway.--Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all herturkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards inthe neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of hisson-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm everynight of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of theMr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of themprotected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley mustbe in London again by the end of the first week in November.The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at themoment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was calledon, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, tojoin the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties haveno taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particularsdetailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and veryinferior to her own.--""Very little white satin, very few lace veils; amost pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it.""--But,in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed theceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.FINIS"

Northanger Abbey,1,"CHAPTER 1No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would havesupposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the characterof her father and mother, her own person and disposition, wereall equally against her. Her father was a clergyman, without beingneglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his namewas Richard--and he had never been handsome. He had a considerableindependence besides two good livings--and he was not in the leastaddicted to locking up his daughters. Her mother was a woman of usefulplain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with agood constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; andinstead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody mightexpect, she still lived on--lived to have six children more--to see themgrowing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself. A familyof ten children will be always called a fine family, where there areheads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands hadlittle other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, andCatherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any. She had a thinawkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strongfeatures--so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for heroismseemed her mind. She was fond of all boy's plays, and greatly preferredcricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments ofinfancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering arose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gatheredflowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief--at leastso it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she wasforbidden to take. Such were her propensities--her abilities were quiteas extraordinary. She never could learn or understand anythingbefore she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was ofteninattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her mother was three months inteaching her only to repeat the ""Beggar's Petition""; and after all, hernext sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that Catherinewas always stupid--by no means; she learnt the fable of ""The Hare andMany Friends"" as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother wished herto learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she wasvery fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eightyears old she began. She learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs.Morland, who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished inspite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off. The day whichdismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine's life.Her taste for drawing was not superior; though whenever she could obtainthe outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other oddpiece of paper, she did what she could in that way, by drawing housesand trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another. Writingand accounts she was taught by her father; French by her mother: herproficiency in either was not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons inboth whenever she could. What a strange, unaccountable character!--forwith all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she had neithera bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely everquarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptionsof tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement andcleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down thegreen slope at the back of the house.Such was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending;she began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved,her features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained moreanimation, and her figure more consequence. Her love of dirt gave way toan inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she hadnow the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remarkon her personal improvement. ""Catherine grows quite a good-lookinggirl--she is almost pretty today,"" were words which caught her ears nowand then; and how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is anacquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain thefirst fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can everreceive.Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her childreneverything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied inlying-in and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters wereinevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderfulthat Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, shouldprefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running aboutthe country at the age of fourteen, to books--or at least books ofinformation--for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could begained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, shehad never any objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeenshe was in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroinesmust read to supply their memories with those quotations which are soserviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.From Pope, she learnt to censure those who   ""bear about the mockery of woe.""From Gray, that   ""Many a flower is born to blush unseen,   ""And waste its fragrance on the desert air.""From Thompson, that--   ""It is a delightful task   ""To teach the young idea how to shoot.""And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information--amongstthe rest, that--   ""Trifles light as air,   ""Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong,   ""As proofs of Holy Writ.""That   ""The poor beetle, which we tread upon,   ""In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great   ""As when a giant dies.""And that a young woman in love always looks--   ""like Patience on a monument   ""Smiling at Grief.""So far her improvement was sufficient--and in many other points she cameon exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she broughtherself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwinga whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her owncomposition, she could listen to other people's performance with verylittle fatigue. Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil--she had nonotion of drawing--not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover'sprofile, that she might be detected in the design. There she fellmiserably short of the true heroic height. At present she did not knowher own poverty, for she had no lover to portray. She had reached theage of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could callforth her sensibility, without having inspired one real passion, andwithout having excited even any admiration but what was very moderateand very transient. This was strange indeed! But strange things may begenerally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out. There wasnot one lord in the neighbourhood; no--not even a baronet. There was notone family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boyaccidentally found at their door--not one young man whose originwas unknown. Her father had no ward, and the squire of the parish nochildren.But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of fortysurrounding families cannot prevent her. Something must and will happento throw a hero in her way.Mr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, thevillage in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bathfor the benefit of a gouty constitution--and his lady, a good-humouredwoman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures willnot befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad,invited her to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance,and Catherine all happiness."
Northanger Abbey,2,"CHAPTER 2In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland'spersonal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all thedifficulties and dangers of a six weeks' residence in Bath, it may bestated, for the reader's more certain information, lest the followingpages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character ismeant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition cheerfuland open, without conceit or affectation of any kind--her manners justremoved from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her person pleasing,and, when in good looks, pretty--and her mind about as ignorant anduninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is.When the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs.Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe. A thousandalarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from thisterrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown herin tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice ofthe most important and applicable nature must of course flow from herwise lips in their parting conference in her closet. Cautions againstthe violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing youngladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relievethe fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knewso little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of theirgeneral mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to herdaughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to thefollowing points. ""I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself upvery warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; andI wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I willgive you this little book on purpose.""Sally, or rather Sarah (for what young lady of common gentility willreach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can?),must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidanteof her sister. It is remarkable, however, that she neither insistedon Catherine's writing by every post, nor exacted her promise oftransmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detailof every interesting conversation that Bath might produce. Everythingindeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of theMorlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemedrather consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with therefined susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first separationof a heroine from her family ought always to excite. Her father, insteadof giving her an unlimited order on his banker, or even putting anhundred pounds bank-bill into her hands, gave her only ten guineas, andpromised her more when she wanted it.Under these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and thejourney began. It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventfulsafety. Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one luckyoverturn to introduce them to the hero. Nothing more alarming occurredthan a fear, on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her clogs behindher at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.They arrived at Bath. Catherine was all eager delight--her eyes werehere, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and strikingenvirons, and afterwards drove through those streets which conductedthem to the hotel. She was come to be happy, and she felt happy already.They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street.It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen, that thereader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereaftertend to promote the general distress of the work, and how she will,probably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperatewretchedness of which a last volume is capable--whether by herimprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy--whether by intercepting her letters,ruining her character, or turning her out of doors.Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society canraise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the worldwho could like them well enough to marry them. She had neither beauty,genius, accomplishment, nor manner. The air of a gentlewoman, a greatdeal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a trifling turn of mindwere all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible,intelligent man like Mr. Allen. In one respect she was admirably fittedto introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going everywhereand seeing everything herself as any young lady could be. Dress washer passion. She had a most harmless delight in being fine; and ourheroine's entree into life could not take place till after three or fourdays had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and her chaperonewas provided with a dress of the newest fashion. Catherine too madesome purchases herself, and when all these matters were arranged, theimportant evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms. Herhair was cut and dressed by the best hand, her clothes put on with care,and both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she shoulddo. With such encouragement, Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensuredthrough the crowd. As for admiration, it was always very welcome when itcame, but she did not depend on it.Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroomtill late. The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladiessqueezed in as well as they could. As for Mr. Allen, he repaireddirectly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves.With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort ofher protegee, Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men bythe door, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine,however, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too firmly withinher friend's to be torn asunder by any common effort of a strugglingassembly. But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along theroom was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd; itseemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had imagined thatwhen once fairly within the door, they should easily find seats and beable to watch the dances with perfect convenience. But this was far frombeing the case, and though by unwearied diligence they gained even thetop of the room, their situation was just the same; they saw nothingof the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies. Still theymoved on--something better was yet in view; and by a continued exertionof strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passagebehind the highest bench. Here there was something less of crowd thanbelow; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all thecompany beneath her, and of all the dangers of her late passage throughthem. It was a splendid sight, and she began, for the first time thatevening, to feel herself at a ball: she longed to dance, but she hadnot an acquaintance in the room. Mrs. Allen did all that she could doin such a case by saying very placidly, every now and then, ""I wish youcould dance, my dear--I wish you could get a partner."" For some timeher young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes; but they wererepeated so often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that Catherinegrew tired at last, and would thank her no more.They were not long able, however, to enjoy the repose of the eminencethey had so laboriously gained. Everybody was shortly in motion fortea, and they must squeeze out like the rest. Catherine began to feelsomething of disappointment--she was tired of being continually pressedagainst by people, the generality of whose faces possessed nothing tointerest, and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that shecould not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of asyllable with any of her fellow captives; and when at last arrived inthe tea-room, she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party tojoin, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist them. They sawnothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain for a moreeligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a table, atwhich a large party were already placed, without having anything to dothere, or anybody to speak to, except each other.Mrs. Allen congratulated herself, as soon as they were seated, on havingpreserved her gown from injury. ""It would have been very shocking tohave it torn,"" said she, ""would not it? It is such a delicate muslin.For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, Iassure you.""""How uncomfortable it is,"" whispered Catherine, ""not to have a singleacquaintance here!""""Yes, my dear,"" replied Mrs. Allen, with perfect serenity, ""it is veryuncomfortable indeed.""""What shall we do? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as ifthey wondered why we came here--we seem forcing ourselves into theirparty.""""Aye, so we do. That is very disagreeable. I wish we had a largeacquaintance here.""""I wish we had any--it would be somebody to go to.""""Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly.The Skinners were here last year--I wish they were here now.""""Had not we better go away as it is? Here are no tea-things for us, yousee.""""No more there are, indeed. How very provoking! But I think we hadbetter sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd! How is myhead, my dear? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid.""""No, indeed, it looks very nice. But, dear Mrs. Allen, are you surethere is nobody you know in all this multitude of people? I think youmust know somebody.""""I don't, upon my word--I wish I did. I wish I had a large acquaintancehere with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner. I should beso glad to have you dance. There goes a strange-looking woman! What anodd gown she has got on! How old-fashioned it is! Look at the back.""After some time they received an offer of tea from one of theirneighbours; it was thankfully accepted, and this introduced a lightconversation with the gentleman who offered it, which was the only timethat anybody spoke to them during the evening, till they were discoveredand joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over.""Well, Miss Morland,"" said he, directly, ""I hope you have had anagreeable ball.""""Very agreeable indeed,"" she replied, vainly endeavouring to hide agreat yawn.""I wish she had been able to dance,"" said his wife; ""I wish we couldhave got a partner for her. I have been saying how glad I should be ifthe Skinners were here this winter instead of last; or if the Parrys hadcome, as they talked of once, she might have danced with George Parry. Iam so sorry she has not had a partner!""""We shall do better another evening I hope,"" was Mr. Allen'sconsolation.The company began to disperse when the dancing was over--enough to leavespace for the remainder to walk about in some comfort; and now was thetime for a heroine, who had not yet played a very distinguished partin the events of the evening, to be noticed and admired. Every fiveminutes, by removing some of the crowd, gave greater openings for hercharms. She was now seen by many young men who had not been near herbefore. Not one, however, started with rapturous wonder on beholdingher, no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room, nor was she oncecalled a divinity by anybody. Yet Catherine was in very good looks, andhad the company only seen her three years before, they would now havethought her exceedingly handsome.She was looked at, however, and with some admiration; for, in her ownhearing, two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl. Such wordshad their due effect; she immediately thought the evening pleasanterthan she had found it before--her humble vanity was contented--shefelt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than atrue-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebrationof her charms, and went to her chair in good humour with everybody, andperfectly satisfied with her share of public attention."
Northanger Abbey,3,"CHAPTER 3Every morning now brought its regular duties--shops were to be visited;some new part of the town to be looked at; and the pump-room to beattended, where they paraded up and down for an hour, looking ateverybody and speaking to no one. The wish of a numerous acquaintancein Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen, and she repeated it afterevery fresh proof, which every morning brought, of her knowing nobody atall.They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms; and here fortune was morefavourable to our heroine. The master of the ceremonies introduced toher a very gentlemanlike young man as a partner; his name was Tilney.He seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall, had apleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if notquite handsome, was very near it. His address was good, and Catherinefelt herself in high luck. There was little leisure for speakingwhile they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she found him asagreeable as she had already given him credit for being. He talked withfluency and spirit--and there was an archness and pleasantry in hismanner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her. Afterchatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objectsaround them, he suddenly addressed her with--""I have hitherto been veryremiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I have notyet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were ever herebefore; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, andthe concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have beenvery negligent--but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in theseparticulars? If you are I will begin directly.""""You need not give yourself that trouble, sir.""""No trouble, I assure you, madam."" Then forming his features into a setsmile, and affectedly softening his voice, he added, with a simperingair, ""Have you been long in Bath, madam?""""About a week, sir,"" replied Catherine, trying not to laugh.""Really!"" with affected astonishment.""Why should you be surprised, sir?""""Why, indeed!"" said he, in his natural tone. ""But some emotion mustappear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more easily assumed,and not less reasonable than any other. Now let us go on. Were you neverhere before, madam?""""Never, sir.""""Indeed! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?""""Yes, sir, I was there last Monday.""""Have you been to the theatre?""""Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday.""""To the concert?""""Yes, sir, on Wednesday.""""And are you altogether pleased with Bath?""""Yes--I like it very well.""""Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.""Catherine turned away her head, not knowing whether she might venture tolaugh. ""I see what you think of me,"" said he gravely--""I shall make buta poor figure in your journal tomorrow.""""My journal!""""Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the LowerRooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings--plain blackshoes--appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by aqueer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and distressedme by his nonsense.""""Indeed I shall say no such thing.""""Shall I tell you what you ought to say?""""If you please.""""I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; hada great deal of conversation with him--seems a most extraordinarygenius--hope I may know more of him. That, madam, is what I wish you tosay.""""But, perhaps, I keep no journal.""""Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am not sitting byyou. These are points in which a doubt is equally possible. Not keep ajournal! How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of yourlife in Bath without one? How are the civilities and compliments ofevery day to be related as they ought to be, unless noted down everyevening in a journal? How are your various dresses to be remembered,and the particular state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to bedescribed in all their diversities, without having constant recourse toa journal? My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies' ways asyou wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling whichlargely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladiesare so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of writingagreeable letters is peculiarly female. Nature may have done something,but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keepinga journal.""""I have sometimes thought,"" said Catherine, doubtingly, ""whether ladiesdo write so much better letters than gentlemen! That is--I should notthink the superiority was always on our side.""""As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that theusual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in threeparticulars.""""And what are they?""""A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and avery frequent ignorance of grammar.""""Upon my word! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming thecompliment. You do not think too highly of us in that way.""""I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write betterletters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw betterlandscapes. In every power, of which taste is the foundation, excellenceis pretty fairly divided between the sexes.""They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen: ""My dear Catherine,"" said she, ""dotake this pin out of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already;I shall be quite sorry if it has, for this is a favourite gown, thoughit cost but nine shillings a yard.""""That is exactly what I should have guessed it, madam,"" said Mr. Tilney,looking at the muslin.""Do you understand muslins, sir?""""Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats, and am allowed to be anexcellent judge; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of agown. I bought one for her the other day, and it was pronounced to be aprodigious bargain by every lady who saw it. I gave but five shillings ayard for it, and a true Indian muslin.""Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius. ""Men commonly take so littlenotice of those things,"" said she; ""I can never get Mr. Allen to knowone of my gowns from another. You must be a great comfort to yoursister, sir.""""I hope I am, madam.""""And pray, sir, what do you think of Miss Morland's gown?""""It is very pretty, madam,"" said he, gravely examining it; ""but I do notthink it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray.""""How can you,"" said Catherine, laughing, ""be so--"" She had almost said""strange.""""I am quite of your opinion, sir,"" replied Mrs. Allen; ""and so I toldMiss Morland when she bought it.""""But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to some account or other;Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief, or a cap, ora cloak. Muslin can never be said to be wasted. I have heard my sistersay so forty times, when she has been extravagant in buying more thanshe wanted, or careless in cutting it to pieces.""""Bath is a charming place, sir; there are so many good shops here. Weare sadly off in the country; not but what we have very good shops inSalisbury, but it is so far to go--eight miles is a long way; Mr. Allensays it is nine, measured nine; but I am sure it cannot be more thaneight; and it is such a fag--I come back tired to death. Now, here onecan step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes.""Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said; andshe kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced.Catherine feared, as she listened to their discourse, that he indulgedhimself a little too much with the foibles of others. ""What are youthinking of so earnestly?"" said he, as they walked back to the ballroom;""not of your partner, I hope, for, by that shake of the head, yourmeditations are not satisfactory.""Catherine coloured, and said, ""I was not thinking of anything.""""That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at oncethat you will not tell me.""""Well then, I will not.""""Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as I am authorized totease you on this subject whenever we meet, and nothing in the worldadvances intimacy so much.""They danced again; and, when the assembly closed, parted, on thelady's side at least, with a strong inclination for continuing theacquaintance. Whether she thought of him so much, while she drank herwarm wine and water, and prepared herself for bed, as to dream of himwhen there, cannot be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than ina slight slumber, or a morning doze at most; for if it be true, as acelebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justifiedin falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared,* it must bevery improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before thegentleman is first known to have dreamt of her. How proper Mr. Tilneymight be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen'shead, but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance forhis young charge he was on inquiry satisfied; for he had early in theevening taken pains to know who her partner was, and had been assuredof Mr. Tilney's being a clergyman, and of a very respectable family inGloucestershire."
Northanger Abbey,4,"CHAPTER 4With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump-room thenext day, secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before themorning were over, and ready to meet him with a smile; but no smilewas demanded--Mr. Tilney did not appear. Every creature in Bath,except himself, was to be seen in the room at different periods of thefashionable hours; crowds of people were every moment passing in andout, up the steps and down; people whom nobody cared about, and nobodywanted to see; and he only was absent. ""What a delightful place Bathis,"" said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock, afterparading the room till they were tired; ""and how pleasant it would be ifwe had any acquaintance here.""This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had noparticular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now;but we are told to ""despair of nothing we would attain,"" as ""unwearieddiligence our point would gain""; and the unwearied diligence with whichshe had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have itsjust reward, for hardly had she been seated ten minutes before a lady ofabout her own age, who was sitting by her, and had been looking at herattentively for several minutes, addressed her with great complaisancein these words: ""I think, madam, I cannot be mistaken; it is a long timesince I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your name Allen?""This question answered, as it readily was, the stranger pronounced hersto be Thorpe; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features ofa former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once sincetheir respective marriages, and that many years ago. Their joy on thismeeting was very great, as well it might, since they had been contentedto know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years. Complimentson good looks now passed; and, after observing how time had slipped awaysince they were last together, how little they had thought of meeting inBath, and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend, they proceeded tomake inquiries and give intelligence as to their families, sisters, andcousins, talking both together, far more ready to give than to receiveinformation, and each hearing very little of what the other said. Mrs.Thorpe, however, had one great advantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen,in a family of children; and when she expatiated on the talents of hersons, and the beauty of her daughters, when she related their differentsituations and views--that John was at Oxford, Edward at MerchantTaylors', and William at sea--and all of them more beloved and respectedin their different station than any other three beings ever were, Mrs.Allen had no similar information to give, no similar triumphs to presson the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend, and was forced tosit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions, consolingherself, however, with the discovery, which her keen eye soon made, thatthe lace on Mrs. Thorpe's pelisse was not half so handsome as that onher own.""Here come my dear girls,"" cried Mrs. Thorpe, pointing at threesmart-looking females who, arm in arm, were then moving towards her. ""Mydear Mrs. Allen, I long to introduce them; they will be so delightedto see you: the tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not she a fine youngwoman? The others are very much admired too, but I believe Isabella isthe handsomest.""The Miss Thorpes were introduced; and Miss Morland, who had been for ashort time forgotten, was introduced likewise. The name seemed to strikethem all; and, after speaking to her with great civility, the eldestyoung lady observed aloud to the rest, ""How excessively like her brotherMiss Morland is!""""The very picture of him indeed!"" cried the mother--and ""I should haveknown her anywhere for his sister!"" was repeated by them all, two orthree times over. For a moment Catherine was surprised; but Mrs. Thorpeand her daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintancewith Mr. James Morland, before she remembered that her eldest brotherhad lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his own college, ofthe name of Thorpe; and that he had spent the last week of the Christmasvacation with his family, near London.The whole being explained, many obliging things were said by the MissThorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her; of beingconsidered as already friends, through the friendship of their brothers,etc., which Catherine heard with pleasure, and answered with all thepretty expressions she could command; and, as the first proof of amity,she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe, andtake a turn with her about the room. Catherine was delighted with thisextension of her Bath acquaintance, and almost forgot Mr. Tilney whileshe talked to Miss Thorpe. Friendship is certainly the finest balm forthe pangs of disappointed love.Their conversation turned upon those subjects, of which the freediscussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacybetween two young ladies: such as dress, balls, flirtations, andquizzes. Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss Morland,and at least four years better informed, had a very decided advantage indiscussing such points; she could compare the balls of Bath with thoseof Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London; could rectifythe opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful attire;could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who onlysmiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of acrowd. These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom theywere entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired mighthave been too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of MissThorpe's manners, and her frequent expressions of delight on thisacquaintance with her, softened down every feeling of awe, and leftnothing but tender affection. Their increasing attachment was not to besatisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room, but required, whenthey all quitted it together, that Miss Thorpe should accompany MissMorland to the very door of Mr. Allen's house; and that they shouldthere part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands, afterlearning, to their mutual relief, that they should see each other acrossthe theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same chapel the nextmorning. Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe'sprogress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired thegraceful spirit of her walk, the fashionable air of her figure anddress; and felt grateful, as well she might, for the chance which hadprocured her such a friend.Mrs. Thorpe was a widow, and not a very rich one; she was agood-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very indulgent mother. Hereldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the younger ones, bypretending to be as handsome as their sister, imitating her air, anddressing in the same style, did very well.This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessityof a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of her pastadventures and sufferings, which might otherwise be expected to occupythe three or four following chapters; in which the worthlessness oflords and attorneys might be set forth, and conversations, which hadpassed twenty years before, be minutely repeated."
Northanger Abbey,5,"CHAPTER 5Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening, inreturning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe, though they certainlyclaimed much of her leisure, as to forget to look with an inquiring eyefor Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye could reach; but she looked invain. Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room. She hopedto be more fortunate the next day; and when her wishes for fine weatherwere answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she hardly felt a doubt ofit; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants,and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and telltheir acquaintance what a charming day it is.As soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerlyjoined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room todiscover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was nota genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sundaythroughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to breathethe fresh air of better company. Here Catherine and Isabella, armin arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreservedconversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but againwas Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner. He wasnowhere to be met with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful,in morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor LowerRooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor among thewalkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the morning. His namewas not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do no more. He mustbe gone from Bath. Yet he had not mentioned that his stay would be soshort! This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in ahero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine's imagination around his personand manners, and increased her anxiety to know more of him. From theThorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bathbefore they met with Mrs. Allen. It was a subject, however, in whichshe often indulged with her fair friend, from whom she received everypossible encouragement to continue to think of him; and his impressionon her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken. Isabella was verysure that he must be a charming young man, and was equally sure that hemust have been delighted with her dear Catherine, and would thereforeshortly return. She liked him the better for being a clergyman, ""for shemust confess herself very partial to the profession""; and something likea sigh escaped her as she said it. Perhaps Catherine was wrong in notdemanding the cause of that gentle emotion--but she was not experiencedenough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know whendelicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence shouldbe forced.Mrs. Allen was now quite happy--quite satisfied with Bath. She had foundsome acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in them the familyof a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune, hadfound these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself. Herdaily expressions were no longer, ""I wish we had some acquaintance inBath!"" They were changed into, ""How glad I am we have met with Mrs.Thorpe!"" and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the twofamilies, as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be; neversatisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side ofMrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there wasscarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance ofsubject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allenof her gowns.The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quickas its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through everygradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proofof it to be given to their friends or themselves. They called each otherby their Christian name, were always arm in arm when they walked, pinnedup each other's train for the dance, and were not to be divided in theset; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments, theywere still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt, and shutthemselves up, to read novels together. Yes, novels; for I will notadopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers,of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to thenumber of which they are themselves adding--joining with their greatestenemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcelyever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if sheaccidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pageswith disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by theheroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? Icannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse sucheffusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk inthreadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let usnot desert one another; we are an injured body. Although our productionshave afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of anyother literary corporation in the world, no species of composition hasbeen so much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foesare almost as many as our readers. And while the abilities of thenine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man whocollects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, andPrior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne,are eulogized by a thousand pens--there seems almost a general wish ofdecrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, andof slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste torecommend them. ""I am no novel-reader--I seldom look into novels--Do notimagine that I often read novels--It is really very well for a novel.""Such is the common cant. ""And what are you reading, Miss--?"" ""Oh! It isonly a novel!"" replies the young lady, while she lays down her bookwith affected indifference, or momentary shame. ""It is only Cecilia, orCamilla, or Belinda""; or, in short, only some work in which the greatestpowers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledgeof human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, theliveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in thebest-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged with avolume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would shehave produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must beagainst her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication,of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person oftaste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statementof improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics ofconversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language,too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the agethat could endure it."
Northanger Abbey,6,"CHAPTER 6The following conversation, which took place between the two friends inthe pump-room one morning, after an acquaintance of eight or ninedays, is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment, and of thedelicacy, discretion, originality of thought, and literary taste whichmarked the reasonableness of that attachment.They met by appointment; and as Isabella had arrived nearly fiveminutes before her friend, her first address naturally was, ""My dearestcreature, what can have made you so late? I have been waiting for you atleast this age!""""Have you, indeed! I am very sorry for it; but really I thought I was invery good time. It is but just one. I hope you have not been here long?""""Oh! These ten ages at least. I am sure I have been here this half hour.But now, let us go and sit down at the other end of the room, and enjoyourselves. I have an hundred things to say to you. In the first place,I was so afraid it would rain this morning, just as I wanted to set off;it looked very showery, and that would have thrown me into agonies! Doyou know, I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine, in a shop window inMilsom Street just now--very like yours, only with coquelicot ribbonsinstead of green; I quite longed for it. But, my dearest Catherine, whathave you been doing with yourself all this morning? Have you gone onwith Udolpho?""""Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and I am got to theblack veil.""""Are you, indeed? How delightful! Oh! I would not tell you what isbehind the black veil for the world! Are not you wild to know?""""Oh! Yes, quite; what can it be? But do not tell me--I would not betold upon any account. I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it isLaurentina's skeleton. Oh! I am delighted with the book! I should liketo spend my whole life in reading it. I assure you, if it had not beento meet you, I would not have come away from it for all the world.""""Dear creature! How much I am obliged to you; and when you have finishedUdolpho, we will read the Italian together; and I have made out a listof ten or twelve more of the same kind for you.""""Have you, indeed! How glad I am! What are they all?""""I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my pocketbook.Castle of Wolfenbach, Clermont, Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of theBlack Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries.Those will last us some time.""""Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you sure they are allhorrid?""""Yes, quite sure; for a particular friend of mine, a Miss Andrews, asweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures in the world, has read everyone of them. I wish you knew Miss Andrews, you would be delighted withher. She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive. I thinkher as beautiful as an angel, and I am so vexed with the men for notadmiring her! I scold them all amazingly about it.""""Scold them! Do you scold them for not admiring her?""""Yes, that I do. There is nothing I would not do for those who arereally my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves; it isnot my nature. My attachments are always excessively strong. I toldCaptain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was totease me all night, I would not dance with him, unless he would allowMiss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel. The men think us incapableof real friendship, you know, and I am determined to show them thedifference. Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, Ishould fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for you arejust the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men.""""Oh, dear!"" cried Catherine, colouring. ""How can you say so?""""I know you very well; you have so much animation, which is exactlywhat Miss Andrews wants, for I must confess there is something amazinglyinsipid about her. Oh! I must tell you, that just after we partedyesterday, I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly--I am sure heis in love with you."" Catherine coloured, and disclaimed again. Isabellalaughed. ""It is very true, upon my honour, but I see how it is; you areindifferent to everybody's admiration, except that of one gentleman,who shall be nameless. Nay, I cannot blame you""--speaking moreseriously--""your feelings are easily understood. Where the heart isreally attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with theattention of anybody else. Everything is so insipid, so uninteresting,that does not relate to the beloved object! I can perfectly comprehendyour feelings.""""But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr.Tilney, for perhaps I may never see him again.""""Not see him again! My dearest creature, do not talk of it. I am sureyou would be miserable if you thought so!""""No, indeed, I should not. I do not pretend to say that I was not verymuch pleased with him; but while I have Udolpho to read, I feel as ifnobody could make me miserable. Oh! The dreadful black veil! My dearIsabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina's skeleton behind it.""""It is so odd to me, that you should never have read Udolpho before; butI suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels.""""No, she does not. She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself;but new books do not fall in our way.""""Sir Charles Grandison! That is an amazing horrid book, is it not? Iremember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume.""""It is not like Udolpho at all; but yet I think it is veryentertaining.""""Do you indeed! You surprise me; I thought it had not been readable.But, my dearest Catherine, have you settled what to wear on your headtonight? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you.The men take notice of that sometimes, you know.""""But it does not signify if they do,"" said Catherine, very innocently.""Signify! Oh, heavens! I make it a rule never to mind what they say.They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them withspirit, and make them keep their distance.""""Are they? Well, I never observed that. They always behave very well tome.""""Oh! They give themselves such airs. They are the most conceitedcreatures in the world, and think themselves of so much importance!By the by, though I have thought of it a hundred times, I have alwaysforgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man. Do youlike them best dark or fair?""""I hardly know. I never much thought about it. Something between both, Ithink. Brown--not fair, and--and not very dark.""""Very well, Catherine. That is exactly he. I have not forgot yourdescription of Mr. Tilney--'a brown skin, with dark eyes, and ratherdark hair.' Well, my taste is different. I prefer light eyes, and as tocomplexion--do you know--I like a sallow better than any other. You mustnot betray me, if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintanceanswering that description.""""Betray you! What do you mean?""""Nay, do not distress me. I believe I have said too much. Let us dropthe subject.""Catherine, in some amazement, complied, and after remaining a fewmoments silent, was on the point of reverting to what interested herat that time rather more than anything else in the world, Laurentina'sskeleton, when her friend prevented her, by saying, ""For heaven's sake!Let us move away from this end of the room. Do you know, there are twoodious young men who have been staring at me this half hour. They reallyput me quite out of countenance. Let us go and look at the arrivals.They will hardly follow us there.""Away they walked to the book; and while Isabella examined the names, itwas Catherine's employment to watch the proceedings of these alarmingyoung men.""They are not coming this way, are they? I hope they are not soimpertinent as to follow us. Pray let me know if they are coming. I amdetermined I will not look up.""In a few moments Catherine, with unaffected pleasure, assured herthat she need not be longer uneasy, as the gentlemen had just left thepump-room.""And which way are they gone?"" said Isabella, turning hastily round.""One was a very good-looking young man.""""They went towards the church-yard.""""Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them! And now, what say youto going to Edgar's Buildings with me, and looking at my new hat? Yousaid you should like to see it.""Catherine readily agreed. ""Only,"" she added, ""perhaps we may overtakethe two young men.""""Oh! Never mind that. If we make haste, we shall pass by them presently,and I am dying to show you my hat.""""But if we only wait a few minutes, there will be no danger of ourseeing them at all.""""I shall not pay them any such compliment, I assure you. I have nonotion of treating men with such respect. That is the way to spoilthem.""Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning; and therefore,to show the independence of Miss Thorpe, and her resolution of humblingthe sex, they set off immediately as fast as they could walk, in pursuitof the two young men."
Northanger Abbey,7,"CHAPTER 7Half a minute conducted them through the pump-yard to the archway,opposite Union Passage; but here they were stopped. Everybody acquaintedwith Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street atthis point; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature, sounfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads, and theprincipal inn of the city, that a day never passes in which parties ofladies, however important their business, whether in quest of pastry,millinery, or even (as in the present case) of young men, are notdetained on one side or other by carriages, horsemen, or carts. Thisevil had been felt and lamented, at least three times a day, by Isabellasince her residence in Bath; and she was now fated to feel and lament itonce more, for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage,and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through thecrowds, and threading the gutters of that interesting alley, theywere prevented crossing by the approach of a gig, driven along on badpavement by a most knowing-looking coachman with all the vehemence thatcould most fitly endanger the lives of himself, his companion, and hishorse.""Oh, these odious gigs!"" said Isabella, looking up. ""How I detest them.""But this detestation, though so just, was of short duration, for shelooked again and exclaimed, ""Delightful! Mr. Morland and my brother!""""Good heaven! 'Tis James!"" was uttered at the same moment by Catherine;and, on catching the young men's eyes, the horse was immediately checkedwith a violence which almost threw him on his haunches, and the servanthaving now scampered up, the gentlemen jumped out, and the equipage wasdelivered to his care.Catherine, by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected, received herbrother with the liveliest pleasure; and he, being of a very amiabledisposition, and sincerely attached to her, gave every proof on hisside of equal satisfaction, which he could have leisure to do, while thebright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice;and to her his devoirs were speedily paid, with a mixture of joy andembarrassment which might have informed Catherine, had she been moreexpert in the development of other people's feelings, and less simplyengrossed by her own, that her brother thought her friend quite aspretty as she could do herself.John Thorpe, who in the meantime had been giving orders about thehorses, soon joined them, and from him she directly received the amendswhich were her due; for while he slightly and carelessly touched thehand of Isabella, on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a shortbow. He was a stout young man of middling height, who, with a plain faceand ungraceful form, seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he worethe dress of a groom, and too much like a gentleman unless he were easywhere he ought to be civil, and impudent where he might be allowed to beeasy. He took out his watch: ""How long do you think we have been runningit from Tetbury, Miss Morland?""""I do not know the distance."" Her brother told her that it wastwenty-three miles.""Three and twenty!"" cried Thorpe. ""Five and twenty if it is an inch.""Morland remonstrated, pleaded the authority of road-books, innkeepers,and milestones; but his friend disregarded them all; he had a surer testof distance. ""I know it must be five and twenty,"" said he, ""by the timewe have been doing it. It is now half after one; we drove out of theinn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any manin England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness;that makes it exactly twenty-five.""""You have lost an hour,"" said Morland; ""it was only ten o'clock when wecame from Tetbury.""""Ten o'clock! It was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every stroke. Thisbrother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; dobut look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed inyour life?"" (The servant had just mounted the carriage and was drivingoff.) ""Such true blood! Three hours and and a half indeed coming onlythree and twenty miles! Look at that creature, and suppose it possibleif you can.""""He does look very hot, to be sure.""""Hot! He had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but lookat his forehand; look at his loins; only see how he moves; that horsecannot go less than ten miles an hour: tie his legs and he will get on.What do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is not it?Well hung; town-built; I have not had it a month. It was built for aChristchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he ranit a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with it.I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind,though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I chanced tomeet him on Magdalen Bridge, as he was driving into Oxford, last term:'Ah! Thorpe,' said he, 'do you happen to want such a little thing asthis? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired of it.''Oh! D--,' said I; 'I am your man; what do you ask?' And how much do youthink he did, Miss Morland?""""I am sure I cannot guess at all.""""Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board,lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as goodas new, or better. He asked fifty guineas; I closed with him directly,threw down the money, and the carriage was mine.""""And I am sure,"" said Catherine, ""I know so little of such things that Icannot judge whether it was cheap or dear.""""Neither one nor t'other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; butI hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash.""""That was very good-natured of you,"" said Catherine, quite pleased.""Oh! D---- it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend,I hate to be pitiful.""An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the youngladies; and, on finding whither they were going, it was decided thatthe gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar's Buildings, and pay theirrespects to Mrs. Thorpe. James and Isabella led the way; and sowell satisfied was the latter with her lot, so contentedly was sheendeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the doublerecommendation of being her brother's friend, and her friend's brother,so pure and uncoquettish were her feelings, that, though they overtookand passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street, she was so farfrom seeking to attract their notice, that she looked back at them onlythree times.John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and, after a few minutes'silence, renewed the conversation about his gig. ""You will find,however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by somepeople, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day;Jackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at thetime.""""Yes,"" said Morland, who overheard this; ""but you forget that your horsewas included.""""My horse! Oh, d---- it! I would not sell my horse for a hundred. Areyou fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?""""Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one; but I amparticularly fond of it.""""I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day.""""Thank you,"" said Catherine, in some distress, from a doubt of thepropriety of accepting such an offer.""I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow.""""Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?""""Rest! He has only come three and twenty miles today; all nonsense;nothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them up so soon.No, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every daywhile I am here.""""Shall you indeed!"" said Catherine very seriously. ""That will be fortymiles a day.""""Forty! Aye, fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive you up Lansdowntomorrow; mind, I am engaged.""""How delightful that will be!"" cried Isabella, turning round. ""Mydearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother, you willnot have room for a third.""""A third indeed! No, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my sistersabout; that would be a good joke, faith! Morland must take care of you.""This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two; butCatherine heard neither the particulars nor the result. Her companion'sdiscourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more thana short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of everywoman they met; and Catherine, after listening and agreeing as long asshe could, with all the civility and deference of the youthful femalemind, fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to thatof a self-assured man, especially where the beauty of her own sex isconcerned, ventured at length to vary the subject by a question whichhad been long uppermost in her thoughts; it was, ""Have you ever readUdolpho, Mr. Thorpe?""""Udolpho! Oh, Lord! Not I; I never read novels; I have something else todo.""Catherine, humbled and ashamed, was going to apologize for her question,but he prevented her by saying, ""Novels are all so full of nonsenseand stuff; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out sinceTom Jones, except The Monk; I read that t'other day; but as for all theothers, they are the stupidest things in creation.""""I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read it; it is so veryinteresting.""""Not I, faith! No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe's; hernovels are amusing enough; they are worth reading; some fun and naturein them.""""Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe,"" said Catherine, with somehesitation, from the fear of mortifying him.""No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of thatother stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about,she who married the French emigrant.""""I suppose you mean Camilla?""""Yes, that's the book; such unnatural stuff! An old man playing atsee-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soonfound it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must bebefore I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant, I wassure I should never be able to get through it.""""I have never read it.""""You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you canimagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man's playing atsee-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not.""This critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poorCatherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe's lodgings, and thefeelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave wayto the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs.Thorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage. ""Ah, Mother!How do you do?"" said he, giving her a hearty shake of the hand. ""Wheredid you get that quiz of a hat? It makes you look like an old witch.Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must lookout for a couple of good beds somewhere near."" And this address seemedto satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother's heart, for shereceived him with the most delighted and exulting affection. On histwo younger sisters he then bestowed an equal portion of his fraternaltenderness, for he asked each of them how they did, and observed thatthey both looked very ugly.These manners did not please Catherine; but he was James's friendand Isabella's brother; and her judgment was further bought off byIsabella's assuring her, when they withdrew to see the new hat, thatJohn thought her the most charming girl in the world, and by John'sengaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening. Had shebeen older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, whereyouth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness ofreason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girlin the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and theconsequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour withthe Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen's, and James, asthe door was closed on them, said, ""Well, Catherine, how do you like myfriend Thorpe?"" instead of answering, as she probably would have done,had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, ""I do not likehim at all,"" she directly replied, ""I like him very much; he seems veryagreeable.""""He is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; butthat will recommend him to your sex, I believe: and how do you like therest of the family?""""Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly.""""I am very glad to hear you say so; she is just the kind of young womanI could wish to see you attached to; she has so much good sense, and isso thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her;and she seems very fond of you. She said the highest things in yourpraise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as MissThorpe even you, Catherine,"" taking her hand with affection, ""may beproud of.""""Indeed I am,"" she replied; ""I love her exceedingly, and am delightedto find that you like her too. You hardly mentioned anything of her whenyou wrote to me after your visit there.""""Because I thought I should soon see you myself. I hope you will be agreat deal together while you are in Bath. She is a most amiable girl;such a superior understanding! How fond all the family are of her; sheis evidently the general favourite; and how much she must be admired insuch a place as this--is not she?""""Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girlin Bath.""""I dare say he does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge ofbeauty than Mr. Allen. I need not ask you whether you are happy here, mydear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe, itwould be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am sure,are very kind to you?""""Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come itwill be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so faron purpose to see me.""James accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his consciencefor accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, ""Indeed,Catherine, I love you dearly.""Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, thesituation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters nowpassed between them, and continued, with only one small digressionon James's part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached PulteneyStreet, where he was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen,invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the latterto guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet.A pre-engagement in Edgar's Buildings prevented his accepting theinvitation of one friend, and obliged him to hurry away as soon as hehad satisfied the demands of the other. The time of the two partiesuniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted, Catherine was thenleft to the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened imaginationover the pages of Udolpho, lost from all worldly concerns of dressingand dinner, incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen's fears on the delay of anexpected dressmaker, and having only one minute in sixty to bestow evenon the reflection of her own felicity, in being already engaged for theevening."
Northanger Abbey,8,"CHAPTER 8In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker, however, the party from PulteneyStreet reached the Upper Rooms in very good time. The Thorpes and JamesMorland were there only two minutes before them; and Isabella havinggone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her friend with the mostsmiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of her gown, andenvying the curl of her hair, they followed their chaperones, arm inarm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thoughtoccurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the handor a smile of affection.The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated; andJames, who had been engaged quite as long as his sister, was veryimportunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into thecard-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she declared, should induceher to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too. ""Iassure you,"" said she, ""I would not stand up without your dear sisterfor all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated thewhole evening."" Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, andthey continued as they were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, whohad been talking to James on the other side of her, turned again to hissister and whispered, ""My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you,your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will notmind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment,and then you may easily find me out."" Catherine, though a littledisappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and theothers rising up, Isabella had only time to press her friend's hand andsay, ""Good-bye, my dear love,"" before they hurried off. The youngerMiss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs.Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now remained. She could not helpbeing vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she not only longedto be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of hersituation could not be known, she was sharing with the scores of otheryoung ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner.To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance ofinfamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and themisconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of thosecircumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and herfortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character. Catherinehad fortitude too; she suffered, but no murmur passed her lips.From this state of humiliation, she was roused, at the end of tenminutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr.Tilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he seemed to bemoving that way, but he did not see her, and therefore the smile and theblush, which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed awaywithout sullying her heroic importance. He looked as handsome and aslively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable andpleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his arm, and whom Catherineimmediately guessed to be his sister; thus unthinkingly throwing awaya fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever, by beingmarried already. But guided only by what was simple and probable, ithad never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he had notbehaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had beenused; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister.From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister'snow being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlikepaleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen's bosom, Catherine saterect, in the perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a littleredder than usual.Mr. Tilney and his companion, who continued, though slowly, to approach,were immediately preceded by a lady, an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe; andthis lady stopping to speak to her, they, as belonging to her, stoppedlikewise, and Catherine, catching Mr. Tilney's eye, instantly receivedfrom him the smiling tribute of recognition. She returned it withpleasure, and then advancing still nearer, he spoke both to her and Mrs.Allen, by whom he was very civilly acknowledged. ""I am very happy to seeyou again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had left Bath."" He thanked herfor her fears, and said that he had quitted it for a week, on the verymorning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her.""Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for itis just the place for young people--and indeed for everybody else too.I tell Mr. Allen, when he talks of being sick of it, that I am sure heshould not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it ismuch better to be here than at home at this dull time of year. I tellhim he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health.""""And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place,from finding it of service to him.""""Thank you, sir. I have no doubt that he will. A neighbour of ours,Dr. Skinner, was here for his health last winter, and came away quitestout.""""That circumstance must give great encouragement.""""Yes, sir--and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months; so Itell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away.""Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen,that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilneywith seats, as they had agreed to join their party. This was accordinglydone, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and after afew minutes' consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with him. Thiscompliment, delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to thelady; and in giving her denial, she expressed her sorrow on the occasionso very much as if she really felt it that had Thorpe, who joined herjust afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he might have thought hersufferings rather too acute. The very easy manner in which he then toldher that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her moreto her lot; nor did the particulars which he entered into while theywere standing up, of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had justleft, and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them, interest herso much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of theroom where she had left Mr. Tilney. Of her dear Isabella, to whom sheparticularly longed to point out that gentleman, she could see nothing.They were in different sets. She was separated from all her party, andaway from all her acquaintance; one mortification succeeded another,and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson, that to go previouslyengaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity orenjoyment of a young lady. From such a moralizing strain as this, shewas suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round,perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney anda gentleman. ""I beg your pardon, Miss Morland,"" said she, ""for thisliberty--but I cannot anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe saidshe was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in thisyoung lady by you."" Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creaturein the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine. The young ladieswere introduced to each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense ofsuch goodness, Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mindmaking light of the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with havingso respectably settled her young charge, returned to her party.Miss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeablecountenance; and her air, though it had not all the decided pretension,the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe's, had more real elegance. Hermanners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy noraffectedly open; and she seemed capable of being young, attractive, andat a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her,and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivablevexation on every little trifling occurrence. Catherine, interested atonce by her appearance and her relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirousof being acquainted with her, and readily talked therefore whenever shecould think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for sayingit. But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, bythe frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented theirdoing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance, byinforming themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she admiredits buildings and surrounding country, whether she drew, or played, orsang, and whether she was fond of riding on horseback.The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her armgently seized by her faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed,""At last I have got you. My dearest creature, I have been looking foryou this hour. What could induce you to come into this set, when youknew I was in the other? I have been quite wretched without you.""""My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at you? I could noteven see where you were.""""So I told your brother all the time--but he would not believe me. Do goand see for her, Mr. Morland, said I--but all in vain--he would not stiran inch. Was not it so, Mr. Morland? But you men are all so immoderatelylazy! I have been scolding him to such a degree, my dear Catherine, youwould be quite amazed. You know I never stand upon ceremony with suchpeople.""""Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head,"" whisperedCatherine, detaching her friend from James. ""It is Mr. Tilney's sister.""""Oh! Heavens! You don't say so! Let me look at her this moment. What adelightful girl! I never saw anything half so beautiful! But where isher all-conquering brother? Is he in the room? Point him out to me thisinstant, if he is. I die to see him. Mr. Morland, you are not to listen.We are not talking about you.""""But what is all this whispering about? What is going on?""""There now, I knew how it would be. You men have such restlesscuriosity! Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed! 'Tis nothing. But besatisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter.""""And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?""""Well, I declare I never knew anything like you. What can it signify toyou, what we are talking of. Perhaps we are talking about you; thereforeI would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear somethingnot very agreeable.""In this commonplace chatter, which lasted some time, the originalsubject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine was very wellpleased to have it dropped for a while, she could not avoid a littlesuspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella's impatient desire tosee Mr. Tilney. When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James wouldhave led his fair partner away, but she resisted. ""I tell you, Mr.Morland,"" she cried, ""I would not do such a thing for all the world.How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what yourbrother wants me to do. He wants me to dance with him again, thoughI tell him that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against therules. It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to changepartners.""""Upon my honour,"" said James, ""in these public assemblies, it is asoften done as not.""""Nonsense, how can you say so? But when you men have a point to carry,you never stick at anything. My sweet Catherine, do support me; persuadeyour brother how impossible it is. Tell him that it would quite shockyou to see me do such a thing; now would not it?""""No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better change.""""There,"" cried Isabella, ""you hear what your sister says, and yet youwill not mind her. Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set allthe old ladies in Bath in a bustle. Come along, my dearest Catherine,for heaven's sake, and stand by me."" And off they went, to regaintheir former place. John Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked away; andCatherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeatingthe agreeable request which had already flattered her once, made herway to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she could, in the hopeof finding him still with them--a hope which, when it proved to befruitless, she felt to have been highly unreasonable. ""Well, my dear,""said Mrs. Thorpe, impatient for praise of her son, ""I hope you have hadan agreeable partner.""""Very agreeable, madam.""""I am glad of it. John has charming spirits, has not he?""""Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?"" said Mrs. Allen.""No, where is he?""""He was with us just now, and said he was so tired of lounging about,that he was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps he would askyou, if he met with you.""""Where can he be?"" said Catherine, looking round; but she had not lookedround long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance.""Ah! He has got a partner; I wish he had asked you,"" said Mrs. Allen;and after a short silence, she added, ""he is a very agreeable youngman.""""Indeed he is, Mrs. Allen,"" said Mrs. Thorpe, smiling complacently; ""Imust say it, though I am his mother, that there is not a more agreeableyoung man in the world.""This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehensionof many; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen, for after only a moment'sconsideration, she said, in a whisper to Catherine, ""I dare say shethought I was speaking of her son.""Catherine was disappointed and vexed. She seemed to have missed by solittle the very object she had had in view; and this persuasion did notincline her to a very gracious reply, when John Thorpe came up to hersoon afterwards and said, ""Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I areto stand up and jig it together again.""""Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and,besides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more.""""Do not you? Then let us walk about and quiz people. Come along withme, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my twoyounger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them thishalf hour.""Again Catherine excused herself; and at last he walked off to quiz hissisters by himself. The rest of the evening she found very dull; Mr.Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea, to attend that of hispartner; Miss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near her, andJames and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that thelatter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile, onesqueeze, and one ""dearest Catherine."""
Northanger Abbey,9,"CHAPTER 9The progress of Catherine's unhappiness from the events of the eveningwas as follows. It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction witheverybody about her, while she remained in the rooms, which speedilybrought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home. This,on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction of extraordinaryhunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an earnest longing tobe in bed; such was the extreme point of her distress; for when thereshe immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours, andfrom which she awoke perfectly revived, in excellent spirits, with freshhopes and fresh schemes. The first wish of her heart was to improve heracquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost her first resolution, to seekher for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon. In the pump-room, oneso newly arrived in Bath must be met with, and that building she hadalready found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence,and the completion of female intimacy, so admirably adapted for secretdiscourses and unlimited confidence, that she was most reasonablyencouraged to expect another friend from within its walls. Her planfor the morning thus settled, she sat quietly down to her book afterbreakfast, resolving to remain in the same place and the same employmenttill the clock struck one; and from habitude very little incommoded bythe remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind andincapacity for thinking were such, that as she never talked a greatdeal, so she could never be entirely silent; and, therefore, while shesat at her work, if she lost her needle or broke her thread, if sheheard a carriage in the street, or saw a speck upon her gown, she mustobserve it aloud, whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her ornot. At about half past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her in hasteto the window, and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of therebeing two open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant,her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe camerunning upstairs, calling out, ""Well, Miss Morland, here I am. Haveyou been waiting long? We could not come before; the old devil of acoachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into,and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are outof the street. How do you do, Mrs. Allen? A famous ball last night, wasnot it? Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a confoundedhurry to be off. They want to get their tumble over.""""What do you mean?"" said Catherine. ""Where are you all going to?""""Going to? Why, you have not forgot our engagement! Did not we agreetogether to take a drive this morning? What a head you have! We aregoing up Claverton Down.""""Something was said about it, I remember,"" said Catherine, looking atMrs. Allen for her opinion; ""but really I did not expect you.""""Not expect me! That's a good one! And what a dust you would have made,if I had not come.""Catherine's silent appeal to her friend, meanwhile, was entirely thrownaway, for Mrs. Allen, not being at all in the habit of conveying anyexpression herself by a look, was not aware of its being ever intendedby anybody else; and Catherine, whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney againcould at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive, and whothought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr. Thorpe, asIsabella was going at the same time with James, was therefore obliged tospeak plainer. ""Well, ma'am, what do you say to it? Can you spare me foran hour or two? Shall I go?""""Do just as you please, my dear,"" replied Mrs. Allen, with the mostplacid indifference. Catherine took the advice, and ran off to getready. In a very few minutes she reappeared, having scarcely allowedthe two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in herpraise, after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen's admiration of his gig;and then receiving her friend's parting good wishes, they both hurrieddownstairs. ""My dearest creature,"" cried Isabella, to whom the dutyof friendship immediately called her before she could get into thecarriage, ""you have been at least three hours getting ready. I wasafraid you were ill. What a delightful ball we had last night. I have athousand things to say to you; but make haste and get in, for I long tobe off.""Catherine followed her orders and turned away, but not too soon to hearher friend exclaim aloud to James, ""What a sweet girl she is! I quitedote on her.""""You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,"" said Thorpe, as he handedher in, ""if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off.He will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the restfor a minute; but he will soon know his master. He is full of spirits,playful as can be, but there is no vice in him.""Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one, but it was toolate to retreat, and she was too young to own herself frightened; so,resigning herself to her fate, and trusting to the animal's boastedknowledge of its owner, she sat peaceably down, and saw Thorpe sit downby her. Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at thehorse's head was bid in an important voice ""to let him go,"" and off theywent in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a caper, oranything like one. Catherine, delighted at so happy an escape, spokeher pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her companion immediatelymade the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirelyowing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held thereins, and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he haddirected his whip. Catherine, though she could not help wondering thatwith such perfect command of his horse, he should think it necessary toalarm her with a relation of its tricks, congratulated herself sincerelyon being under the care of so excellent a coachman; and perceiving thatthe animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner, withoutshowing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity, and(considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour) by no meansalarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air andexercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine mild day of February,with the consciousness of safety. A silence of several minutes succeededtheir first short dialogue; it was broken by Thorpe's saying veryabruptly, ""Old Allen is as rich as a Jew--is not he?"" Catherine did notunderstand him--and he repeated his question, adding in explanation,""Old Allen, the man you are with.""""Oh! Mr. Allen, you mean. Yes, I believe, he is very rich.""""And no children at all?""""No--not any.""""A famous thing for his next heirs. He is your godfather, is not he?""""My godfather! No.""""But you are always very much with them.""""Yes, very much.""""Aye, that is what I meant. He seems a good kind of old fellow enough,and has lived very well in his time, I dare say; he is not gouty fornothing. Does he drink his bottle a day now?""""His bottle a day! No. Why should you think of such a thing? He is avery temperate man, and you could not fancy him in liquor last night?""""Lord help you! You women are always thinking of men's being in liquor.Why, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle? I am sure ofthis--that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day, there would notbe half the disorders in the world there are now. It would be a famousgood thing for us all.""""I cannot believe it.""""Oh! Lord, it would be the saving of thousands. There is not thehundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought tobe. Our foggy climate wants help.""""And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk inOxford.""""Oxford! There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you. Nobody drinksthere. You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pintsat the utmost. Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable thing, atthe last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared about fivepints a head. It was looked upon as something out of the common way.Mine is famous good stuff, to be sure. You would not often meet withanything like it in Oxford--and that may account for it. But this willjust give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there.""""Yes, it does give a notion,"" said Catherine warmly, ""and that is, thatyou all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did. However, Iam sure James does not drink so much.""This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply, of whichno part was very distinct, except the frequent exclamations, amountingalmost to oaths, which adorned it, and Catherine was left, when itended, with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great dealof wine drunk in Oxford, and the same happy conviction of her brother'scomparative sobriety.Thorpe's ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage, andshe was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horsemoved along, and the ease which his paces, as well as the excellence ofthe springs, gave the motion of the carriage. She followed him in allhis admiration as well as she could. To go before or beyond him wasimpossible. His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject, his rapidityof expression, and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power;she could strike out nothing new in commendation, but she readily echoedwhatever he chose to assert, and it was finally settled between themwithout any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the mostcomplete of its kind in England, his carriage the neatest, his horse thebest goer, and himself the best coachman. ""You do not really think,Mr. Thorpe,"" said Catherine, venturing after some time to consider thematter as entirely decided, and to offer some little variation on thesubject, ""that James's gig will break down?""""Break down! Oh! Lord! Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing inyour life? There is not a sound piece of iron about it. The wheels havebeen fairly worn out these ten years at least--and as for the body! Uponmy soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch. It is themost devilish little rickety business I ever beheld! Thank God! wehave got a better. I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fiftythousand pounds.""""Good heavens!"" cried Catherine, quite frightened. ""Then pray let usturn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on. Do letus turn back, Mr. Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell him howvery unsafe it is.""""Unsafe! Oh, lord! What is there in that? They will only get a roll ifit does break down; and there is plenty of dirt; it will be excellentfalling. Oh, curse it! The carriage is safe enough, if a man knows howto drive it; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twentyyears after it is fairly worn out. Lord bless you! I would undertake forfive pounds to drive it to York and back again, without losing a nail.""Catherine listened with astonishment; she knew not how to reconcile twosuch very different accounts of the same thing; for she had not beenbrought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know tohow many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanitywill lead. Her own family were plain, matter-of-fact people who seldomaimed at wit of any kind; her father, at the utmost, being contentedwith a pun, and her mother with a proverb; they were not in the habittherefore of telling lies to increase their importance, or of assertingat one moment what they would contradict the next. She reflected on theaffair for some time in much perplexity, and was more than once on thepoint of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his realopinion on the subject; but she checked herself, because it appeared toher that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights, in makingthose things plain which he had before made ambiguous; and, joining tothis, the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister andhis friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preservethem, she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in factperfectly safe, and therefore would alarm herself no longer. By himthe whole matter seemed entirely forgotten; and all the rest of hisconversation, or rather talk, began and ended with himself and his ownconcerns. He told her of horses which he had bought for a trifle andsold for incredible sums; of racing matches, in which his judgment hadinfallibly foretold the winner; of shooting parties, in which he hadkilled more birds (though without having one good shot) than all hiscompanions together; and described to her some famous day's sport, withthe fox-hounds, in which his foresight and skill in directing the dogshad repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman, and in whichthe boldness of his riding, though it had never endangered his own lifefor a moment, had been constantly leading others into difficulties,which he calmly concluded had broken the necks of many.Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself, and unfixedas were her general notions of what men ought to be, she could notentirely repress a doubt, while she bore with the effusions of hisendless conceit, of his being altogether completely agreeable. It was abold surmise, for he was Isabella's brother; and she had been assured byJames that his manners would recommend him to all her sex; but in spiteof this, the extreme weariness of his company, which crept over herbefore they had been out an hour, and which continued unceasingly toincrease till they stopped in Pulteney Street again, induced her, insome small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust hispowers of giving universal pleasure.When they arrived at Mrs. Allen's door, the astonishment of Isabella washardly to be expressed, on finding that it was too late in the day forthem to attend her friend into the house: ""Past three o'clock!"" It wasinconceivable, incredible, impossible! And she would neither believe herown watch, nor her brother's, nor the servant's; she would believe noassurance of it founded on reason or reality, till Morland produced hiswatch, and ascertained the fact; to have doubted a moment longer thenwould have been equally inconceivable, incredible, and impossible; andshe could only protest, over and over again, that no two hours and ahalf had ever gone off so swiftly before, as Catherine was called on toconfirm; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella;but the latter was spared the misery of her friend's dissenting voice,by not waiting for her answer. Her own feelings entirely engrossedher; her wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to godirectly home. It was ages since she had had a moment's conversationwith her dearest Catherine; and, though she had such thousands of thingsto say to her, it appeared as if they were never to be together again;so, with smiles of most exquisite misery, and the laughing eye of utterdespondency, she bade her friend adieu and went on.Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness ofthe morning, and was immediately greeted with, ""Well, my dear, hereyou are,"" a truth which she had no greater inclination than power todispute; ""and I hope you have had a pleasant airing?""""Yes, ma'am, I thank you; we could not have had a nicer day.""""So Mrs. Thorpe said; she was vastly pleased at your all going.""""You have seen Mrs. Thorpe, then?""""Yes, I went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone, and there I mether, and we had a great deal of talk together. She says there was hardlyany veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly scarce.""""Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance?""""Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs.Hughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her.""""Did you indeed? And did they speak to you?""""Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour. They seemvery agreeable people. Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spottedmuslin, and I fancy, by what I can learn, that she always dresses veryhandsomely. Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family.""""And what did she tell you of them?""""Oh! A vast deal indeed; she hardly talked of anything else.""""Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from?""""Yes, she did; but I cannot recollect now. But they are very good kindof people, and very rich. Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond, and sheand Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond had a very largefortune; and, when she married, her father gave her twenty thousandpounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes. Mrs. Hughes saw all theclothes after they came from the warehouse.""""And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath?""""Yes, I fancy they are, but I am not quite certain. Upon recollection,however, I have a notion they are both dead; at least the mother is;yes, I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead, because Mrs. Hughes told me therewas a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughteron her wedding-day and that Miss Tilney has got now, for they were putby for her when her mother died.""""And is Mr. Tilney, my partner, the only son?""""I cannot be quite positive about that, my dear; I have some idea he is;but, however, he is a very fine young man, Mrs. Hughes says, and likelyto do very well.""Catherine inquired no further; she had heard enough to feel thatMrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give, and that she was mostparticularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting withboth brother and sister. Could she have foreseen such a circumstance,nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others; and, asit was, she could only lament her ill luck, and think over what she hadlost, till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been verypleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable."
Northanger Abbey,10,"CHAPTER 10The Allens, Thorpes, and Morlands all met in the evening at thetheatre; and, as Catherine and Isabella sat together, there was then anopportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousandthings which had been collecting within her for communication in theimmeasurable length of time which had divided them. ""Oh, heavens!My beloved Catherine, have I got you at last?"" was her address onCatherine's entering the box and sitting by her. ""Now, Mr. Morland,"" forhe was close to her on the other side, ""I shall not speak another wordto you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to expect it. Mysweetest Catherine, how have you been this long age? But I need not askyou, for you look delightfully. You really have done your hair in amore heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want toattract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love with youalready; and as for Mr. Tilney--but that is a settled thing--even yourmodesty cannot doubt his attachment now; his coming back to Bath makesit too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see him! I really am quitewild with impatience. My mother says he is the most delightful young manin the world; she saw him this morning, you know; you must introduce himto me. Is he in the house now? Look about, for heaven's sake! I assureyou, I can hardly exist till I see him.""""No,"" said Catherine, ""he is not here; I cannot see him anywhere.""""Oh, horrid! Am I never to be acquainted with him? How do you like mygown? I think it does not look amiss; the sleeves were entirely my ownthought. Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brotherand I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to behere for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. We soon foundout that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country toevery other place; really, our opinions were so exactly the same, it wasquite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we differed; Iwould not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I amsure you would have made some droll remark or other about it.""""No, indeed I should not.""""Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself. Youwould have told us that we seemed born for each other, or some nonsenseof that kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception; mycheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would not have had you byfor the world.""""Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made so improper a remarkupon any account; and besides, I am sure it would never have entered myhead.""Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening toJames.Catherine's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney againcontinued in full force the next morning; and till the usual moment ofgoing to the pump-room, she felt some alarm from the dread of a secondprevention. But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared todelay them, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room,where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr.Allen, after drinking his glass of water, joined some gentlemen totalk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of theirnewspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every newface, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of theThorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd inless than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took herusual place by the side of her friend. James, who was now in constantattendance, maintained a similar position, and separating themselvesfrom the rest of their party, they walked in that manner for sometime, till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which,confining her entirely to her friend and brother, gave her verylittle share in the notice of either. They were always engaged insome sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but their sentiment wasconveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity attended withso much laughter, that though Catherine's supporting opinion was notunfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to giveany, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length howevershe was empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowednecessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw justentering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, witha firmer determination to be acquainted, than she might have had courageto command, had she not been urged by the disappointment of the daybefore. Miss Tilney met her with great civility, returned her advanceswith equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as long asboth parties remained in the room; and though in all probability notan observation was made, nor an expression used by either which had notbeen made and used some thousands of times before, under that roof, inevery Bath season, yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicityand truth, and without personal conceit, might be something uncommon.""How well your brother dances!"" was an artless exclamation ofCatherine's towards the close of their conversation, which at oncesurprised and amused her companion.""Henry!"" she replied with a smile. ""Yes, he does dance very well.""""He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the otherevening, when he saw me sitting down. But I really had been engagedthe whole day to Mr. Thorpe."" Miss Tilney could only bow. ""You cannotthink,"" added Catherine after a moment's silence, ""how surprised I wasto see him again. I felt so sure of his being quite gone away.""""When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, he was in Bath butfor a couple of days. He came only to engage lodgings for us.""""That never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing him anywhere, Ithought he must be gone. Was not the young lady he danced with on Mondaya Miss Smith?""""Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes.""""I dare say she was very glad to dance. Do you think her pretty?""""Not very.""""He never comes to the pump-room, I suppose?""""Yes, sometimes; but he has rid out this morning with my father.""Mrs. Hughes now joined them, and asked Miss Tilney if she was ready togo. ""I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon,"" saidCatherine. ""Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?""""Perhaps we--Yes, I think we certainly shall.""""I am glad of it, for we shall all be there."" This civility was dulyreturned; and they parted--on Miss Tilney's side with some knowledgeof her new acquaintance's feelings, and on Catherine's, without thesmallest consciousness of having explained them.She went home very happy. The morning had answered all her hopes, andthe evening of the following day was now the object of expectation,the future good. What gown and what head-dress she should wear on theoccasion became her chief concern. She cannot be justified in it. Dressis at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude aboutit often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew all this very well; hergreat aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmasbefore; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debatingbetween her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but theshortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening.This would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon,from which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother ratherthan a great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware ofthe insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying tothe feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how littlethe heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire;how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and howunsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged,the mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone.No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better forit. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something ofshabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter. But notone of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine.She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very differentfrom what had attended her thither the Monday before. She had then beenexulting in her engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious toavoid his sight, lest he should engage her again; for though she couldnot, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her a third time todance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less. Everyyoung lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for everyyoung lady has at some time or other known the same agitation. All havebeen, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from thepursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxiousfor the attentions of someone whom they wished to please. As soon asthey were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine's agony began; she fidgetedabout if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as possiblefrom his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him. Thecotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she saw nothingof the Tilneys.""Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine,"" whispered Isabella, ""but I amreally going to dance with your brother again. I declare positively itis quite shocking. I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself, but youand John must keep us in countenance. Make haste, my dear creature, andcome to us. John is just walked off, but he will be back in a moment.""Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer. The others walkedaway, John Thorpe was still in view, and she gave herself up for lost.That she might not appear, however, to observe or expect him, she kepther eyes intently fixed on her fan; and a self-condemnation for herfolly, in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet withthe Tilneys in any reasonable time, had just passed through her mind,when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance,by Mr. Tilney himself. With what sparkling eyes and ready motion shegranted his request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she wentwith him to the set, may be easily imagined. To escape, and, asshe believed, so narrowly escape John Thorpe, and to be asked, soimmediately on his joining her, asked by Mr. Tilney, as if he had soughther on purpose!--it did not appear to her that life could supply anygreater felicity.Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of aplace, however, when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe, who stoodbehind her. ""Heyday, Miss Morland!"" said he. ""What is the meaning ofthis? I thought you and I were to dance together.""""I wonder you should think so, for you never asked me.""""That is a good one, by Jove! I asked you as soon as I came into theroom, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round,you were gone! This is a cursed shabby trick! I only came for the sakeof dancing with you, and I firmly believe you were engaged to me eversince Monday. Yes; I remember, I asked you while you were waiting in thelobby for your cloak. And here have I been telling all my acquaintancethat I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room; andwhen they see you standing up with somebody else, they will quiz mefamously.""""Oh, no; they will never think of me, after such a description as that.""""By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of the room forblockheads. What chap have you there?"" Catherine satisfied hiscuriosity. ""Tilney,"" he repeated. ""Hum--I do not know him. A good figureof a man; well put together. Does he want a horse? Here is a friendof mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody. Afamous clever animal for the road--only forty guineas. I had fifty mindsto buy it myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horsewhen I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would notdo for the field. I would give any money for a real good hunter. Ihave three now, the best that ever were backed. I would not takeeight hundred guineas for them. Fletcher and I mean to get a house inLeicestershire, against the next season. It is so d--uncomfortable,living at an inn.""This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine'sattention, for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure ofa long string of passing ladies. Her partner now drew near, and said,""That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had he stayed withyou half a minute longer. He has no business to withdraw the attentionof my partner from me. We have entered into a contract of mutualagreeableness for the space of an evening, and all our agreeablenessbelongs solely to each other for that time. Nobody can fasten themselveson the notice of one, without injuring the rights of the other.I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage. Fidelity andcomplaisance are the principal duties of both; and those men who do notchoose to dance or marry themselves, have no business with the partnersor wives of their neighbours.""""But they are such very different things!""""--That you think they cannot be compared together.""""To be sure not. People that marry can never part, but must go and keephouse together. People that dance only stand opposite each other in along room for half an hour.""""And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing. Taken in thatlight certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I couldplace them in such a view. You will allow, that in both, man has theadvantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both,it is an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage ofeach; and that when once entered into, they belong exclusively to eachother till the moment of its dissolution; that it is their duty, eachto endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she hadbestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep their ownimaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours,or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else. Youwill allow all this?""""Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very well; but stillthey are so very different. I cannot look upon them at all in the samelight, nor think the same duties belong to them.""""In one respect, there certainly is a difference. In marriage, the manis supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to makethe home agreeable to the man; he is to purvey, and she is to smile.But in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness, thecompliance are expected from him, while she furnishes the fan and thelavender water. That, I suppose, was the difference of duties whichstruck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison.""""No, indeed, I never thought of that.""""Then I am quite at a loss. One thing, however, I must observe. Thisdisposition on your side is rather alarming. You totally disallow anysimilarity in the obligations; and may I not thence infer that yournotions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as yourpartner might wish? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman whospoke to you just now were to return, or if any other gentleman were toaddress you, there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing withhim as long as you chose?""""Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother's, that if hetalks to me, I must talk to him again; but there are hardly three youngmen in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with.""""And is that to be my only security? Alas, alas!""""Nay, I am sure you cannot have a better; for if I do not know anybody,it is impossible for me to talk to them; and, besides, I do not want totalk to anybody.""""Now you have given me a security worth having; and I shall proceedwith courage. Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour ofmaking the inquiry before?""""Yes, quite--more so, indeed.""""More so! Take care, or you will forget to be tired of it at the propertime. You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks.""""I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months.""""Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody findsout every year. 'For six weeks, I allow Bath is pleasant enough; butbeyond that, it is the most tiresome place in the world.' You would betold so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter,lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at last becausethey can afford to stay no longer.""""Well, other people must judge for themselves, and those who go toLondon may think nothing of Bath. But I, who live in a small retiredvillage in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a placeas this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, avariety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can knownothing of there.""""You are not fond of the country.""""Yes, I am. I have always lived there, and always been very happy. Butcertainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bathlife. One day in the country is exactly like another.""""But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country.""""Do I?""""Do you not?""""I do not believe there is much difference.""""Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long.""""And so I am at home--only I do not find so much of it. I walk abouthere, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in everystreet, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen.""Mr. Tilney was very much amused.""Only go and call on Mrs. Allen!"" he repeated. ""What a picture ofintellectual poverty! However, when you sink into this abyss again, youwill have more to say. You will be able to talk of Bath, and of all thatyou did here.""""Oh! Yes. I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs.Allen, or anybody else. I really believe I shall always be talking ofBath, when I am at home again--I do like it so very much. If I could buthave Papa and Mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose I should betoo happy! James's coming (my eldest brother) is quite delightful--andespecially as it turns out that the very family we are just got sointimate with are his intimate friends already. Oh! Who can ever betired of Bath?""""Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do.But papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good dealgone by, to most of the frequenters of Bath--and the honest relish ofballs and plays, and everyday sights, is past with them."" Heretheir conversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now tooimportunate for a divided attention.Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set, Catherine perceivedherself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among thelookers-on, immediately behind her partner. He was a very handsome man,of a commanding aspect, past the bloom, but not past the vigour oflife; and with his eye still directed towards her, she saw him presentlyaddress Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper. Confused by his notice, andblushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong inher appearance, she turned away her head. But while she did so, thegentleman retreated, and her partner, coming nearer, said, ""I see thatyou guess what I have just been asked. That gentleman knows your name,and you have a right to know his. It is General Tilney, my father.""Catherine's answer was only ""Oh!""--but it was an ""Oh!"" expressingeverything needful: attention to his words, and perfect reliance ontheir truth. With real interest and strong admiration did her eye nowfollow the general, as he moved through the crowd, and ""How handsome afamily they are!"" was her secret remark.In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new sourceof felicity arose to her. She had never taken a country walk sinceher arrival in Bath. Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequentedenvirons were familiar, spoke of them in terms which made her alleagerness to know them too; and on her openly fearing that she mightfind nobody to go with her, it was proposed by the brother and sisterthat they should join in a walk, some morning or other. ""I shall likeit,"" she cried, ""beyond anything in the world; and do not let us putit off--let us go tomorrow."" This was readily agreed to, with only aproviso of Miss Tilney's, that it did not rain, which Catherine was sureit would not. At twelve o'clock, they were to call for her in PulteneyStreet; and ""Remember--twelve o'clock,"" was her parting speech toher new friend. Of her other, her older, her more established friend,Isabella, of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight'sexperience, she scarcely saw anything during the evening. Yet, thoughlonging to make her acquainted with her happiness, she cheerfullysubmitted to the wish of Mr. Allen, which took them rather early away,and her spirits danced within her, as she danced in her chair all theway home."
Northanger Abbey,11,"CHAPTER 11The morrow brought a very sober-looking morning, the sun making onlya few efforts to appear, and Catherine augured from it everything mostfavourable to her wishes. A bright morning so early in the year,she allowed, would generally turn to rain, but a cloudy one foretoldimprovement as the day advanced. She applied to Mr. Allen forconfirmation of her hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having his own skies andbarometer about him, declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine.She applied to Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Allen's opinion was more positive.""She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if theclouds would only go off, and the sun keep out.""At about eleven o'clock, however, a few specks of small rain upon thewindows caught Catherine's watchful eye, and ""Oh! dear, I do believe itwill be wet,"" broke from her in a most desponding tone.""I thought how it would be,"" said Mrs. Allen.""No walk for me today,"" sighed Catherine; ""but perhaps it may come tonothing, or it may hold up before twelve.""""Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty.""""Oh! That will not signify; I never mind dirt.""""No,"" replied her friend very placidly, ""I know you never mind dirt.""After a short pause, ""It comes on faster and faster!"" said Catherine, asshe stood watching at a window.""So it does indeed. If it keeps raining, the streets will be very wet.""""There are four umbrellas up already. How I hate the sight of anumbrella!""""They are disagreeable things to carry. I would much rather take a chairat any time.""""It was such a nice-looking morning! I felt so convinced it would bedry!""""Anybody would have thought so indeed. There will be very few people inthe pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will puton his greatcoat when he goes, but I dare say he will not, for he hadrather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonderhe should dislike it, it must be so comfortable.""The rain continued--fast, though not heavy. Catherine went every fiveminutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it stillkept on raining another five minutes, she would give up the matter ashopeless. The clock struck twelve, and it still rained. ""You will not beable to go, my dear.""""I do not quite despair yet. I shall not give it up till a quarter aftertwelve. This is just the time of day for it to clear up, and I do thinkit looks a little lighter. There, it is twenty minutes after twelve, andnow I shall give it up entirely. Oh! That we had such weather hereas they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the south ofFrance!--the night that poor St. Aubin died!--such beautiful weather!""At half past twelve, when Catherine's anxious attention to the weatherwas over and she could no longer claim any merit from its amendment, thesky began voluntarily to clear. A gleam of sunshine took her quite bysurprise; she looked round; the clouds were parting, and she instantlyreturned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance.Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed,and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who had ""always thought itwould clear up."" But whether Catherine might still expect her friends,whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture,must yet be a question.It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her husband to thepump-room; he accordingly set off by himself, and Catherine had barelywatched him down the street when her notice was claimed by the approachof the same two open carriages, containing the same three people thathad surprised her so much a few mornings back.""Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare! They are coming forme perhaps--but I shall not go--I cannot go indeed, for you know MissTilney may still call."" Mrs. Allen agreed to it. John Thorpe was soonwith them, and his voice was with them yet sooner, for on the stairs hewas calling out to Miss Morland to be quick. ""Make haste! Make haste!""as he threw open the door. ""Put on your hat this moment--there is notime to be lost--we are going to Bristol. How d'ye do, Mrs. Allen?""""To Bristol! Is not that a great way off? But, however, I cannot go withyou today, because I am engaged; I expect some friends every moment.""This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all; Mrs.Allen was called on to second him, and the two others walked in, to givetheir assistance. ""My sweetest Catherine, is not this delightful? Weshall have a most heavenly drive. You are to thank your brother and mefor the scheme; it darted into our heads at breakfast-time, I verilybelieve at the same instant; and we should have been off two hours agoif it had not been for this detestable rain. But it does not signify,the nights are moonlight, and we shall do delightfully. Oh! I am in suchecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet! So muchbetter than going to the Lower Rooms. We shall drive directly to Cliftonand dine there; and, as soon as dinner is over, if there is time for it,go on to Kingsweston.""""I doubt our being able to do so much,"" said Morland.""You croaking fellow!"" cried Thorpe. ""We shall be able to do ten timesmore. Kingsweston! Aye, and Blaize Castle too, and anything else we canhear of; but here is your sister says she will not go.""""Blaize Castle!"" cried Catherine. ""What is that?""""The finest place in England--worth going fifty miles at any time tosee.""""What, is it really a castle, an old castle?""""The oldest in the kingdom.""""But is it like what one reads of?""""Exactly--the very same.""""But now really--are there towers and long galleries?""""By dozens.""""Then I should like to see it; but I cannot--I cannot go.""""Not go! My beloved creature, what do you mean?""""I cannot go, because""--looking down as she spoke, fearful of Isabella'ssmile--""I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take acountry walk. They promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but now,as it is so fine, I dare say they will be here soon.""""Not they indeed,"" cried Thorpe; ""for, as we turned into Broad Street, Isaw them--does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts?""""I do not know indeed.""""Yes, I know he does; I saw him. You are talking of the man you dancedwith last night, are not you?""""Yes.""""Well, I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road, driving asmart-looking girl.""""Did you indeed?""""Did upon my soul; knew him again directly, and he seemed to have gotsome very pretty cattle too.""""It is very odd! But I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for awalk.""""And well they might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life. Walk!You could no more walk than you could fly! It has not been so dirty thewhole winter; it is ankle-deep everywhere.""Isabella corroborated it: ""My dearest Catherine, you cannot form an ideaof the dirt; come, you must go; you cannot refuse going now.""""I should like to see the castle; but may we go all over it? May we goup every staircase, and into every suite of rooms?""""Yes, yes, every hole and corner.""""But then, if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer,and call by and by?""""Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for I heard Tilneyhallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback, that they weregoing as far as Wick Rocks.""""Then I will. Shall I go, Mrs. Allen?""""Just as you please, my dear.""""Mrs. Allen, you must persuade her to go,"" was the general cry. Mrs.Allen was not inattentive to it: ""Well, my dear,"" said she, ""suppose yougo."" And in two minutes they were off.Catherine's feelings, as she got into the carriage, were in a veryunsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one greatpleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal indegree, however unlike in kind. She could not think the Tilneys hadacted quite well by her, in so readily giving up their engagement,without sending her any message of excuse. It was now but an hour laterthan the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk; and, in spite ofwhat she had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the courseof that hour, she could not from her own observation help thinking thatthey might have gone with very little inconvenience. To feel herselfslighted by them was very painful. On the other hand, the delight ofexploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her fancy represented BlaizeCastle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console her foralmost anything.They passed briskly down Pulteney Street, and through Laura Place,without the exchange of many words. Thorpe talked to his horse, and shemeditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetonsand false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered ArgyleBuildings, however, she was roused by this address from her companion,""Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by?""""Who? Where?""""On the right-hand pavement--she must be almost out of sight now.""Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother's arm,walking slowly down the street. She saw them both looking back at her.""Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe,"" she impatiently cried; ""it is Miss Tilney; itis indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop, I willget out this moment and go to them."" But to what purpose did she speak?Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who hadsoon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight round thecorner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself whiskedinto the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of anotherstreet, she entreated him to stop. ""Pray, pray stop, Mr. Thorpe. Icannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss Tilney."" But Mr.Thorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his horse, made oddnoises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as she was, havingno power of getting away, was obliged to give up the point and submit.Her reproaches, however, were not spared. ""How could you deceive me so,Mr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them driving up the LansdownRoad? I would not have had it happen so for the world. They must thinkit so strange, so rude of me! To go by them, too, without saying a word!You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, norin anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now,and walk back to them. How could you say you saw them driving out in aphaeton?"" Thorpe defended himself very stoutly, declared he had neverseen two men so much alike in his life, and would hardly give up thepoint of its having been Tilney himself.Their drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be veryagreeable. Catherine's complaisance was no longer what it had been intheir former airing. She listened reluctantly, and her replies wereshort. Blaize Castle remained her only comfort; towards that, she stilllooked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be disappointed ofthe promised walk, and especially rather than be thought ill of by theTilneys, she would willingly have given up all the happiness which itswalls could supply--the happiness of a progress through a long suite oflofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture, thoughnow for many years deserted--the happiness of being stopped in their wayalong narrow, winding vaults, by a low, grated door; or even of havingtheir lamp, their only lamp, extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, andof being left in total darkness. In the meanwhile, they proceeded ontheir journey without any mischance, and were within view of the townof Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who was behind them, made hisfriend pull up, to know what was the matter. The others then came closeenough for conversation, and Morland said, ""We had better go back,Thorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well asI. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very littlemore than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more togo. It will never do. We set out a great deal too late. We had muchbetter put it off till another day, and turn round.""""It is all one to me,"" replied Thorpe rather angrily; and instantlyturning his horse, they were on their way back to Bath.""If your brother had not got such a d--beast to drive,"" said he soonafterwards, ""we might have done it very well. My horse would havetrotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to himself, and I havealmost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken-windedjade's pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of hisown.""""No, he is not,"" said Catherine warmly, ""for I am sure he could notafford it.""""And why cannot he afford it?""""Because he has not money enough.""""And whose fault is that?""""Nobody's, that I know of."" Thorpe then said something in the loud,incoherent way to which he had often recourse, about its being ad--thing to be miserly; and that if people who rolled in money could notafford things, he did not know who could, which Catherine did not evenendeavour to understand. Disappointed of what was to have been theconsolation for her first disappointment, she was less and less disposedeither to be agreeable herself or to find her companion so; and theyreturned to Pulteney Street without her speaking twenty words.As she entered the house, the footman told her that a gentleman and ladyhad called and inquired for her a few minutes after her setting off;that, when he told them she was gone out with Mr. Thorpe, the lady hadasked whether any message had been left for her; and on his saying no,had felt for a card, but said she had none about her, and went away.Pondering over these heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked slowlyupstairs. At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen, who, on hearingthe reason of their speedy return, said, ""I am glad your brother had somuch sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a strange, wild scheme.""They all spent the evening together at Thorpe's. Catherine was disturbedand out of spirits; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce, inthe fate of which she shared, by private partnership with Morland, avery good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton.Her satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken morethan once. ""How I pity the poor creatures that are going there! How gladI am that I am not amongst them! I wonder whether it will be a full ballor not! They have not begun dancing yet. I would not be there forall the world. It is so delightful to have an evening now and thento oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know theMitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is. But Idare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am sure youdo. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare saywe could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of suchconsequence.""Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting intenderness towards herself and her sorrows, so very little did theyappear to dwell on her mind, and so very inadequate was the comfort sheoffered. ""Do not be so dull, my dearest creature,"" she whispered. ""Youwill quite break my heart. It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; butthe Tilneys were entirely to blame. Why were not they more punctual?It was dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure John and Ishould not have minded it. I never mind going through anything, where afriend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same;he has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand youhave got! Kings, I vow! I never was so happy in my life! I would fiftytimes rather you should have them than myself.""And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch, which is thetrue heroine's portion; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet withtears. And lucky may she think herself, if she get another good night'srest in the course of the next three months."
Northanger Abbey,12,"CHAPTER 12""Mrs. Allen,"" said Catherine the next morning, ""will there be any harmin my calling on Miss Tilney today? I shall not be easy till I haveexplained everything.""""Go, by all means, my dear; only put on a white gown; Miss Tilney alwayswears white.""Catherine cheerfully complied, and being properly equipped, was moreimpatient than ever to be at the pump-room, that she might informherself of General Tilney's lodgings, for though she believed they werein Milsom Street, she was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen'swavering convictions only made it more doubtful. To Milsom Street shewas directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastenedaway with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her visit, explain herconduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, andresolutely turning away her eyes, that she might not be obliged tosee her beloved Isabella and her dear family, who, she had reason tobelieve, were in a shop hard by. She reached the house without anyimpediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired forMiss Tilney. The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was notquite certain. Would she be pleased to send up her name? She gave hercard. In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which didnot quite confirm his words, said he had been mistaken, for that MissTilney was walked out. Catherine, with a blush of mortification, leftthe house. She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney was at home, andtoo much offended to admit her; and as she retired down the street,could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, inexpectation of seeing her there, but no one appeared at them. At thebottom of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at awindow, but issuing from the door, she saw Miss Tilney herself. She wasfollowed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father,and they turned up towards Edgar's Buildings. Catherine, in deepmortification, proceeded on her way. She could almost be angry herselfat such angry incivility; but she checked the resentful sensation; sheremembered her own ignorance. She knew not how such an offence as hersmight be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degreeof unforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours ofrudeness in return it might justly make her amenable.Dejected and humbled, she had even some thoughts of not going with theothers to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that theywere not of long continuance, for she soon recollected, in the firstplace, that she was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in thesecond, that it was a play she wanted very much to see. To the theatreaccordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her;she feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondnessfor plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they werehabituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which sheknew, on Isabella's authority, rendered everything else of the kind""quite horrid."" She was not deceived in her own expectation of pleasure;the comedy so well suspended her care that no one, observing her duringthe first four acts, would have supposed she had any wretchedness abouther. On the beginning of the fifth, however, the sudden view of Mr.Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the opposite box,recalled her to anxiety and distress. The stage could no longer excitegenuine merriment--no longer keep her whole attention. Every other lookupon an average was directed towards the opposite box; and, for thespace of two entire scenes, did she thus watch Henry Tilney, withoutbeing once able to catch his eye. No longer could he be suspected ofindifference for a play; his notice was never withdrawn from the stageduring two whole scenes. At length, however, he did look towards her,and he bowed--but such a bow! No smile, no continued observance attendedit; his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction.Catherine was restlessly miserable; she could almost have run round tothe box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation. Feelingsrather natural than heroic possessed her; instead of considering herown dignity injured by this ready condemnation--instead of proudlyresolving, in conscious innocence, to show her resentment towards himwho could harbour a doubt of it, to leave to him all the troubleof seeking an explanation, and to enlighten him on the past only byavoiding his sight, or flirting with somebody else--she took to herselfall the shame of misconduct, or at least of its appearance, and was onlyeager for an opportunity of explaining its cause.The play concluded--the curtain fell--Henry Tilney was no longer to beseen where he had hitherto sat, but his father remained, and perhaps hemight be now coming round to their box. She was right; in a few minuteshe appeared, and, making his way through the then thinning rows, spokewith like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend. Not with suchcalmness was he answered by the latter: ""Oh! Mr. Tilney, I have beenquite wild to speak to you, and make my apologies. You must have thoughtme so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs. Allen?Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in aphaeton together? And then what could I do? But I had ten thousand timesrather have been with you; now had not I, Mrs. Allen?""""My dear, you tumble my gown,"" was Mrs. Allen's reply.Her assurance, however, standing sole as it did, was not thrown away; itbrought a more cordial, more natural smile into his countenance, andhe replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve:""We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walkafter our passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look backon purpose.""""But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk; I never thought of sucha thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out tohim as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not--Oh! You werenot there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped,I would have jumped out and run after you.""Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such adeclaration? Henry Tilney at least was not. With a yet sweeter smile, hesaid everything that need be said of his sister's concern, regret, anddependence on Catherine's honour. ""Oh! Do not say Miss Tilney was notangry,"" cried Catherine, ""because I know she was; for she would not seeme this morning when I called; I saw her walk out of the house the nextminute after my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted. Perhapsyou did not know I had been there.""""I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from Eleanor, and shehas been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of suchincivility; but perhaps I can do it as well. It was nothing more thanthat my father--they were just preparing to walk out, and he beinghurried for time, and not caring to have it put off--made a point of herbeing denied. That was all, I do assure you. She was very much vexed,and meant to make her apology as soon as possible.""Catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information, yet a somethingof solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question,thoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to thegentleman: ""But, Mr. Tilney, why were you less generous than yoursister? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions, and couldsuppose it to be only a mistake, why should you be so ready to takeoffence?""""Me! I take offence!""""Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the box, you wereangry.""""I angry! I could have no right.""""Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face."" Hereplied by asking her to make room for him, and talking of the play.He remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable forCatherine to be contented when he went away. Before they parted,however, it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soonas possible; and, setting aside the misery of his quitting their box,she was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in theworld.While talking to each other, she had observed with some surprise thatJohn Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutestogether, was engaged in conversation with General Tilney; and she feltsomething more than surprise when she thought she could perceive herselfthe object of their attention and discourse. What could they have to sayof her? She feared General Tilney did not like her appearance: she foundit was implied in his preventing her admittance to his daughter, ratherthan postpone his own walk a few minutes. ""How came Mr. Thorpe to knowyour father?"" was her anxious inquiry, as she pointed them out to hercompanion. He knew nothing about it; but his father, like every militaryman, had a very large acquaintance.When the entertainment was over, Thorpe came to assist them in gettingout. Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry; and, whilethey waited in the lobby for a chair, he prevented the inquiry which hadtravelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue, by asking, ina consequential manner, whether she had seen him talking with GeneralTilney: ""He is a fine old fellow, upon my soul! Stout, active--looksas young as his son. I have a great regard for him, I assure you: agentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived.""""But how came you to know him?""""Know him! There are few people much about town that I do not know. Ihave met him forever at the Bedford; and I knew his face again today themoment he came into the billiard-room. One of the best players we have,by the by; and we had a little touch together, though I was almostafraid of him at first: the odds were five to four against me; and, ifI had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made inthis world--I took his ball exactly--but I could not make you understandit without a table; however, I did beat him. A very fine fellow; as richas a Jew. I should like to dine with him; I dare say he gives famousdinners. But what do you think we have been talking of? You. Yes, byheavens! And the general thinks you the finest girl in Bath.""""Oh! Nonsense! How can you say so?""""And what do you think I said?""--lowering his voice--""well done,general, said I; I am quite of your mind.""Here Catherine, who was much less gratified by his admiration than byGeneral Tilney's, was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen. Thorpe,however, would see her to her chair, and, till she entered it, continuedthe same kind of delicate flattery, in spite of her entreating him tohave done.That General Tilney, instead of disliking, should admire her, was verydelightful; and she joyfully thought that there was not one of thefamily whom she need now fear to meet. The evening had done more, muchmore, for her than could have been expected."
Northanger Abbey,13,"CHAPTER 13Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have nowpassed in review before the reader; the events of each day, its hopesand fears, mortifications and pleasures, have been separately stated,and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described, and close theweek. The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and onthe afternoon's Crescent of this day, it was brought forward again. In aprivate consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom hadparticularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no less anxiouslyplaced his upon pleasing her, it was agreed that, provided the weatherwere fair, the party should take place on the following morning; andthey were to set off very early, in order to be at home in good time.The affair thus determined, and Thorpe's approbation secured, Catherineonly remained to be apprised of it. She had left them for a few minutesto speak to Miss Tilney. In that interval the plan was completed, and assoon as she came again, her agreement was demanded; but instead of thegay acquiescence expected by Isabella, Catherine looked grave, was verysorry, but could not go. The engagement which ought to have kept herfrom joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her toaccompany them now. She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to taketheir proposed walk tomorrow; it was quite determined, and she wouldnot, upon any account, retract. But that she must and should retractwas instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes; they must go to Cliftontomorrow, they would not go without her, it would be nothing to put offa mere walk for one day longer, and they would not hear of a refusal.Catherine was distressed, but not subdued. ""Do not urge me, Isabella. Iam engaged to Miss Tilney. I cannot go."" This availed nothing. The samearguments assailed her again; she must go, she should go, and they wouldnot hear of a refusal. ""It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that youhad just been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to putoff the walk till Tuesday.""""No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no priorengagement."" But Isabella became only more and more urgent, callingon her in the most affectionate manner, addressing her by the mostendearing names. She was sure her dearest, sweetest Catherine would notseriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her sodearly. She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, sosweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she loved. But allin vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though painedby such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it toinfluence her. Isabella then tried another method. She reproached herwith having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she had known her solittle a while, than for her best and oldest friends, with being growncold and indifferent, in short, towards herself. ""I cannot help beingjealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, wholove you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is notin the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings arestronger than anybody's; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace;and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut meto the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else.""Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind. Was it thepart of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others?Isabella appeared to her ungenerous and selfish, regardless ofeverything but her own gratification. These painful ideas crossed hermind, though she said nothing. Isabella, in the meanwhile, had appliedher handkerchief to her eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight,could not help saying, ""Nay, Catherine. I think you cannot stand out anylonger now. The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a friend--Ishall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse.""This was the first time of her brother's openly siding against her, andanxious to avoid his displeasure, she proposed a compromise. If theywould only put off their scheme till Tuesday, which they might easilydo, as it depended only on themselves, she could go with them, andeverybody might then be satisfied. But ""No, no, no!"" was the immediateanswer; ""that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he might notgo to town on Tuesday."" Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; anda short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice ofcold resentment said, ""Very well, then there is an end of the party.If Catherine does not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I wouldnot, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing.""""Catherine, you must go,"" said James.""But why cannot Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters? I dare sayeither of them would like to go.""""Thank ye,"" cried Thorpe, ""but I did not come to Bath to drive mysisters about, and look like a fool. No, if you do not go, d---- me if Ido. I only go for the sake of driving you.""""That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure."" But her words werelost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away.The three others still continued together, walking in a mostuncomfortable manner to poor Catherine; sometimes not a word was said,sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, andher arm was still linked within Isabella's, though their hearts wereat war. At one moment she was softened, at another irritated; alwaysdistressed, but always steady.""I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,"" said James;""you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the kindest,best-tempered of my sisters.""""I hope I am not less so now,"" she replied, very feelingly; ""but indeedI cannot go. If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right.""""I suspect,"" said Isabella, in a low voice, ""there is no greatstruggle.""Catherine's heart swelled; she drew away her arm, and Isabella made noopposition. Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joinedby Thorpe, who, coming to them with a gayer look, said, ""Well, Ihave settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safeconscience. I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses.""""You have not!"" cried Catherine.""I have, upon my soul. Left her this moment. Told her you had sent me tosay that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Cliftonwith us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking with hertill Tuesday. She said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to her;so there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty good thought ofmine--hey?""Isabella's countenance was once more all smiles and good humour, andJames too looked happy again.""A most heavenly thought indeed! Now, my sweet Catherine, all ourdistresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have amost delightful party.""""This will not do,"" said Catherine; ""I cannot submit to this. I must runafter Miss Tilney directly and set her right.""Isabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, andremonstrances poured in from all three. Even James was quite angry. Wheneverything was settled, when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday wouldsuit her as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make anyfurther objection.""I do not care. Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message.If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to MissTilney myself. This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I knowthat Mr. Thorpe has--He may be mistaken again perhaps; he led me intoone act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday. Let me go, Mr. Thorpe;Isabella, do not hold me.""Thorpe told her it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they wereturning the corner into Brock Street, when he had overtaken them, andwere at home by this time.""Then I will go after them,"" said Catherine; ""wherever they are I willgo after them. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuadedinto doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it.""And with these words she broke away and hurried off. Thorpe would havedarted after her, but Morland withheld him. ""Let her go, let her go, ifshe will go.""""She is as obstinate as--""Thorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been a properone.Away walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd wouldpermit her, fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere. Asshe walked, she reflected on what had passed. It was painful to her todisappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her brother;but she could not repent her resistance. Setting her own inclinationapart, to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney, tohave retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before,and on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. She had not beenwithstanding them on selfish principles alone, she had not consultedmerely her own gratification; that might have been ensured in somedegree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she hadattended to what was due to others, and to her own character in theiropinion. Her conviction of being right, however, was not enough torestore her composure; till she had spoken to Miss Tilney she could notbe at ease; and quickening her pace when she got clear of the Crescent,she almost ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top ofMilsom Street. So rapid had been her movements that in spite of theTilneys' advantage in the outset, they were but just turning intotheir lodgings as she came within view of them; and the servant stillremaining at the open door, she used only the ceremony of sayingthat she must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by himproceeded upstairs. Then, opening the first door before her, whichhappened to be the right, she immediately found herself in thedrawing-room with General Tilney, his son, and daughter. Herexplanation, defective only in being--from her irritation of nerves andshortness of breath--no explanation at all, was instantly given. ""I amcome in a great hurry--It was all a mistake--I never promised to go--Itold them from the first I could not go.--I ran away in a great hurryto explain it.--I did not care what you thought of me.--I would not stayfor the servant.""The business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech,soon ceased to be a puzzle. Catherine found that John Thorpe had giventhe message; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatlysurprised by it. But whether her brother had still exceeded her inresentment, Catherine, though she instinctively addressed herself asmuch to one as to the other in her vindication, had no means of knowing.Whatever might have been felt before her arrival, her eager declarationsimmediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she coulddesire.The affair thus happily settled, she was introduced by Miss Tilneyto her father, and received by him with such ready, such solicitouspoliteness as recalled Thorpe's information to her mind, and made herthink with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on. To suchanxious attention was the general's civility carried, that not aware ofher extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he was quite angrywith the servant whose neglect had reduced her to open the door of theapartment herself. ""What did William mean by it? He should make a pointof inquiring into the matter."" And if Catherine had not most warmlyasserted his innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose thefavour of his master forever, if not his place, by her rapidity.After sitting with them a quarter of an hour, she rose to take leave,and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney's asking her ifshe would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the restof the day with her. Miss Tilney added her own wishes. Catherine wasgreatly obliged; but it was quite out of her power. Mr. and Mrs. Allenwould expect her back every moment. The general declared he could say nomore; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded; but onsome other day he trusted, when longer notice could be given, they wouldnot refuse to spare her to her friend. ""Oh, no; Catherine was sure theywould not have the least objection, and she should have great pleasurein coming."" The general attended her himself to the street-door, sayingeverything gallant as they went downstairs, admiring the elasticity ofher walk, which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing, andmaking her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld, when theyparted.Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to PulteneyStreet, walking, as she concluded, with great elasticity, though shehad never thought of it before. She reached home without seeing anythingmore of the offended party; and now that she had been triumphantthroughout, had carried her point, and was secure of her walk, she began(as the flutter of her spirits subsided) to doubt whether she had beenperfectly right. A sacrifice was always noble; and if she had given wayto their entreaties, she should have been spared the distressing idea ofa friend displeased, a brother angry, and a scheme of great happinessto both destroyed, perhaps through her means. To ease her mind, andascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conducthad really been, she took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen thehalf-settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the followingday. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. ""Well,"" said he, ""and do you thinkof going too?""""No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they toldme of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could I?""""No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it. These schemesare not at all the thing. Young men and women driving about the countryin open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns andpublic places together! It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe shouldallow it. I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Mrs. Morlandwould not be pleased. Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of thinking? Donot you think these kind of projects objectionable?""""Yes, very much so indeed. Open carriages are nasty things. A cleangown is not five minutes' wear in them. You are splashed getting inand getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in everydirection. I hate an open carriage myself.""""I know you do; but that is not the question. Do not you think it has anodd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in them byyoung men, to whom they are not even related?""""Yes, my dear, a very odd appearance indeed. I cannot bear to see it.""""Dear madam,"" cried Catherine, ""then why did not you tell me so before?I am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone withMr. Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thoughtI was doing wrong.""""And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Mrs.Morland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power. Butone must not be over particular. Young people will be young people,as your good mother says herself. You know I wanted you, when we firstcame, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would. Young people donot like to be always thwarted.""""But this was something of real consequence; and I do not think youwould have found me hard to persuade.""""As far as it has gone hitherto, there is no harm done,"" said Mr. Allen;""and I would only advise you, my dear, not to go out with Mr. Thorpe anymore.""""That is just what I was going to say,"" added his wife.Catherine, relieved for herself, felt uneasy for Isabella, and after amoment's thought, asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both properand kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe, and explain the indecorum ofwhich she must be as insensible as herself; for she considered thatIsabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day, inspite of what had passed. Mr. Allen, however, discouraged her from doingany such thing. ""You had better leave her alone, my dear; she is oldenough to know what she is about, and if not, has a mother to adviseher. Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt; but, however, you hadbetter not interfere. She and your brother choose to go, and you will beonly getting ill will.""Catherine submitted, and though sorry to think that Isabella should bedoing wrong, felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen's approbation of herown conduct, and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from thedanger of falling into such an error herself. Her escape from being oneof the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed; for what would theTilneys have thought of her, if she had broken her promise to them inorder to do what was wrong in itself, if she had been guilty of onebreach of propriety, only to enable her to be guilty of another?"
Northanger Abbey,14,"CHAPTER 14The next morning was fair, and Catherine almost expected another attackfrom the assembled party. With Mr. Allen to support her, she felt nodread of the event: but she would gladly be spared a contest, wherevictory itself was painful, and was heartily rejoiced therefore atneither seeing nor hearing anything of them. The Tilneys called forher at the appointed time; and no new difficulty arising, no suddenrecollection, no unexpected summons, no impertinent intrusion todisconcert their measures, my heroine was most unnaturally able tofulfil her engagement, though it was made with the hero himself.They determined on walking round Beechen Cliff, that noble hill whosebeautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an objectfrom almost every opening in Bath.""I never look at it,"" said Catherine, as they walked along the side ofthe river, ""without thinking of the south of France.""""You have been abroad then?"" said Henry, a little surprised.""Oh! No, I only mean what I have read about. It always puts me in mindof the country that Emily and her father travelled through, in TheMysteries of Udolpho. But you never read novels, I dare say?""""Why not?""""Because they are not clever enough for you--gentlemen read betterbooks.""""The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a goodnovel, must be intolerably stupid. I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe'sworks, and most of them with great pleasure. The Mysteries of Udolpho,when I had once begun it, I could not lay down again; I rememberfinishing it in two days--my hair standing on end the whole time.""""Yes,"" added Miss Tilney, ""and I remember that you undertook to read italoud to me, and that when I was called away for only five minutes toanswer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume into theHermitage Walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it.""""Thank you, Eleanor--a most honourable testimony. You see, Miss Morland,the injustice of your suspicions. Here was I, in my eagerness to get on,refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister, breaking the promiseI had made of reading it aloud, and keeping her in suspense at a mostinteresting part, by running away with the volume, which, you are toobserve, was her own, particularly her own. I am proud when I reflect onit, and I think it must establish me in your good opinion.""""I am very glad to hear it indeed, and now I shall never be ashamed ofliking Udolpho myself. But I really thought before, young men despisednovels amazingly.""""It is amazingly; it may well suggest amazement if they do--for theyread nearly as many as women. I myself have read hundreds and hundreds.Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias andLouisas. If we proceed to particulars, and engage in the never-ceasinginquiry of 'Have you read this?' and 'Have you read that?' I shall soonleave you as far behind me as--what shall I say?--I want an appropriatesimile.--as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt whenshe went with her aunt into Italy. Consider how many years I have hadthe start of you. I had entered on my studies at Oxford, while you werea good little girl working your sampler at home!""""Not very good, I am afraid. But now really, do not you think Udolphothe nicest book in the world?""""The nicest--by which I suppose you mean the neatest. That must dependupon the binding.""""Henry,"" said Miss Tilney, ""you are very impertinent. Miss Morland, heis treating you exactly as he does his sister. He is forever findingfault with me, for some incorrectness of language, and now he is takingthe same liberty with you. The word 'nicest,' as you used it, did notsuit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shallbe overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.""""I am sure,"" cried Catherine, ""I did not mean to say anything wrong; butit is a nice book, and why should not I call it so?""""Very true,"" said Henry, ""and this is a very nice day, and we are takinga very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It is avery nice word indeed! It does for everything. Originally perhaps itwas applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, orrefinement--people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, ortheir choice. But now every commendation on every subject is comprisedin that one word.""""While, in fact,"" cried his sister, ""it ought only to be applied to you,without any commendation at all. You are more nice than wise. Come,Miss Morland, let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmostpropriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms welike best. It is a most interesting work. You are fond of that kind ofreading?""""To say the truth, I do not much like any other.""""Indeed!""""That is, I can read poetry and plays, and things of that sort, anddo not dislike travels. But history, real solemn history, I cannot beinterested in. Can you?""""Yes, I am fond of history.""""I wish I were too. I read it a little as a duty, but it tells menothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes andkings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good fornothing, and hardly any women at all--it is very tiresome: and yet Ioften think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of itmust be invention. The speeches that are put into the heroes' mouths,their thoughts and designs--the chief of all this must be invention, andinvention is what delights me in other books.""""Historians, you think,"" said Miss Tilney, ""are not happy in theirflights of fancy. They display imagination without raising interest. Iam fond of history--and am very well contented to take the false withthe true. In the principal facts they have sources of intelligencein former histories and records, which may be as much depended on,I conclude, as anything that does not actually pass under one's ownobservation; and as for the little embellishments you speak of, they areembellishments, and I like them as such. If a speech be well drawn up,I read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be made--and probably withmuch greater, if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson, than ifthe genuine words of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the Great.""""You are fond of history! And so are Mr. Allen and my father; and I havetwo brothers who do not dislike it. So many instances within my smallcircle of friends is remarkable! At this rate, I shall not pity thewriters of history any longer. If people like to read their books, itis all very well, but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes,which, as I used to think, nobody would willingly ever look into, to belabouring only for the torment of little boys and girls, always struckme as a hard fate; and though I know it is all very right and necessary,I have often wondered at the person's courage that could sit down onpurpose to do it.""""That little boys and girls should be tormented,"" said Henry, ""is whatno one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state candeny; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians, I must observethat they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higheraim, and that by their method and style, they are perfectly wellqualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and maturetime of life. I use the verb 'to torment,' as I observed to be your ownmethod, instead of 'to instruct,' supposing them to be now admitted assynonymous.""""You think me foolish to call instruction a torment, but if you had beenas much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning theirletters and then learning to spell, if you had ever seen how stupid theycan be for a whole morning together, and how tired my poor mother isat the end of it, as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of mylife at home, you would allow that 'to torment' and 'to instruct' mightsometimes be used as synonymous words.""""Very probably. But historians are not accountable for the difficultyof learning to read; and even you yourself, who do not altogether seemparticularly friendly to very severe, very intense application, mayperhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth-while tobe tormented for two or three years of one's life, for the sake ofbeing able to read all the rest of it. Consider--if reading had not beentaught, Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain--or perhaps might nothave written at all.""Catherine assented--and a very warm panegyric from her on that lady'smerits closed the subject. The Tilneys were soon engaged in another onwhich she had nothing to say. They were viewing the country with theeyes of persons accustomed to drawing, and decided on its capability ofbeing formed into pictures, with all the eagerness of real taste. HereCatherine was quite lost. She knew nothing of drawing--nothing of taste:and she listened to them with an attention which brought her littleprofit, for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any ideato her. The little which she could understand, however, appeared tocontradict the very few notions she had entertained on the matterbefore. It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from thetop of an high hill, and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proofof a fine day. She was heartily ashamed of her ignorance. A misplacedshame. Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant.To come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability ofadministering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person wouldalways wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune ofknowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can.The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been alreadyset forth by the capital pen of a sister author; and to her treatmentof the subject I will only add, in justice to men, that though to thelarger and more trifling part of the sex, imbecility in females is agreat enhancement of their personal charms, there is a portion of themtoo reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anythingmore in woman than ignorance. But Catherine did not know her ownadvantages--did not know that a good-looking girl, with an affectionateheart and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever youngman, unless circumstances are particularly untoward. In the presentinstance, she confessed and lamented her want of knowledge, declaredthat she would give anything in the world to be able to draw; anda lecture on the picturesque immediately followed, in which hisinstructions were so clear that she soon began to see beauty ineverything admired by him, and her attention was so earnest that hebecame perfectly satisfied of her having a great deal of natural taste.He talked of foregrounds, distances, and second distances--side-screensand perspectives--lights and shades; and Catherine was so hopeful ascholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff, she voluntarilyrejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape.Delighted with her progress, and fearful of wearying her with too muchwisdom at once, Henry suffered the subject to decline, and by an easytransition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak whichhe had placed near its summit, to oaks in general, to forests, theenclosure of them, waste lands, crown lands and government, he shortlyfound himself arrived at politics; and from politics, it was aneasy step to silence. The general pause which succeeded his shortdisquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by Catherine,who, in rather a solemn tone of voice, uttered these words, ""I haveheard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London.""Miss Tilney, to whom this was chiefly addressed, was startled, andhastily replied, ""Indeed! And of what nature?""""That I do not know, nor who is the author. I have only heard that it isto be more horrible than anything we have met with yet.""""Good heaven! Where could you hear of such a thing?""""A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter fromLondon yesterday. It is to be uncommonly dreadful. I shall expect murderand everything of the kind.""""You speak with astonishing composure! But I hope your friend's accountshave been exaggerated; and if such a design is known beforehand, propermeasures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its comingto effect.""""Government,"" said Henry, endeavouring not to smile, ""neither desiresnor dares to interfere in such matters. There must be murder; andgovernment cares not how much.""The ladies stared. He laughed, and added, ""Come, shall I make youunderstand each other, or leave you to puzzle out an explanation asyou can? No--I will be noble. I will prove myself a man, no less by thegenerosity of my soul than the clearness of my head. I have no patiencewith such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to thecomprehension of yours. Perhaps the abilities of women are neither soundnor acute--neither vigorous nor keen. Perhaps they may want observation,discernment, judgment, fire, genius, and wit.""""Miss Morland, do not mind what he says; but have the goodness tosatisfy me as to this dreadful riot.""""Riot! What riot?""""My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain. The confusionthere is scandalous. Miss Morland has been talking of nothing moredreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in threeduodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, witha frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern--do youunderstand? And you, Miss Morland--my stupid sister has mistaken allyour clearest expressions. You talked of expected horrors in London--andinstead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature would havedone, that such words could relate only to a circulating library, sheimmediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assemblingin St. George's Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, thestreets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth LightDragoons (the hopes of the nation) called up from Northampton to quellthe insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in themoment of charging at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by abrickbat from an upper window. Forgive her stupidity. The fears of thesister have added to the weakness of the woman; but she is by no means asimpleton in general.""Catherine looked grave. ""And now, Henry,"" said Miss Tilney, ""that youhave made us understand each other, you may as well make Miss Morlandunderstand yourself--unless you mean to have her think you intolerablyrude to your sister, and a great brute in your opinion of women ingeneral. Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways.""""I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them.""""No doubt; but that is no explanation of the present.""""What am I to do?""""You know what you ought to do. Clear your character handsomely beforeher. Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women.""""Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding of all the womenin the world--especially of those--whoever they may be--with whom Ihappen to be in company.""""That is not enough. Be more serious.""""Miss Morland, no one can think more highly of the understanding ofwomen than I do. In my opinion, nature has given them so much that theynever find it necessary to use more than half.""""We shall get nothing more serious from him now, Miss Morland. He isnot in a sober mood. But I do assure you that he must be entirelymisunderstood, if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any womanat all, or an unkind one of me.""It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could neverbe wrong. His manner might sometimes surprise, but his meaning mustalways be just: and what she did not understand, she was almost as readyto admire, as what she did. The whole walk was delightful, and though itended too soon, its conclusion was delightful too; her friends attendedher into the house, and Miss Tilney, before they parted, addressingherself with respectful form, as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine,petitioned for the pleasure of her company to dinner on the day afterthe next. No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen's side, and the onlydifficulty on Catherine's was in concealing the excess of her pleasure.The morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all herfriendship and natural affection, for no thought of Isabella or Jameshad crossed her during their walk. When the Tilneys were gone, shebecame amiable again, but she was amiable for some time to littleeffect; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve heranxiety; she had heard nothing of any of them. Towards the end of themorning, however, Catherine, having occasion for some indispensable yardof ribbon which must be bought without a moment's delay, walked out intothe town, and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she wasloitering towards Edgar's Buildings between two of the sweetest girls inthe world, who had been her dear friends all the morning. From her, shesoon learned that the party to Clifton had taken place. ""They set off ateight this morning,"" said Miss Anne, ""and I am sure I do not envythem their drive. I think you and I are very well off to be out of thescrape. It must be the dullest thing in the world, for there is not asoul at Clifton at this time of year. Belle went with your brother, andJohn drove Maria.""Catherine spoke the pleasure she really felt on hearing this part of thearrangement.""Oh! yes,"" rejoined the other, ""Maria is gone. She was quite wild to go.She thought it would be something very fine. I cannot say I admire hertaste; and for my part, I was determined from the first not to go, ifthey pressed me ever so much.""Catherine, a little doubtful of this, could not help answering, ""I wishyou could have gone too. It is a pity you could not all go.""""Thank you; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me. Indeed, Iwould not have gone on any account. I was saying so to Emily and Sophiawhen you overtook us.""Catherine was still unconvinced; but glad that Anne should have thefriendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her, she bade her adieuwithout much uneasiness, and returned home, pleased that the party hadnot been prevented by her refusing to join it, and very heartily wishingthat it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella toresent her resistance any longer."
Northanger Abbey,15,"CHAPTER 15Early the next day, a note from Isabella, speaking peace and tendernessin every line, and entreating the immediate presence of her friend ona matter of the utmost importance, hastened Catherine, in the happieststate of confidence and curiosity, to Edgar's Buildings. The twoyoungest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour; and, on Anne'squitting it to call her sister, Catherine took the opportunity of askingthe other for some particulars of their yesterday's party. Maria desiredno greater pleasure than to speak of it; and Catherine immediatelylearnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in theworld, that nobody could imagine how charming it had been, and thatit had been more delightful than anybody could conceive. Such was theinformation of the first five minutes; the second unfolded thus much indetail--that they had driven directly to the York Hotel, ate some soup,and bespoke an early dinner, walked down to the pump-room, tasted thewater, and laid out some shillings in purses and spars; thence adjournedto eat ice at a pastry-cook's, and hurrying back to the hotel, swallowedtheir dinner in haste, to prevent being in the dark; and then had adelightful drive back, only the moon was not up, and it rained a little,and Mr. Morland's horse was so tired he could hardly get it along.Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction. It appeared that BlaizeCastle had never been thought of; and, as for all the rest, there wasnothing to regret for half an instant. Maria's intelligence concludedwith a tender effusion of pity for her sister Anne, whom she representedas insupportably cross, from being excluded the party.""She will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I helpit? John would have me go, for he vowed he would not drive her, becauseshe had such thick ankles. I dare say she will not be in good humouragain this month; but I am determined I will not be cross; it is not alittle matter that puts me out of temper.""Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step, and a look of suchhappy importance, as engaged all her friend's notice. Maria was withoutceremony sent away, and Isabella, embracing Catherine, thus began: ""Yes,my dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has not deceivedyou. Oh! That arch eye of yours! It sees through everything.""Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance.""Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend,"" continued the other, ""composeyourself. I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive. Let us sit down andtalk in comfort. Well, and so you guessed it the moment you had my note?Sly creature! Oh! My dear Catherine, you alone, who know my heart, canjudge of my present happiness. Your brother is the most charming ofmen. I only wish I were more worthy of him. But what will your excellentfather and mother say? Oh! Heavens! When I think of them I am soagitated!""Catherine's understanding began to awake: an idea of the truth suddenlydarted into her mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion,she cried out, ""Good heaven! My dear Isabella, what do you mean? Canyou--can you really be in love with James?""This bold surmise, however, she soon learnt comprehended but half thefact. The anxious affection, which she was accused of having continuallywatched in Isabella's every look and action, had, in the course of theiryesterday's party, received the delightful confession of an equal love.Her heart and faith were alike engaged to James. Never had Catherinelistened to anything so full of interest, wonder, and joy. Her brotherand her friend engaged! New to such circumstances, the importance ofit appeared unspeakably great, and she contemplated it as one of thosegrand events, of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford areturn. The strength of her feelings she could not express; the natureof them, however, contented her friend. The happiness of having such asister was their first effusion, and the fair ladies mingled in embracesand tears of joy.Delighting, however, as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of theconnection, it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed herin tender anticipations. ""You will be so infinitely dearer to me, myCatherine, than either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so muchmore attached to my dear Morland's family than to my own.""This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine.""You are so like your dear brother,"" continued Isabella, ""that I quitedoted on you the first moment I saw you. But so it always is with me;the first moment settles everything. The very first day that Morlandcame to us last Christmas--the very first moment I beheld him--my heartwas irrecoverably gone. I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hairdone up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and Johnintroduced him, I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before.""Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love; for, thoughexceedingly fond of her brother, and partial to all his endowments, shehad never in her life thought him handsome.""I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and woreher puce-coloured sarsenet; and she looked so heavenly that I thoughtyour brother must certainly fall in love with her; I could not sleepa wink all right for thinking of it. Oh! Catherine, the many sleeplessnights I have had on your brother's account! I would not have you sufferhalf what I have done! I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I willnot pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it. Ifeel that I have betrayed myself perpetually--so unguarded in speakingof my partiality for the church! But my secret I was always sure wouldbe safe with you.""Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer; but ashamed of anignorance little expected, she dared no longer contest the point,nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionatesympathy as Isabella chose to consider her. Her brother, she found,was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton, to make known hissituation and ask consent; and here was a source of some real agitationto the mind of Isabella. Catherine endeavoured to persuade her, as shewas herself persuaded, that her father and mother would never opposetheir son's wishes. ""It is impossible,"" said she, ""for parents to bemore kind, or more desirous of their children's happiness; I have nodoubt of their consenting immediately.""""Morland says exactly the same,"" replied Isabella; ""and yet I dare notexpect it; my fortune will be so small; they never can consent to it.Your brother, who might marry anybody!""Here Catherine again discerned the force of love.""Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble. The difference of fortune can benothing to signify.""""Oh! My sweet Catherine, in your generous heart I know it would signifynothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many. As formyself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed. Had I thecommand of millions, were I mistress of the whole world, your brotherwould be my only choice.""This charming sentiment, recommended as much by sense as novelty,gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of heracquaintance; and she thought her friend never looked more lovely thanin uttering the grand idea. ""I am sure they will consent,"" was herfrequent declaration; ""I am sure they will be delighted with you.""""For my own part,"" said Isabella, ""my wishes are so moderate that thesmallest income in nature would be enough for me. Where people arereally attached, poverty itself is wealth; grandeur I detest: I wouldnot settle in London for the universe. A cottage in some retired villagewould be ecstasy. There are some charming little villas about Richmond.""""Richmond!"" cried Catherine. ""You must settle near Fullerton. You mustbe near us.""""I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not. If I can but be near you,I shall be satisfied. But this is idle talking! I will not allow myselfto think of such things, till we have your father's answer. Morlandsays that by sending it tonight to Salisbury, we may have it tomorrow.Tomorrow? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter. I knowit will be the death of me.""A reverie succeeded this conviction--and when Isabella spoke again, itwas to resolve on the quality of her wedding-gown.Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself,who came to breathe his parting sigh before he set off for Wiltshire.Catherine wished to congratulate him, but knew not what to say, and hereloquence was only in her eyes. From them, however, the eight parts ofspeech shone out most expressively, and James could combine them withease. Impatient for the realization of all that he hoped at home, hisadieus were not long; and they would have been yet shorter, had he notbeen frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his fair one thathe would go. Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagernessto have him gone. ""Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away. Consider howfar you have to ride. I cannot bear to see you linger so. For heaven'ssake, waste no more time. There, go, go--I insist on it.""The two friends, with hearts now more united than ever, were inseparablefor the day; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along.Mrs. Thorpe and her son, who were acquainted with everything, andwho seemed only to want Mr. Morland's consent, to consider Isabella'sengagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for theirfamily, were allowed to join their counsels, and add their quota ofsignificant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measureof curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters. ToCatherine's simple feelings, this odd sort of reserve seemed neitherkindly meant, nor consistently supported; and its unkindness she wouldhardly have forborne pointing out, had its inconsistency been less theirfriend; but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity oftheir ""I know what""; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit,a display of family ingenuity, on one side in the mystery of an affectedsecret, on the other of undefined discovery, all equally acute.Catherine was with her friend again the next day, endeavouring tosupport her spirits and while away the many tedious hours beforethe delivery of the letters; a needful exertion, for as the timeof reasonable expectation drew near, Isabella became more and moredesponding, and before the letter arrived, had worked herself into astate of real distress. But when it did come, where could distressbe found? ""I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kindparents, and am promised that everything in their power shall be done toforward my happiness,"" were the first three lines, and in one momentall was joyful security. The brightest glow was instantly spread overIsabella's features, all care and anxiety seemed removed, her spiritsbecame almost too high for control, and she called herself withoutscruple the happiest of mortals.Mrs. Thorpe, with tears of joy, embraced her daughter, her son, hervisitor, and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath withsatisfaction. Her heart was overflowing with tenderness. It was ""dearJohn"" and ""dear Catherine"" at every word; ""dear Anne and dear Maria""must immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two ""dears"" atonce before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved childhad now well earned. John himself was no skulker in joy. He not onlybestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finestfellows in the world, but swore off many sentences in his praise.The letter, whence sprang all this felicity, was short, containinglittle more than this assurance of success; and every particular wasdeferred till James could write again. But for particulars Isabellacould well afford to wait. The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland'spromise; his honour was pledged to make everything easy; and by whatmeans their income was to be formed, whether landed property were tobe resigned, or funded money made over, was a matter in which herdisinterested spirit took no concern. She knew enough to feel secure ofan honourable and speedy establishment, and her imagination took a rapidflight over its attendant felicities. She saw herself at the end ofa few weeks, the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance atFullerton, the envy of every valued old friend in Putney, with acarriage at her command, a new name on her tickets, and a brilliantexhibition of hoop rings on her finger.When the contents of the letter were ascertained, John Thorpe, who hadonly waited its arrival to begin his journey to London, prepared to setoff. ""Well, Miss Morland,"" said he, on finding her alone in the parlour,""I am come to bid you good-bye."" Catherine wished him a good journey.Without appearing to hear her, he walked to the window, fidgeted about,hummed a tune, and seemed wholly self-occupied.""Shall not you be late at Devizes?"" said Catherine. He made no answer;but after a minute's silence burst out with, ""A famous good thing thismarrying scheme, upon my soul! A clever fancy of Morland's and Belle's.What do you think of it, Miss Morland? I say it is no bad notion.""""I am sure I think it a very good one.""""Do you? That's honest, by heavens! I am glad you are no enemy tomatrimony, however. Did you ever hear the old song 'Going to One WeddingBrings on Another?' I say, you will come to Belle's wedding, I hope.""""Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her, if possible.""""And then you know""--twisting himself about and forcing a foolishlaugh--""I say, then you know, we may try the truth of this same oldsong.""""May we? But I never sing. Well, I wish you a good journey. I dine withMiss Tilney today, and must now be going home.""""Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry. Who knows when we maybe together again? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of afortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me.""""Then why do you stay away so long?"" replied Catherine--finding that hewaited for an answer.""That is kind of you, however--kind and good-natured. I shall not forgetit in a hurry. But you have more good nature and all that, than anybodyliving, I believe. A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not onlygood nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then youhave such--upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you.""""Oh! dear, there are a great many people like me, I dare say, only agreat deal better. Good morning to you.""""But I say, Miss Morland, I shall come and pay my respects at Fullertonbefore it is long, if not disagreeable.""""Pray do. My father and mother will be very glad to see you.""""And I hope--I hope, Miss Morland, you will not be sorry to see me.""""Oh! dear, not at all. There are very few people I am sorry to see.Company is always cheerful.""""That is just my way of thinking. Give me but a little cheerful company,let me only have the company of the people I love, let me only be whereI like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say I. AndI am heartily glad to hear you say the same. But I have a notion, MissMorland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters.""""Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of. And as to mostmatters, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mindabout.""""By Jove, no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with whatdoes not concern me. My notion of things is simple enough. Let me onlyhave the girl I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, andwhat care I for all the rest? Fortune is nothing. I am sure of a goodincome of my own; and if she had not a penny, why, so much the better.""""Very true. I think like you there. If there is a good fortune on oneside, there can be no occasion for any on the other. No matter whichhas it, so that there is enough. I hate the idea of one great fortunelooking out for another. And to marry for money I think the wickedestthing in existence. Good day. We shall be very glad to see you atFullerton, whenever it is convenient."" And away she went. It was not inthe power of all his gallantry to detain her longer. With such news tocommunicate, and such a visit to prepare for, her departure was notto be delayed by anything in his nature to urge; and she hurried away,leaving him to the undivided consciousness of his own happy address, andher explicit encouragement.The agitation which she had herself experienced on first learning herbrother's engagement made her expect to raise no inconsiderable emotionin Mr. and Mrs. Allen, by the communication of the wonderful event. Howgreat was her disappointment! The important affair, which many words ofpreparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever sinceher brother's arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion wascomprehended in a wish for the young people's happiness, with a remark,on the gentleman's side, in favour of Isabella's beauty, and on thelady's, of her great good luck. It was to Catherine the most surprisinginsensibility. The disclosure, however, of the great secret of James'sgoing to Fullerton the day before, did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen.She could not listen to that with perfect calmness, but repeatedlyregretted the necessity of its concealment, wished she could have knownhis intention, wished she could have seen him before he went, as sheshould certainly have troubled him with her best regards to his fatherand mother, and her kind compliments to all the Skinners."
Northanger Abbey,16,"CHAPTER 16Catherine's expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Streetwere so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly,though she was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindlywelcomed by his daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else ofthe party, she found, on her return, without spending many hours inthe examination of her feelings, that she had gone to her appointmentpreparing for happiness which it had not afforded. Instead of findingherself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourseof the day, she seemed hardly so intimate with her as before; insteadof seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of afamily party, he had never said so little, nor been so little agreeable;and, in spite of their father's great civilities to her--in spite of histhanks, invitations, and compliments--it had been a release to getaway from him. It puzzled her to account for all this. It could notbe General Tilney's fault. That he was perfectly agreeable andgood-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of adoubt, for he was tall and handsome, and Henry's father. He could notbe accountable for his children's want of spirits, or for her want ofenjoyment in his company. The former she hoped at last might havebeen accidental, and the latter she could only attribute to her ownstupidity. Isabella, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gavea different explanation: ""It was all pride, pride, insufferablehaughtiness and pride! She had long suspected the family to be veryhigh, and this made it certain. Such insolence of behaviour as MissTilney's she had never heard of in her life! Not to do the honours ofher house with common good breeding! To behave to her guest with suchsuperciliousness! Hardly even to speak to her!""""But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no superciliousness;she was very civil.""""Oh! Don't defend her! And then the brother, he, who had appearedso attached to you! Good heavens! Well, some people's feelings areincomprehensible. And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day?""""I do not say so; but he did not seem in good spirits.""""How contemptible! Of all things in the world inconstancy is myaversion. Let me entreat you never to think of him again, my dearCatherine; indeed he is unworthy of you.""""Unworthy! I do not suppose he ever thinks of me.""""That is exactly what I say; he never thinks of you. Such fickleness!Oh! How different to your brother and to mine! I really believe John hasthe most constant heart.""""But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be impossible foranybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention; it seemedto be his only care to entertain and make me happy.""""Oh! I know no harm of him; I do not suspect him of pride. I believe heis a very gentleman-like man. John thinks very well of him, and John'sjudgment--""""Well, I shall see how they behave to me this evening; we shall meetthem at the rooms.""""And must I go?""""Do not you intend it? I thought it was all settled.""""Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse you nothing. Butdo not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know, willbe some forty miles off. And as for dancing, do not mention it, I beg;that is quite out of the question. Charles Hodges will plague me todeath, I dare say; but I shall cut him very short. Ten to one but heguesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I shallinsist on his keeping his conjecture to himself.""Isabella's opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend; she wassure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother orsister; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts.The evening rewarded her confidence; she was met by one with the samekindness, and by the other with the same attention, as heretofore: MissTilney took pains to be near her, and Henry asked her to dance.Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother,Captain Tilney, was expected almost every hour, she was at no loss forthe name of a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom she hadnever seen before, and who now evidently belonged to their party. Shelooked at him with great admiration, and even supposed it possible thatsome people might think him handsomer than his brother, though, in hereyes, his air was more assuming, and his countenance less prepossessing.His taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior; for,within her hearing, he not only protested against every thought ofdancing himself, but even laughed openly at Henry for finding itpossible. From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that, whatevermight be our heroine's opinion of him, his admiration of her was notof a very dangerous kind; not likely to produce animosities between thebrothers, nor persecutions to the lady. He cannot be the instigator ofthe three villains in horsemen's greatcoats, by whom she will hereafterbe forced into a traveling-chaise and four, which will drive off withincredible speed. Catherine, meanwhile, undisturbed by presentiments ofsuch an evil, or of any evil at all, except that of having but a shortset to dance down, enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney,listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said; and, in finding himirresistible, becoming so herself.At the end of the first dance, Captain Tilney came towards them again,and, much to Catherine's dissatisfaction, pulled his brother away. Theyretired whispering together; and, though her delicate sensibility didnot take immediate alarm, and lay it down as fact, that Captain Tilneymust have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her, which he nowhastened to communicate to his brother, in the hope of separating themforever, she could not have her partner conveyed from her sight withoutvery uneasy sensations. Her suspense was of full five minutes' duration;and she was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour, whenthey both returned, and an explanation was given, by Henry's requestingto know if she thought her friend, Miss Thorpe, would have any objectionto dancing, as his brother would be most happy to be introduced toher. Catherine, without hesitation, replied that she was very sure MissThorpe did not mean to dance at all. The cruel reply was passed on tothe other, and he immediately walked away.""Your brother will not mind it, I know,"" said she, ""because I heard himsay before that he hated dancing; but it was very good-natured in himto think of it. I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied shemight wish for a partner; but he is quite mistaken, for she would notdance upon any account in the world.""Henry smiled, and said, ""How very little trouble it can give you tounderstand the motive of other people's actions.""""Why? What do you mean?""""With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be influenced, Whatis the inducement most likely to act upon such a person's feelings, age,situation, and probable habits of life considered--but, How should I beinfluenced, What would be my inducement in acting so and so?""""I do not understand you.""""Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand you perfectlywell.""""Me? Yes; I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.""""Bravo! An excellent satire on modern language.""""But pray tell me what you mean.""""Shall I indeed? Do you really desire it? But you are not aware of theconsequences; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment, andcertainly bring on a disagreement between us.""""No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid.""""Well, then, I only meant that your attributing my brother's wish ofdancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your beingsuperior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world.""Catherine blushed and disclaimed, and the gentleman's predictions wereverified. There was a something, however, in his words which repaid herfor the pain of confusion; and that something occupied her mind so muchthat she drew back for some time, forgetting to speak or to listen, andalmost forgetting where she was; till, roused by the voice of Isabella,she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give themhands across.Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled, the only explanation of thisextraordinary change which could at that time be given; but as itwas not quite enough for Catherine's comprehension, she spoke herastonishment in very plain terms to her partner.""I cannot think how it could happen! Isabella was so determined not todance.""""And did Isabella never change her mind before?""""Oh! But, because--And your brother! After what you told him from me,how could he think of going to ask her?""""I cannot take surprise to myself on that head. You bid me be surprisedon your friend's account, and therefore I am; but as for my brother, hisconduct in the business, I must own, has been no more than I believedhim perfectly equal to. The fairness of your friend was an openattraction; her firmness, you know, could only be understood byyourself.""""You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in general.""""It is as much as should be said of anyone. To be always firm must beto be often obstinate. When properly to relax is the trial of judgment;and, without reference to my brother, I really think Miss Thorpe has byno means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour.""The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discoursetill all the dancing was over; but then, as they walked about the roomarm in arm, Isabella thus explained herself: ""I do not wonder at yoursurprise; and I am really fatigued to death. He is such a rattle!Amusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged; but I would have giventhe world to sit still.""""Then why did not you?""""Oh! My dear! It would have looked so particular; and you know how Iabhor doing that. I refused him as long as I possibly could, but hewould take no denial. You have no idea how he pressed me. I begged himto excuse me, and get some other partner--but no, not he; after aspiringto my hand, there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of;and it was not that he wanted merely to dance, he wanted to be withme. Oh! Such nonsense! I told him he had taken a very unlikely way toprevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speechesand compliments; and so--and so then I found there would be no peace ifI did not stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him,might take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure hewould have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening. I amso glad it is over! My spirits are quite jaded with listening to hisnonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye wasupon us.""""He is very handsome indeed.""""Handsome! Yes, I suppose he may. I dare say people would admire himin general; but he is not at all in my style of beauty. I hate a floridcomplexion and dark eyes in a man. However, he is very well. Amazinglyconceited, I am sure. I took him down several times, you know, in myway.""When the young ladies next met, they had a far more interesting subjectto discuss. James Morland's second letter was then received, and thekind intentions of his father fully explained. A living, of which Mr.Morland was himself patron and incumbent, of about four hundred poundsyearly value, was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should beold enough to take it; no trifling deduction from the family income, noniggardly assignment to one of ten children. An estate of at least equalvalue, moreover, was assured as his future inheritance.James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude; andthe necessity of waiting between two and three years before they couldmarry, being, however unwelcome, no more than he had expected, was borneby him without discontent. Catherine, whose expectations had been asunfixed as her ideas of her father's income, and whose judgment was nowentirely led by her brother, felt equally well satisfied, and heartilycongratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled.""It is very charming indeed,"" said Isabella, with a grave face. ""Mr.Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed,"" said the gentle Mrs.Thorpe, looking anxiously at her daughter. ""I only wish I could do asmuch. One could not expect more from him, you know. If he finds hecan do more by and by, I dare say he will, for I am sure he must be anexcellent good-hearted man. Four hundred is but a small income to beginon indeed, but your wishes, my dear Isabella, are so moderate, you donot consider how little you ever want, my dear.""""It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I cannot bear tobe the means of injuring my dear Morland, making him sit down upon anincome hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life. Formyself, it is nothing; I never think of myself.""""I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward inthe affection it makes everybody feel for you. There never was a youngwoman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare saywhen Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child--but do not let us distressour dear Catherine by talking of such things. Mr. Morland has behaved sovery handsome, you know. I always heard he was a most excellent man;and you know, my dear, we are not to suppose but what, if you had had asuitable fortune, he would have come down with something more, for I amsure he must be a most liberal-minded man.""""Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do, I am sure. Buteverybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right todo what they like with their own money."" Catherine was hurt by theseinsinuations. ""I am very sure,"" said she, ""that my father has promisedto do as much as he can afford.""Isabella recollected herself. ""As to that, my sweet Catherine, therecannot be a doubt, and you know me well enough to be sure that a muchsmaller income would satisfy me. It is not the want of more money thatmakes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and ifour union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I shouldnot have a wish unsatisfied. Ah! my Catherine, you have found me out.There's the sting. The long, long, endless two years and half that areto pass before your brother can hold the living.""""Yes, yes, my darling Isabella,"" said Mrs. Thorpe, ""we perfectly seeinto your heart. You have no disguise. We perfectly understand thepresent vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such anoble honest affection.""Catherine's uncomfortable feelings began to lessen. She endeavoured tobelieve that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella'sregret; and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful andamiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thoughtotherwise. James soon followed his letter, and was received with themost gratifying kindness."
Northanger Abbey,17,"CHAPTER 17The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath; andwhether it should be the last was for some time a question, to whichCatherine listened with a beating heart. To have her acquaintance withthe Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance.Her whole happiness seemed at stake, while the affair was in suspense,and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings shouldbe taken for another fortnight. What this additional fortnight was toproduce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney madebut a small part of Catherine's speculation. Once or twice indeed, sinceJames's engagement had taught her what could be done, she had got sofar as to indulge in a secret ""perhaps,"" but in general the felicity ofbeing with him for the present bounded her views: the present was nowcomprised in another three weeks, and her happiness being certain forthat period, the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excitebut little interest. In the course of the morning which saw thisbusiness arranged, she visited Miss Tilney, and poured forth herjoyful feelings. It was doomed to be a day of trial. No sooner had sheexpressed her delight in Mr. Allen's lengthened stay than Miss Tilneytold her of her father's having just determined upon quitting Bathby the end of another week. Here was a blow! The past suspense ofthe morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment.Catherine's countenance fell, and in a voice of most sincere concern sheechoed Miss Tilney's concluding words, ""By the end of another week!""""Yes, my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what Ithink a fair trial. He has been disappointed of some friends' arrivalwhom he expected to meet here, and as he is now pretty well, is in ahurry to get home.""""I am very sorry for it,"" said Catherine dejectedly; ""if I had knownthis before--""""Perhaps,"" said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner, ""you would be sogood--it would make me very happy if--""The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility, which Catherinewas beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding.After addressing her with his usual politeness, he turned to hisdaughter and said, ""Well, Eleanor, may I congratulate you on beingsuccessful in your application to your fair friend?""""I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in.""""Well, proceed by all means. I know how much your heart is in it. Mydaughter, Miss Morland,"" he continued, without leaving his daughter timeto speak, ""has been forming a very bold wish. We leave Bath, as she hasperhaps told you, on Saturday se'nnight. A letter from my steward tellsme that my presence is wanted at home; and being disappointed in my hopeof seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here, some ofmy very old friends, there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath. Andcould we carry our selfish point with you, we should leave it without asingle regret. Can you, in short, be prevailed on to quit this sceneof public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company inGloucestershire? I am almost ashamed to make the request, though itspresumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Baththan yourself. Modesty such as yours--but not for the world would I painit by open praise. If you can be induced to honour us with a visit,you will make us happy beyond expression. 'Tis true, we can offer younothing like the gaieties of this lively place; we can tempt you neitherby amusement nor splendour, for our mode of living, as you see, is plainand unpretending; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to makeNorthanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable.""Northanger Abbey! These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine'sfeelings to the highest point of ecstasy. Her grateful and gratifiedheart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language oftolerable calmness. To receive so flattering an invitation! To have hercompany so warmly solicited! Everything honourable and soothing, everypresent enjoyment, and every future hope was contained in it; and heracceptance, with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma's approbation,was eagerly given. ""I will write home directly,"" said she, ""and if theydo not object, as I dare say they will not--""General Tilney was not less sanguine, having already waited on herexcellent friends in Pulteney Street, and obtained their sanction ofhis wishes. ""Since they can consent to part with you,"" said he, ""we mayexpect philosophy from all the world.""Miss Tilney was earnest, though gentle, in her secondary civilities, andthe affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessaryreference to Fullerton would allow.The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine's feelings throughthe varieties of suspense, security, and disappointment; but they werenow safely lodged in perfect bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture,with Henry at her heart, and Northanger Abbey on her lips, shehurried home to write her letter. Mr. and Mrs. Morland, relying onthe discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted theirdaughter, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which hadbeen formed under their eye, and sent therefore by return of post theirready consent to her visit in Gloucestershire. This indulgence, thoughnot more than Catherine had hoped for, completed her conviction of beingfavoured beyond every other human creature, in friends and fortune,circumstance and chance. Everything seemed to cooperate for heradvantage. By the kindness of her first friends, the Allens, she hadbeen introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her.Her feelings, her preferences, had each known the happiness of a return.Wherever she felt attachment, she had been able to create it. Theaffection of Isabella was to be secured to her in a sister. The Tilneys,they, by whom, above all, she desired to be favourably thought of,outstripped even her wishes in the flattering measures by which theirintimacy was to be continued. She was to be their chosen visitor, shewas to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose societyshe mostly prized--and, in addition to all the rest, this roof was tobe the roof of an abbey! Her passion for ancient edifices was next indegree to her passion for Henry Tilney--and castles and abbeys madeusually the charm of those reveries which his image did not fill. To seeand explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the cloistersof the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though to be morethan the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire.And yet, this was to happen. With all the chances against her of house,hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned up an abbey,and she was to be its inhabitant. Its long, damp passages, its narrowcells and ruined chapel, were to be within her daily reach, and shecould not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends, someawful memorials of an injured and ill-fated nun.It was wonderful that her friends should seem so little elated by thepossession of such a home, that the consciousness of it should be someekly borne. The power of early habit only could account for it. Adistinction to which they had been born gave no pride. Their superiorityof abode was no more to them than their superiority of person.Many were the inquiries she was eager to make of Miss Tilney; but soactive were her thoughts, that when these inquiries were answered, shewas hardly more assured than before, of Northanger Abbey having beena richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation, of its havingfallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution,of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of thepresent dwelling although the rest was decayed, or of its standing lowin a valley, sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak."
Northanger Abbey,18,"CHAPTER 18With a mind thus full of happiness, Catherine was hardly aware that twoor three days had passed away, without her seeing Isabella for more thana few minutes together. She began first to be sensible of this, andto sigh for her conversation, as she walked along the pump-room onemorning, by Mrs. Allen's side, without anything to say or to hear; andscarcely had she felt a five minutes' longing of friendship, before theobject of it appeared, and inviting her to a secret conference, led theway to a seat. ""This is my favourite place,"" said she as they satdown on a bench between the doors, which commanded a tolerable view ofeverybody entering at either; ""it is so out of the way.""Catherine, observing that Isabella's eyes were continually bent towardsone door or the other, as in eager expectation, and remembering howoften she had been falsely accused of being arch, thought the present afine opportunity for being really so; and therefore gaily said, ""Do notbe uneasy, Isabella, James will soon be here.""""Psha! My dear creature,"" she replied, ""do not think me such a simpletonas to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow. It would be hideousto be always together; we should be the jest of the place. And so youare going to Northanger! I am amazingly glad of it. It is one of thefinest old places in England, I understand. I shall depend upon a mostparticular description of it.""""You shall certainly have the best in my power to give. But who are youlooking for? Are your sisters coming?""""I am not looking for anybody. One's eyes must be somewhere, and youknow what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine, when my thoughts are anhundred miles off. I am amazingly absent; I believe I am the most absentcreature in the world. Tilney says it is always the case with minds of acertain stamp.""""But I thought, Isabella, you had something in particular to tell me?""""Oh! Yes, and so I have. But here is a proof of what I was saying. Mypoor head, I had quite forgot it. Well, the thing is this: I have justhad a letter from John; you can guess the contents.""""No, indeed, I cannot.""""My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected. What can he writeabout, but yourself? You know he is over head and ears in love withyou.""""With me, dear Isabella!""""Nay, my sweetest Catherine, this is being quite absurd! Modesty, andall that, is very well in its way, but really a little common honesty issometimes quite as becoming. I have no idea of being so overstrained!It is fishing for compliments. His attentions were such as a child musthave noticed. And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that yougave him the most positive encouragement. He says so in this letter,says that he as good as made you an offer, and that you received hisadvances in the kindest way; and now he wants me to urge his suit,and say all manner of pretty things to you. So it is in vain to affectignorance.""Catherine, with all the earnestness of truth, expressed her astonishmentat such a charge, protesting her innocence of every thought of Mr.Thorpe's being in love with her, and the consequent impossibility ofher having ever intended to encourage him. ""As to any attentions on hisside, I do declare, upon my honour, I never was sensible of them for amoment--except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming.And as to making me an offer, or anything like it, there must be someunaccountable mistake. I could not have misunderstood a thing of thatkind, you know! And, as I ever wish to be believed, I solemnly protestthat no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us. The last halfhour before he went away! It must be all and completely a mistake--for Idid not see him once that whole morning.""""But that you certainly did, for you spent the whole morning in Edgar'sBuildings--it was the day your father's consent came--and I am prettysure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before youleft the house.""""Are you? Well, if you say it, it was so, I dare say--but for the lifeof me, I cannot recollect it. I do remember now being with you, andseeing him as well as the rest--but that we were ever alone for fiveminutes--However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might passon his side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it,that I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kindfrom him. I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard forme--but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never hadthe smallest idea of it. Pray undeceive him as soon as you can, and tellhim I beg his pardon--that is--I do not know what I ought to say--butmake him understand what I mean, in the properest way. I would not speakdisrespectfully of a brother of yours, Isabella, I am sure; but you knowvery well that if I could think of one man more than another--he is notthe person."" Isabella was silent. ""My dear friend, you must not be angrywith me. I cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me. And,you know, we shall still be sisters.""""Yes, yes"" (with a blush), ""there are more ways than one of our beingsisters. But where am I wandering to? Well, my dear Catherine, the caseseems to be that you are determined against poor John--is not it so?""""I certainly cannot return his affection, and as certainly never meantto encourage it.""""Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you any further.John desired me to speak to you on the subject, and therefore I have.But I confess, as soon as I read his letter, I thought it a veryfoolish, imprudent business, and not likely to promote the good ofeither; for what were you to live upon, supposing you came together? Youhave both of you something, to be sure, but it is not a trifle that willsupport a family nowadays; and after all that romancers may say, thereis no doing without money. I only wonder John could think of it; hecould not have received my last.""""You do acquit me, then, of anything wrong?--You are convinced that Inever meant to deceive your brother, never suspected him of liking metill this moment?""""Oh! As to that,"" answered Isabella laughingly, ""I do not pretend todetermine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been. Allthat is best known to yourself. A little harmless flirtation or so willoccur, and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than onewishes to stand by. But you may be assured that I am the last person inthe world to judge you severely. All those things should be allowed forin youth and high spirits. What one means one day, you know, one may notmean the next. Circumstances change, opinions alter.""""But my opinion of your brother never did alter; it was always the same.You are describing what never happened.""""My dearest Catherine,"" continued the other without at all listening toher, ""I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into anengagement before you knew what you were about. I do not think anythingwould justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merelyto oblige my brother, because he is my brother, and who perhaps afterall, you know, might be just as happy without you, for people seldomknow what they would be at, young men especially, they are so amazinglychangeable and inconstant. What I say is, why should a brother'shappiness be dearer to me than a friend's? You know I carry my notionsof friendship pretty high. But, above all things, my dear Catherine, donot be in a hurry. Take my word for it, that if you are in too greata hurry, you will certainly live to repent it. Tilney says there isnothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their ownaffections, and I believe he is very right. Ah! Here he comes; nevermind, he will not see us, I am sure.""Catherine, looking up, perceived Captain Tilney; and Isabella,earnestly fixing her eye on him as she spoke, soon caught his notice. Heapproached immediately, and took the seat to which her movements invitedhim. His first address made Catherine start. Though spoken low, shecould distinguish, ""What! Always to be watched, in person or by proxy!""""Psha, nonsense!"" was Isabella's answer in the same half whisper. ""Whydo you put such things into my head? If I could believe it--my spirit,you know, is pretty independent.""""I wish your heart were independent. That would be enough for me.""""My heart, indeed! What can you have to do with hearts? You men havenone of you any hearts.""""If we have not hearts, we have eyes; and they give us torment enough.""""Do they? I am sorry for it; I am sorry they find anything sodisagreeable in me. I will look another way. I hope this pleases you""(turning her back on him); ""I hope your eyes are not tormented now.""""Never more so; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view--atonce too much and too little.""Catherine heard all this, and quite out of countenance, could listenno longer. Amazed that Isabella could endure it, and jealous for herbrother, she rose up, and saying she should join Mrs. Allen, proposedtheir walking. But for this Isabella showed no inclination. She was soamazingly tired, and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room;and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters; she wasexpecting her sisters every moment; so that her dearest Catherine mustexcuse her, and must sit quietly down again. But Catherine could bestubborn too; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose theirreturning home, she joined her and walked out of the pump-room, leavingIsabella still sitting with Captain Tilney. With much uneasiness didshe thus leave them. It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was fallingin love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him;unconsciously it must be, for Isabella's attachment to James was ascertain and well acknowledged as her engagement. To doubt her truthor good intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of theirconversation her manner had been odd. She wished Isabella had talkedmore like her usual self, and not so much about money, and had notlooked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney. How strange thatshe should not perceive his admiration! Catherine longed to give her ahint of it, to put her on her guard, and prevent all the pain whichher too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and herbrother.The compliment of John Thorpe's affection did not make amends for thisthoughtlessness in his sister. She was almost as far from believing asfrom wishing it to be sincere; for she had not forgotten that hecould mistake, and his assertion of the offer and of her encouragementconvinced her that his mistakes could sometimes be very egregious.In vanity, therefore, she gained but little; her chief profit was inwonder. That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in lovewith her was a matter of lively astonishment. Isabella talked of hisattentions; she had never been sensible of any; but Isabella had saidmany things which she hoped had been spoken in haste, and would neverbe said again; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for presentease and comfort."
Northanger Abbey,19,"CHAPTER 19A few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing herself tosuspect her friend, could not help watching her closely. The result ofher observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered creature.When she saw her, indeed, surrounded only by their immediate friendsin Edgar's Buildings or Pulteney Street, her change of manners was sotrifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed unnoticed.A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted absence ofmind which Catherine had never heard of before, would occasionally comeacross her; but had nothing worse appeared, that might only have spreada new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But when Catherine saw herin public, admitting Captain Tilney's attentions as readily as they wereoffered, and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her noticeand smiles, the alteration became too positive to be passed over. Whatcould be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend could be at,was beyond her comprehension. Isabella could not be aware of the painshe was inflicting; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness whichCatherine could not but resent. James was the sufferer. She saw himgrave and uneasy; and however careless of his present comfort the womanmight be who had given him her heart, to her it was always an object.For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned. Though his looksdid not please her, his name was a passport to her goodwill, and shethought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment; for,in spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump-room,his behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella'sengagement that she could not, upon reflection, imagine him aware of it.He might be jealous of her brother as a rival, but if more had seemedimplied, the fault must have been in her misapprehension. She wished, bya gentle remonstrance, to remind Isabella of her situation, and makeher aware of this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, eitheropportunity or comprehension was always against her. If able to suggesta hint, Isabella could never understand it. In this distress, theintended departure of the Tilney family became her chief consolation;their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days,and Captain Tilney's removal would at least restore peace to every heartbut his own. But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing;he was not to be of the party to Northanger; he was to continue at Bath.When Catherine knew this, her resolution was directly made. She spoke toHenry Tilney on the subject, regretting his brother's evident partialityfor Miss Thorpe, and entreating him to make known her prior engagement.""My brother does know it,"" was Henry's answer.""Does he? Then why does he stay here?""He made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but sheeagerly continued, ""Why do not you persuade him to go away? The longerhe stays, the worse it will be for him at last. Pray advise him for hisown sake, and for everybody's sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence willin time make him comfortable again; but he can have no hope here, and itis only staying to be miserable.""Henry smiled and said, ""I am sure my brother would not wish to do that.""""Then you will persuade him to go away?""""Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I cannot even endeavourto persuade him. I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged. Heknows what he is about, and must be his own master.""""No, he does not know what he is about,"" cried Catherine; ""he does notknow the pain he is giving my brother. Not that James has ever told meso, but I am sure he is very uncomfortable.""""And are you sure it is my brother's doing?""""Yes, very sure.""""Is it my brother's attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe'sadmission of them, that gives the pain?""""Is not it the same thing?""""I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference. No man is offendedby another man's admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman onlywho can make it a torment.""Catherine blushed for her friend, and said, ""Isabella is wrong. But Iam sure she cannot mean to torment, for she is very much attached to mybrother. She has been in love with him ever since they first met, andwhile my father's consent was uncertain, she fretted herself almost intoa fever. You know she must be attached to him.""""I understand: she is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick.""""Oh! no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man cannot flirt withanother.""""It is probable that she will neither love so well, nor flirt sowell, as she might do either singly. The gentlemen must each give up alittle.""After a short pause, Catherine resumed with, ""Then you do not believeIsabella so very much attached to my brother?""""I can have no opinion on that subject.""""But what can your brother mean? If he knows her engagement, what can hemean by his behaviour?""""You are a very close questioner.""""Am I? I only ask what I want to be told.""""But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?""""Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother's heart.""""My brother's heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assureyou I can only guess at.""""Well?""""Well! Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for ourselves. Tobe guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful. The premises are beforeyou. My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless youngman; he has had about a week's acquaintance with your friend, and he hasknown her engagement almost as long as he has known her.""""Well,"" said Catherine, after some moments' consideration, ""you may beable to guess at your brother's intentions from all this; but I am sureI cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not hewant Captain Tilney to go away? Sure, if your father were to speak tohim, he would go.""""My dear Miss Morland,"" said Henry, ""in this amiable solicitude for yourbrother's comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not carrieda little too far? Would he thank you, either on his own account orMiss Thorpe's, for supposing that her affection, or at least her goodbehaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of CaptainTilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to himonly when unsolicited by anyone else? He cannot think this--and you maybe sure that he would not have you think it. I will not say, 'Do notbe uneasy,' because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be aslittle uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachmentof your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, thatreal jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that nodisagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are opento each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly whatis required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one willnever tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.""Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave, he added, ""ThoughFrederick does not leave Bath with us, he will probably remain but avery short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. His leave of absencewill soon expire, and he must return to his regiment. And what will thenbe their acquaintance? The mess-room will drink Isabella Thorpe fora fortnight, and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney'spassion for a month.""Catherine would contend no longer against comfort. She had resisted itsapproaches during the whole length of a speech, but it now carried hercaptive. Henry Tilney must know best. She blamed herself for the extentof her fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subjectagain.Her resolution was supported by Isabella's behaviour in their partinginterview. The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine's stay inPulteney Street, and nothing passed between the lovers to exciteher uneasiness, or make her quit them in apprehension. James was inexcellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly placid. Her tendernessfor her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart; but thatat such a moment was allowable; and once she gave her lover a flatcontradiction, and once she drew back her hand; but Catherine rememberedHenry's instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection. Theembraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied."
Northanger Abbey,20,"CHAPTER 20Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend, whose goodhumour and cheerfulness had made her a valuable companion, and in thepromotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased. Herhappiness in going with Miss Tilney, however, prevented their wishingit otherwise; and, as they were to remain only one more week in Baththemselves, her quitting them now would not long be felt. Mr. Allenattended her to Milsom Street, where she was to breakfast, and saw herseated with the kindest welcome among her new friends; but so great washer agitation in finding herself as one of the family, and so fearfulwas she of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able topreserve their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the firstfive minutes, she could almost have wished to return with him toPulteney Street.Miss Tilney's manners and Henry's smile soon did away some of herunpleasant feelings; but still she was far from being at ease; nor couldthe incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure her.Nay, perverse as it seemed, she doubted whether she might not have feltless, had she been less attended to. His anxiety for her comfort--hiscontinual solicitations that she would eat, and his often-expressedfears of her seeing nothing to her taste--though never in her lifebefore had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table--made itimpossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor. Shefelt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew not how to reply to it.Her tranquillity was not improved by the general's impatience for theappearance of his eldest son, nor by the displeasure he expressed at hislaziness when Captain Tilney at last came down. She was quite pained bythe severity of his father's reproof, which seemed disproportionate tothe offence; and much was her concern increased when she found herselfthe principal cause of the lecture, and that his tardiness was chieflyresented from being disrespectful to her. This was placing her in avery uncomfortable situation, and she felt great compassion for CaptainTilney, without being able to hope for his goodwill.He listened to his father in silence, and attempted not any defence,which confirmed her in fearing that the inquietude of his mind, onIsabella's account, might, by keeping him long sleepless, have beenthe real cause of his rising late. It was the first time of her beingdecidedly in his company, and she had hoped to be now able to formher opinion of him; but she scarcely heard his voice while his fatherremained in the room; and even afterwards, so much were his spiritsaffected, she could distinguish nothing but these words, in a whisper toEleanor, ""How glad I shall be when you are all off.""The bustle of going was not pleasant. The clock struck ten while thetrunks were carrying down, and the general had fixed to be out of MilsomStreet by that hour. His greatcoat, instead of being brought for himto put on directly, was spread out in the curricle in which he was toaccompany his son. The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out,though there were three people to go in it, and his daughter's maid hadso crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit;and, so much was he influenced by this apprehension when he handed herin, that she had some difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk frombeing thrown out into the street. At last, however, the door was closedupon the three females, and they set off at the sober pace in whichthe handsome, highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform ajourney of thirty miles: such was the distance of Northanger from Bath,to be now divided into two equal stages. Catherine's spirits revived asthey drove from the door; for with Miss Tilney she felt no restraint;and, with the interest of a road entirely new to her, of an abbeybefore, and a curricle behind, she caught the last view of Bath withoutany regret, and met with every milestone before she expected it. Thetediousness of a two hours' wait at Petty France, in which there wasnothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and loiter aboutwithout anything to see, next followed--and her admiration of the stylein which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and four--postilionshandsomely liveried, rising so regularly in their stirrups, andnumerous outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under this consequentinconvenience. Had their party been perfectly agreeable, the delay wouldhave been nothing; but General Tilney, though so charming a man, seemedalways a check upon his children's spirits, and scarcely anything wassaid but by himself; the observation of which, with his discontent atwhatever the inn afforded, and his angry impatience at the waiters, madeCatherine grow every moment more in awe of him, and appeared to lengthenthe two hours into four. At last, however, the order of release wasgiven; and much was Catherine then surprised by the general's proposalof her taking his place in his son's curricle for the rest of thejourney: ""the day was fine, and he was anxious for her seeing as much ofthe country as possible.""The remembrance of Mr. Allen's opinion, respecting young men's opencarriages, made her blush at the mention of such a plan, and her firstthought was to decline it; but her second was of greater deference forGeneral Tilney's judgment; he could not propose anything improper forher; and, in the course of a few minutes, she found herself with Henryin the curricle, as happy a being as ever existed. A very short trialconvinced her that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world;the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur, to be sure, but itwas a heavy and troublesome business, and she could not easily forgetits having stopped two hours at Petty France. Half the time wouldhave been enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horsesdisposed to move, that, had not the general chosen to have his owncarriage lead the way, they could have passed it with ease in half aminute. But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses;Henry drove so well--so quietly--without making any disturbance,without parading to her, or swearing at them: so different from the onlygentleman-coachman whom it was in her power to compare him with! Andthen his hat sat so well, and the innumerable capes of his greatcoatlooked so becomingly important! To be driven by him, next to beingdancing with him, was certainly the greatest happiness in the world. Inaddition to every other delight, she had now that of listening to herown praise; of being thanked at least, on his sister's account, forher kindness in thus becoming her visitor; of hearing it ranked as realfriendship, and described as creating real gratitude. His sister, hesaid, was uncomfortably circumstanced--she had no female companion--and,in the frequent absence of her father, was sometimes without anycompanion at all.""But how can that be?"" said Catherine. ""Are not you with her?""""Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment atmy own house in Woodston, which is nearly twenty miles from my father's,and some of my time is necessarily spent there.""""How sorry you must be for that!""""I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.""""Yes; but besides your affection for her, you must be so fond ofthe abbey! After being used to such a home as the abbey, an ordinaryparsonage-house must be very disagreeable.""He smiled, and said, ""You have formed a very favourable idea of theabbey.""""To be sure, I have. Is not it a fine old place, just like what onereads about?""""And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building suchas 'what one reads about' may produce? Have you a stout heart? Nervesfit for sliding panels and tapestry?""""Oh! yes--I do not think I should be easily frightened, because therewould be so many people in the house--and besides, it has never beenuninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come backto it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.""""No, certainly. We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimlylighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire--nor be obliged to spreadour beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture.But you must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever means)introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart fromthe rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of thehouse, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, upa different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartmentnever used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty yearsbefore. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mindmisgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber--too lofty andextensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to takein its size--its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large aslife, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting evena funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?""""Oh! But this will not happen to me, I am sure.""""How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! Andwhat will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers,but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other aponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplacethe portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will soincomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw youreyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance,gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints.To raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose thatthe part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informsyou that you will not have a single domestic within call. With thisparting cordial she curtsies off--you listen to the sound of herreceding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you--and when,with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover,with increased alarm, that it has no lock.""""Oh! Mr. Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannotreally happen to me. I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy.Well, what then?""""Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. Aftersurmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed, you will retire torest, and get a few hours' unquiet slumber. But on the second, or atfarthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have aviolent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edificeto its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains--and duringthe frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably thinkyou discern (for your lamp is not extinguished) one part of the hangingmore violently agitated than the rest. Unable of course to repress yourcuriosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantlyarise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examinethis mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division inthe tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection,and on opening it, a door will immediately appear--which door, beingonly secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts,succeed in opening--and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass throughit into a small vaulted room.""""No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.""""What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is asecret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapelof St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so simplean adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted room,and through this into several others, without perceiving anything veryremarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in anothera few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument oftorture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way,and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your ownapartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, youreyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebonyand gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, youhad passed unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you willeagerly advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search intoevery drawer--but for some time without discovering anything ofimportance--perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. Atlast, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment willopen--a roll of paper appears--you seize it--it contains many sheets ofmanuscript--you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber,but scarcely have you been able to decipher 'Oh! Thou--whomsoever thoumayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda mayfall'--when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you intotal darkness.""""Oh! No, no--do not say so. Well, go on.""But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be ableto carry it farther; he could no longer command solemnity either ofsubject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancyin the perusal of Matilda's woes. Catherine, recollecting herself, grewashamed of her eagerness, and began earnestly to assure him that herattention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of reallymeeting with what he related. ""Miss Tilney, she was sure, would neverput her into such a chamber as he had described! She was not at allafraid.""As they drew near the end of their journey, her impatience for a sightof the abbey--for some time suspended by his conversation on subjectsvery different--returned in full force, and every bend in the road wasexpected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of greystone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of thesun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows. But solow did the building stand, that she found herself passing through thegreat gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger, withouthaving discerned even an antique chimney.She knew not that she had any right to be surprised, but there was asomething in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected.To pass between lodges of a modern appearance, to find herself with suchease in the very precincts of the abbey, and driven so rapidly along asmooth, level road of fine gravel, without obstacle, alarm, or solemnityof any kind, struck her as odd and inconsistent. She was not longat leisure, however, for such considerations. A sudden scud of rain,driving full in her face, made it impossible for her to observe anythingfurther, and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of her new strawbonnet; and she was actually under the abbey walls, was springing, withHenry's assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the shelter of theold porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where her friend andthe general were waiting to welcome her, without feeling one awfulforeboding of future misery to herself, or one moment's suspicion of anypast scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice. The breezehad not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her; it had waftednothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a good shaketo her habit, she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room,and capable of considering where she was.An abbey! Yes, it was delightful to be really in an abbey! But shedoubted, as she looked round the room, whether anything within herobservation would have given her the consciousness. The furniture was inall the profusion and elegance of modern taste. The fireplace, where shehad expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times, wascontracted to a Rumford, with slabs of plain though handsome marble, andornaments over it of the prettiest English china. The windows, to whichshe looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the general talkof his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care, wereyet less what her fancy had portrayed. To be sure, the pointed archwas preserved--the form of them was Gothic--they might be evencasements--but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! To animagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heavieststone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the difference wasvery distressing.The general, perceiving how her eye was employed, began to talk of thesmallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture, where everything,being for daily use, pretended only to comfort, etc.; flatteringhimself, however, that there were some apartments in the Abbey notunworthy her notice--and was proceeding to mention the costly gildingof one in particular, when, taking out his watch, he stopped short topronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five! This seemedthe word of separation, and Catherine found herself hurried away by MissTilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctualityto the family hours would be expected at Northanger.Returning through the large and lofty hall, they ascended a broadstaircase of shining oak, which, after many flights and manylanding-places, brought them upon a long, wide gallery. On one side ithad a range of doors, and it was lighted on the other by windows whichCatherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle, beforeMiss Tilney led the way into a chamber, and scarcely staying to hope shewould find it comfortable, left her with an anxious entreaty that shewould make as little alteration as possible in her dress."
Northanger Abbey,21,"CHAPTER 21A moment's glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her apartmentwas very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her by thedescription of. It was by no means unreasonably large, and containedneither tapestry nor velvet. The walls were papered, the floor wascarpeted; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than thoseof the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not of the latestfashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the roomaltogether far from uncheerful. Her heart instantaneously at ease onthis point, she resolved to lose no time in particular examination ofanything, as she greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay.Her habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste, and she waspreparing to unpin the linen package, which the chaise-seat had conveyedfor her immediate accommodation, when her eye suddenly fell on a largehigh chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace.The sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything else, shestood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossedher:""This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! Animmense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look intoit--cost me what it may, I will look into it--and directly too--bydaylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out."" She advanced andexamined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darkerwood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of thesame. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each endwere the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhapsprematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, wasa mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently,but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She couldnot, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to bea T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house wasa circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If notoriginally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into theTilney family?Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,with trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazardsto satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, forsomething seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few inches;but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her,starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. Thisill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be ofuse to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, itrecalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her,in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed inher dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick, for herthoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculatedto interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upona second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest. Atlength, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toiletteseemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity mightsafely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperateshould be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured bysupernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. Withthis spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence did not deceive her.Her resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyesthe view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at oneend of the chest in undisputed possession!She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney,anxious for her friend's being ready, entered the room, and to therising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation,was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search. ""That isa curious old chest, is not it?"" said Miss Tilney, as Catherine hastilyclosed it and turned away to the glass. ""It is impossible to say howmany generations it has been here. How it came to be first put in thisroom I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it mightsometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets. The worst of it is thatits weight makes it difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is atleast out of the way.""Catherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying hergown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch. MissTilney gently hinted her fear of being late; and in half a minute theyran downstairs together, in an alarm not wholly unfounded, for GeneralTilney was pacing the drawing-room, his watch in his hand, and having,on the very instant of their entering, pulled the bell with violence,ordered ""Dinner to be on table directly!""Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke, and sat paleand breathless, in a most humble mood, concerned for his children, anddetesting old chests; and the general, recovering his politeness as helooked at her, spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter forso foolishly hurrying her fair friend, who was absolutely out of breathfrom haste, when there was not the least occasion for hurry in theworld: but Catherine could not at all get over the double distressof having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpletonherself, till they were happily seated at the dinner-table, when thegeneral's complacent smiles, and a good appetite of her own, restoredher to peace. The dining-parlour was a noble room, suitable in itsdimensions to a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use, andfitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on theunpractised eye of Catherine, who saw little more than its spaciousnessand the number of their attendants. Of the former, she spoke aloudher admiration; and the general, with a very gracious countenance,acknowledged that it was by no means an ill-sized room, and furtherconfessed that, though as careless on such subjects as most people, hedid look upon a tolerably large eating-room as one of the necessariesof life; he supposed, however, ""that she must have been used to muchbetter-sized apartments at Mr. Allen's?""""No, indeed,"" was Catherine's honest assurance; ""Mr. Allen'sdining-parlour was not more than half as large,"" and she had neverseen so large a room as this in her life. The general's good humourincreased. Why, as he had such rooms, he thought it would be simple notto make use of them; but, upon his honour, he believed there might bemore comfort in rooms of only half their size. Mr. Allen's house, he wassure, must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness.The evening passed without any further disturbance, and, in theoccasional absence of General Tilney, with much positive cheerfulness.It was only in his presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatiguefrom her journey; and even then, even in moments of languor orrestraint, a sense of general happiness preponderated, and she couldthink of her friends in Bath without one wish of being with them.The night was stormy; the wind had been rising at intervals the wholeafternoon; and by the time the party broke up, it blew and rainedviolently. Catherine, as she crossed the hall, listened to the tempestwith sensations of awe; and, when she heard it rage round a corner ofthe ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, feltfor the first time that she was really in an abbey. Yes, these werecharacteristic sounds; they brought to her recollection a countlessvariety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildingshad witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did sherejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within wallsso solemn! She had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunkengallants. Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told herthat morning. In a house so furnished, and so guarded, she could havenothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to her bedroom as securelyas if it had been her own chamber at Fullerton. Thus wisely fortifyingher mind, as she proceeded upstairs, she was enabled, especially onperceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her, to enterher room with a tolerably stout heart; and her spirits were immediatelyassisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire. ""How much better isthis,"" said she, as she walked to the fender--""how much better to find afire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all thefamily are in bed, as so many poor girls have been obliged to do, andthen to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with afaggot! How glad I am that Northanger is what it is! If it had been likesome other places, I do not know that, in such a night as this, I couldhave answered for my courage: but now, to be sure, there is nothing toalarm one.""She looked round the room. The window curtains seemed in motion. Itcould be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through thedivisions of the shutters; and she stepped boldly forward, carelesslyhumming a tune, to assure herself of its being so, peeped courageouslybehind each curtain, saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her,and on placing a hand against the shutter, felt the strongest convictionof the wind's force. A glance at the old chest, as she turned away fromthis examination, was not without its use; she scorned the causelessfears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy indifference toprepare herself for bed. ""She should take her time; she should not hurryherself; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house.But she would not make up her fire; that would seem cowardly, as ifshe wished for the protection of light after she were in bed."" The firetherefore died away, and Catherine, having spent the best part of anhour in her arrangements, was beginning to think of stepping into bed,when, on giving a parting glance round the room, she was struck by theappearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though ina situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her notice before.Henry's words, his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escapeher observation at first, immediately rushed across her; and thoughthere could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, itwas certainly a very remarkable coincidence! She took her candle andlooked closely at the cabinet. It was not absolutely ebony and gold; butit was japan, black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind; and as sheheld her candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold. The keywas in the door, and she had a strange fancy to look into it; not,however, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it wasso very odd, after what Henry had said. In short, she could not sleeptill she had examined it. So, placing the candle with great caution ona chair, she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turnit; but it resisted her utmost strength. Alarmed, but not discouraged,she tried it another way; a bolt flew, and she believed herselfsuccessful; but how strangely mysterious! The door was still immovable.She paused a moment in breathless wonder. The wind roared down thechimney, the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and everythingseemed to speak the awfulness of her situation. To retire to bed,however, unsatisfied on such a point, would be vain, since sleep must beimpossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closedin her immediate vicinity. Again, therefore, she applied herself to thekey, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants withthe determined celerity of hope's last effort, the door suddenly yieldedto her hand: her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, andhaving thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only bybolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that hereye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawersappeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and inthe centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured inall probability a cavity of importance.Catherine's heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her. With acheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingersgrasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely empty.With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second, a third, afourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched, and in notone was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a treasure,the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her, andshe felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The place in themiddle alone remained now unexplored; and though she had ""never fromthe first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of thecabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thusfar, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she wasabout it."" It was some time however before she could unfasten the door,the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as ofthe outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was hersearch; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed backinto the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, andher feelings at that moment were indescribable. Her heart fluttered, herknees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale. She seized, with an unsteadyhand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertainwritten characters; and while she acknowledged with awful sensationsthis striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolvedinstantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest.The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it withalarm; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet somehours to burn; and that she might not have any greater difficulty indistinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion,she hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed and extinguished in one. Alamp could not have expired with more awful effect. Catherine, for afew moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not aremnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath.Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gustof wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment.Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, asound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struckon her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweatstood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and gropingher way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension ofagony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close her eyes insleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the question. Witha curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated,repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful!She had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blastseemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript so wonderfullyfound, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning's prediction, how was itto be accounted for? What could it contain? To whom could it relate?By what means could it have been so long concealed? And how singularlystrange that it should fall to her lot to discover it! Till she had madeherself mistress of its contents, however, she could have neither reposenor comfort; and with the sun's first rays she was determined to peruseit. But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene. Sheshuddered, tossed about in her bed, and envied every quiet sleeper. Thestorm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific eventhan the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The verycurtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at anotherthe lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody toenter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more thanonce her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour afterhour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimedby all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or sheunknowingly fell fast asleep."
Northanger Abbey,22,"CHAPTER 22The housemaid's folding back her window-shutters at eight o'clock thenext day was the sound which first roused Catherine; and she opened hereyes, wondering that they could ever have been closed, on objects ofcheerfulness; her fire was already burning, and a bright morninghad succeeded the tempest of the night. Instantaneously, with theconsciousness of existence, returned her recollection of the manuscript;and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid's going away,she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from theroll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the luxuryof their perusal on her pillow. She now plainly saw that she must notexpect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she hadshuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist entirely ofsmall disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling size, and muchless than she had supposed it to be at first.Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page. She started at its import.Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An inventoryof linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was beforeher! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-billin her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles withlittle variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothingnew. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each. Twoothers, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely moreinteresting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball.And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its firstcramp line, ""To poultice chestnut mare""--a farrier's bill! Such was thecollection of papers (left perhaps, as she could then suppose, by thenegligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them) whichhad filled her with expectation and alarm, and robbed her of half hernight's rest! She felt humbled to the dust. Could not the adventure ofthe chest have taught her wisdom? A corner of it, catching her eye asshe lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against her. Nothing could nowbe clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies. To suppose that amanuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered ina room such as that, so modern, so habitable!--Or that she should be thefirst to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet, the key of which wasopen to all!How could she have so imposed on herself? Heaven forbid that HenryTilney should ever know her folly! And it was in a great measure hisown doing, for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with hisdescription of her adventures, she should never have felt the smallestcuriosity about it. This was the only comfort that occurred. Impatientto get rid of those hateful evidences of her folly, those detestablepapers then scattered over the bed, she rose directly, and folding themup as nearly as possible in the same shape as before, returned themto the same spot within the cabinet, with a very hearty wish that nountoward accident might ever bring them forward again, to disgrace hereven with herself.Why the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was stillsomething remarkable, for she could now manage them with perfect ease.In this there was surely something mysterious, and she indulged in theflattering suggestion for half a minute, till the possibility of thedoor's having been at first unlocked, and of being herself its fastener,darted into her head, and cost her another blush.She got away as soon as she could from a room in which her conductproduced such unpleasant reflections, and found her way with all speedto the breakfast-parlour, as it had been pointed out to her by MissTilney the evening before. Henry was alone in it; and his immediate hopeof her having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch referenceto the character of the building they inhabited, was rather distressing.For the world would she not have her weakness suspected, and yet,unequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to acknowledge thatthe wind had kept her awake a little. ""But we have a charming morningafter it,"" she added, desiring to get rid of the subject; ""and stormsand sleeplessness are nothing when they are over. What beautifulhyacinths! I have just learnt to love a hyacinth.""""And how might you learn? By accident or argument?""""Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how. Mrs. Allen used to takepains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, tillI saw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferentabout flowers.""""But now you love a hyacinth. So much the better. You have gained a newsource of enjoyment, and it is well to have as many holds upon happinessas possible. Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable in yoursex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you to morefrequent exercise than you would otherwise take. And though the loveof a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment onceraised, but you may in time come to love a rose?""""But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors. The pleasureof walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in fine weatherI am out more than half my time. Mamma says I am never within.""""At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to lovea hyacinth. The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and ateachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing. Has mysister a pleasant mode of instruction?""Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by theentrance of the general, whose smiling compliments announced a happystate of mind, but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did notadvance her composure.The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine's noticewhen they were seated at table; and, luckily, it had been the general'schoice. He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste, confessed itto be neat and simple, thought it right to encourage the manufacture ofhis country; and for his part, to his uncritical palate, the tea was aswell flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire, as from that of Dresdenor Save. But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago.The manufacture was much improved since that time; he had seen somebeautiful specimens when last in town, and had he not been perfectlywithout vanity of that kind, might have been tempted to order a newset. He trusted, however, that an opportunity might ere long occur ofselecting one--though not for himself. Catherine was probably the onlyone of the party who did not understand him.Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston, where businessrequired and would keep him two or three days. They all attended inthe hall to see him mount his horse, and immediately on re-entering thebreakfast-room, Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catchinganother glimpse of his figure. ""This is a somewhat heavy call upon yourbrother's fortitude,"" observed the general to Eleanor. ""Woodston willmake but a sombre appearance today.""""Is it a pretty place?"" asked Catherine.""What say you, Eleanor? Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell thetaste of ladies in regard to places as well as men. I think it would beacknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations. Thehouse stands among fine meadows facing the south-east, with an excellentkitchen-garden in the same aspect; the walls surrounding which I builtand stocked myself about ten years ago, for the benefit of my son. Itis a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place beingchiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a badone. Did Henry's income depend solely on this living, he would not beill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two youngerchildren, I should think any profession necessary for him; and certainlythere are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tieof business. But though I may not exactly make converts of you youngladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with me inthinking it expedient to give every young man some employment. Themoney is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing.Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit asconsiderable a landed property as any private man in the county, has hisprofession.""The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his wishes. Thesilence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable.Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over thehouse, and he now offered himself as her conductor; and though Catherinehad hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter, it was aproposal of too much happiness in itself, under any circumstances, notto be gladly accepted; for she had been already eighteen hours in theabbey, and had seen only a few of its rooms. The netting-box, justleisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste, and she was readyto attend him in a moment. ""And when they had gone over the house, hepromised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into theshrubberies and garden."" She curtsied her acquiescence. ""But perhapsit might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object.The weather was at present favourable, and at this time of year theuncertainty was very great of its continuing so. Which would she prefer?He was equally at her service. Which did his daughter think would mostaccord with her fair friend's wishes? But he thought he could discern.Yes, he certainly read in Miss Morland's eyes a judicious desire ofmaking use of the present smiling weather. But when did she judge amiss?The abbey would be always safe and dry. He yielded implicitly, andwould fetch his hat and attend them in a moment."" He left the room,and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious face, began to speak of herunwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his owninclination, under a mistaken idea of pleasing her; but she was stoppedby Miss Tilney's saying, with a little confusion, ""I believe it will bewisest to take the morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy onmy father's account; he always walks out at this time of day.""Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood. Whywas Miss Tilney embarrassed? Could there be any unwillingness on thegeneral's side to show her over the abbey? The proposal was his own. Andwas not it odd that he should always take his walk so early? Neither herfather nor Mr. Allen did so. It was certainly very provoking. She wasall impatience to see the house, and had scarcely any curiosity aboutthe grounds. If Henry had been with them indeed! But now she should notknow what was picturesque when she saw it. Such were her thoughts, butshe kept them to herself, and put on her bonnet in patient discontent.She was struck, however, beyond her expectation, by the grandeur ofthe abbey, as she saw it for the first time from the lawn. The wholebuilding enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, richin Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration. The remainder wasshut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant plantations, and the steepwoody hills rising behind, to give it shelter, were beautiful even inthe leafless month of March. Catherine had seen nothing to compare withit; and her feelings of delight were so strong, that without waiting forany better authority, she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise. Thegeneral listened with assenting gratitude; and it seemed as if his ownestimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour.The kitchen-garden was to be next admired, and he led the way to itacross a small portion of the park.The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine couldnot listen to without dismay, being more than double the extent of allMr. Allen's, as well as her father's, including church-yard and orchard.The walls seemed countless in number, endless in length; a village ofhot-houses seemed to arise among them, and a whole parish to be atwork within the enclosure. The general was flattered by her looks ofsurprise, which told him almost as plainly, as he soon forced her totell him in words, that she had never seen any gardens at all equal tothem before; and he then modestly owned that, ""without any ambition ofthat sort himself--without any solicitude about it--he did believe themto be unrivalled in the kingdom. If he had a hobby-horse, it was that.He loved a garden. Though careless enough in most matters of eating, heloved good fruit--or if he did not, his friends and children did. Therewere great vexations, however, attending such a garden as his. Theutmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits. The pineryhad yielded only one hundred in the last year. Mr. Allen, he supposed,must feel these inconveniences as well as himself.""""No, not at all. Mr. Allen did not care about the garden, and never wentinto it.""With a triumphant smile of self-satisfaction, the general wished hecould do the same, for he never entered his, without being vexed in someway or other, by its falling short of his plan.""How were Mr. Allen's succession-houses worked?"" describing the natureof his own as they entered them.""Mr. Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs. Allen had the use offor her plants in winter, and there was a fire in it now and then.""""He is a happy man!"" said the general, with a look of very happycontempt.Having taken her into every division, and led her under every wall, tillshe was heartily weary of seeing and wondering, he suffered the girlsat last to seize the advantage of an outer door, and then expressinghis wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about thetea-house, proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk, if MissMorland were not tired. ""But where are you going, Eleanor? Why do youchoose that cold, damp path to it? Miss Morland will get wet. Our bestway is across the park.""""This is so favourite a walk of mine,"" said Miss Tilney, ""that I alwaysthink it the best and nearest way. But perhaps it may be damp.""It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs;and Catherine, struck by its gloomy aspect, and eager to enter it,could not, even by the general's disapprobation, be kept from steppingforward. He perceived her inclination, and having again urged the pleaof health in vain, was too polite to make further opposition. He excusedhimself, however, from attending them: ""The rays of the sun were not toocheerful for him, and he would meet them by another course."" He turnedaway; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits wererelieved by the separation. The shock, however, being less real than therelief, offered it no injury; and she began to talk with easy gaiety ofthe delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired.""I am particularly fond of this spot,"" said her companion, with a sigh.""It was my mother's favourite walk.""Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before,and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itselfdirectly in her altered countenance, and in the attentive pause withwhich she waited for something more.""I used to walk here so often with her!"" added Eleanor; ""though I neverloved it then, as I have loved it since. At that time indeed I used towonder at her choice. But her memory endears it now.""""And ought it not,"" reflected Catherine, ""to endear it to her husband?Yet the general would not enter it."" Miss Tilney continuing silent, sheventured to say, ""Her death must have been a great affliction!""""A great and increasing one,"" replied the other, in a low voice. ""I wasonly thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps asstrongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, thenknow what a loss it was."" She stopped for a moment, and then added, withgreat firmness, ""I have no sister, you know--and though Henry--though mybrothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which Iam most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary.""""To be sure you must miss him very much.""""A mother would have been always present. A mother would have been aconstant friend; her influence would have been beyond all other.""""Was she a very charming woman? Was she handsome? Was there any pictureof her in the abbey? And why had she been so partial to that grove? Wasit from dejection of spirits?""--were questions now eagerly poured forth;the first three received a ready affirmative, the two others were passedby; and Catherine's interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented withevery question, whether answered or not. Of her unhappiness in marriage,she felt persuaded. The general certainly had been an unkind husband. Hedid not love her walk: could he therefore have loved her? And besides,handsome as he was, there was a something in the turn of his featureswhich spoke his not having behaved well to her.""Her picture, I suppose,"" blushing at the consummate art of her ownquestion, ""hangs in your father's room?""""No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father wasdissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place.Soon after her death I obtained it for my own, and hung it in mybed-chamber--where I shall be happy to show it you; it is very like.""Here was another proof. A portrait--very like--of a departed wife, notvalued by the husband! He must have been dreadfully cruel to her!Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of thefeelings which, in spite of all his attentions, he had previouslyexcited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absoluteaversion. Yes, aversion! His cruelty to such a charming woman made himodious to her. She had often read of such characters, characters whichMr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn; but here wasproof positive of the contrary.She had just settled this point when the end of the path brought themdirectly upon the general; and in spite of all her virtuous indignation,she found herself again obliged to walk with him, listen to him, andeven to smile when he smiled. Being no longer able, however, to receivepleasure from the surrounding objects, she soon began to walk withlassitude; the general perceived it, and with a concern for her health,which seemed to reproach her for her opinion of him, was most urgentfor returning with his daughter to the house. He would follow them ina quarter of an hour. Again they parted--but Eleanor was called back inhalf a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her friend roundthe abbey till his return. This second instance of his anxiety to delaywhat she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable."
Northanger Abbey,23,"CHAPTER 23An hour passed away before the general came in, spent, on the part ofhis young guest, in no very favourable consideration of his character.""This lengthened absence, these solitary rambles, did not speak a mindat ease, or a conscience void of reproach."" At length he appeared; and,whatever might have been the gloom of his meditations, he could stillsmile with them. Miss Tilney, understanding in part her friend'scuriosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and her fatherbeing, contrary to Catherine's expectations, unprovided with anypretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes toorder refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last readyto escort them.They set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step,which caught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-readCatherine, he led the way across the hall, through the commondrawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent bothin size and furniture--the real drawing-room, used only with company ofconsequence. It was very noble--very grand--very charming!--was all thatCatherine had to say, for her indiscriminating eye scarcely discernedthe colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praisethat had much meaning, was supplied by the general: the costliness orelegance of any room's fitting-up could be nothing to her; she cared forno furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century. When thegeneral had satisfied his own curiosity, in a close examination of everywell-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an apartment, inits way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection of books, onwhich an humble man might have looked with pride. Catherine heard,admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before--gatheredall that she could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running overthe titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed. But suites ofapartments did not spring up with her wishes. Large as was the building,she had already visited the greatest part; though, on being told that,with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven rooms she had nowseen surrounded three sides of the court, she could scarcely believe it,or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted. It wassome relief, however, that they were to return to the rooms in commonuse, by passing through a few of less importance, looking into thecourt, which, with occasional passages, not wholly unintricate,connected the different sides; and she was further soothed in herprogress by being told that she was treading what had once been acloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and observing severaldoors that were neither opened nor explained to her--by finding herselfsuccessively in a billiard-room, and in the general's private apartment,without comprehending their connection, or being able to turn arightwhen she left them; and lastly, by passing through a dark little room,owning Henry's authority, and strewed with his litter of books, guns,and greatcoats.From the dining-room, of which, though already seen, and always to beseen at five o'clock, the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacingout the length, for the more certain information of Miss Morland, asto what she neither doubted nor cared for, they proceeded by quickcommunication to the kitchen--the ancient kitchen of the convent, richin the massy walls and smoke of former days, and in the stoves and hotclosets of the present. The general's improving hand had not loiteredhere: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks hadbeen adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and, when the geniusof others had failed, his own had often produced the perfection wanted.His endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him highamong the benefactors of the convent.With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey; thefourth side of the quadrangle having, on account of its decaying state,been removed by the general's father, and the present erected in itsplace. All that was venerable ceased here. The new building was notonly new, but declared itself to be so; intended only for offices, andenclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had beenthought necessary. Catherine could have raved at the hand which hadswept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for thepurposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been sparedthe mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the generalallowed it; but if he had a vanity, it was in the arrangement of hisoffices; and as he was convinced that, to a mind like Miss Morland's,a view of the accommodations and comforts, by which the labours of herinferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, he should makeno apology for leading her on. They took a slight survey of all; andCatherine was impressed, beyond her expectation, by their multiplicityand their convenience. The purposes for which a few shapeless pantriesand a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton, werehere carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious and roomy. Thenumber of servants continually appearing did not strike her less thanthe number of their offices. Wherever they went, some pattened girlstopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked off. Yet thiswas an abbey! How inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangementsfrom such as she had read about--from abbeys and castles, in which,though certainly larger than Northanger, all the dirty work of the housewas to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost. How they couldget through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen; and, when Catherine sawwhat was necessary here, she began to be amazed herself.They returned to the hall, that the chief staircase might be ascended,and the beauty of its wood, and ornaments of rich carving might bepointed out: having gained the top, they turned in an opposite directionfrom the gallery in which her room lay, and shortly entered one onthe same plan, but superior in length and breadth. She was here shownsuccessively into three large bed-chambers, with their dressing-rooms,most completely and handsomely fitted up; everything that money andtaste could do, to give comfort and elegance to apartments, had beenbestowed on these; and, being furnished within the last five years, theywere perfect in all that would be generally pleasing, and wanting in allthat could give pleasure to Catherine. As they were surveying the last,the general, after slightly naming a few of the distinguished charactersby whom they had at times been honoured, turned with a smilingcountenance to Catherine, and ventured to hope that henceforward some oftheir earliest tenants might be ""our friends from Fullerton."" She feltthe unexpected compliment, and deeply regretted the impossibility ofthinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself, and so fullof civility to all her family.The gallery was terminated by folding doors, which Miss Tilney,advancing, had thrown open, and passed through, and seemed on the pointof doing the same by the first door to the left, in another long reachof gallery, when the general, coming forwards, called her hastily, and,as Catherine thought, rather angrily back, demanding whether she weregoing?--And what was there more to be seen?--Had not Miss Morlandalready seen all that could be worth her notice?--And did she notsuppose her friend might be glad of some refreshment after so muchexercise? Miss Tilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors wereclosed upon the mortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentaryglance beyond them, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, andsymptoms of a winding staircase, believed herself at last within thereach of something worth her notice; and felt, as she unwillingly pacedback the gallery, that she would rather be allowed to examine that endof the house than see all the finery of all the rest. The general'sevident desire of preventing such an examination was an additionalstimulant. Something was certainly to be concealed; her fancy, thoughit had trespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead her here;and what that something was, a short sentence of Miss Tilney's, as theyfollowed the general at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out:""I was going to take you into what was my mother's room--the roomin which she died--"" were all her words; but few as they were, theyconveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine. It was no wonder that thegeneral should shrink from the sight of such objects as that roommust contain; a room in all probability never entered by him since thedreadful scene had passed, which released his suffering wife, and lefthim to the stings of conscience.She ventured, when next alone with Eleanor, to express her wish of beingpermitted to see it, as well as all the rest of that side of the house;and Eleanor promised to attend her there, whenever they should have aconvenient hour. Catherine understood her: the general must be watchedfrom home, before that room could be entered. ""It remains as it was, Isuppose?"" said she, in a tone of feeling.""Yes, entirely.""""And how long ago may it be that your mother died?""""She has been dead these nine years."" And nine years, Catherine knew,was a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after thedeath of an injured wife, before her room was put to rights.""You were with her, I suppose, to the last?""""No,"" said Miss Tilney, sighing; ""I was unfortunately from home. Herillness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over.""Catherine's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturallysprang from these words. Could it be possible? Could Henry's father--?And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackestsuspicions! And, when she saw him in the evening, while she workedwith her friend, slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hour together insilent thoughtfulness, with downcast eyes and contracted brow, she feltsecure from all possibility of wronging him. It was the air and attitudeof a Montoni! What could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of amind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in its fearful reviewof past scenes of guilt? Unhappy man! And the anxiousness of her spiritsdirected her eyes towards his figure so repeatedly, as to catch MissTilney's notice. ""My father,"" she whispered, ""often walks about the roomin this way; it is nothing unusual.""""So much the worse!"" thought Catherine; such ill-timed exercise was of apiece with the strange unseasonableness of his morning walks, and bodednothing good.After an evening, the little variety and seeming length of which madeher peculiarly sensible of Henry's importance among them, she washeartily glad to be dismissed; though it was a look from the general notdesigned for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell.When the butler would have lit his master's candle, however, he wasforbidden. The latter was not going to retire. ""I have many pamphlets tofinish,"" said he to Catherine, ""before I can close my eyes, and perhapsmay be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you areasleep. Can either of us be more meetly employed? My eyes will beblinding for the good of others, and yours preparing by rest for futuremischief.""But neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment,could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object mustoccasion so serious a delay of proper repose. To be kept up for hours,after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely.There must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which couldbe done only while the household slept; and the probability that Mrs.Tilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from thepitiless hands of her husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was theconclusion which necessarily followed. Shocking as was the idea, itwas at least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the naturalcourse of things, she must ere long be released. The suddenness of herreputed illness, the absence of her daughter, and probably of her otherchildren, at the time--all favoured the supposition of her imprisonment.Its origin--jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty--was yet to beunravelled.In revolving these matters, while she undressed, it suddenly struck heras not unlikely that she might that morning have passed near the veryspot of this unfortunate woman's confinement--might have been withina few paces of the cell in which she languished out her days; for whatpart of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that whichyet bore the traces of monastic division? In the high-arched passage,paved with stone, which already she had trodden with peculiar awe, shewell remembered the doors of which the general had given no account. Towhat might not those doors lead? In support of the plausibility of thisconjecture, it further occurred to her that the forbidden gallery, inwhich lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, ascertainly as her memory could guide her, exactly over this suspectedrange of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments ofwhich she had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by somesecret means with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarousproceedings of her husband. Down that staircase she had perhaps beenconveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility!Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her own surmises, andsometimes hoped or feared that she had gone too far; but they weresupported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible.The side of the quadrangle, in which she supposed the guilty scene to beacting, being, according to her belief, just opposite her own, it struckher that, if judiciously watched, some rays of light from the general'slamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he passed to the prisonof his wife; and, twice before she stepped into bed, she stole gentlyfrom her room to the corresponding window in the gallery, to see if itappeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too early. Thevarious ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still beup. Till midnight, she supposed it would be in vain to watch; but then,when the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet, she would, if notquite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once more. The clockstruck twelve--and Catherine had been half an hour asleep."
Northanger Abbey,24,"CHAPTER 24The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of themysterious apartments. It was Sunday, and the whole time between morningand afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad oreating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine's curiosity, hercourage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner, eitherby the fading light of the sky between six and seven o'clock, or by theyet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp.The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imaginationbeyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs.Tilney, which immediately fronted the family pew. By that her eyewas instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of the highlystrained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her by theinconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other herdestroyer, affected her even to tears.That the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to faceit, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he could sit so boldlycollected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look sofearlessly around, nay, that he should even enter the church, seemedwonderful to Catherine. Not, however, that many instances of beingsequally hardened in guilt might not be produced. She could rememberdozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime tocrime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of humanityor remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed theirblack career. The erection of the monument itself could not in thesmallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney's actual decease. Wereshe even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposedto slumber, were she to behold the coffin in which they were said tobe enclosed--what could it avail in such a case? Catherine had read toomuch not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figuremight be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried on.The succeeding morning promised something better. The general's earlywalk, ill-timed as it was in every other view, was favourable here; andwhen she knew him to be out of the house, she directly proposed to MissTilney the accomplishment of her promise. Eleanor was ready to obligeher; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise, theirfirst visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed-chamber. Itrepresented a very lovely woman, with a mild and pensive countenance,justifying, so far, the expectations of its new observer; but they werenot in every respect answered, for Catherine had depended upon meetingwith features, hair, complexion, that should be the very counterpart,the very image, if not of Henry's, of Eleanor's--the only portraits ofwhich she had been in the habit of thinking, bearing always an equalresemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken forgenerations. But here she was obliged to look and consider and studyfor a likeness. She contemplated it, however, in spite of this drawback,with much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest, would have leftit unwillingly.Her agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for anyendeavour at discourse; she could only look at her companion. Eleanor'scountenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her inuredto all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing. Again she passedthrough the folding doors, again her hand was upon the important lock,and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to close the formerwith fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded figure of the generalhimself at the further end of the gallery, stood before her! The name of""Eleanor"" at the same moment, in his loudest tone, resounded through thebuilding, giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence,and to Catherine terror upon terror. An attempt at concealment had beenher first instinctive movement on perceiving him, yet she couldscarcely hope to have escaped his eye; and when her friend, who with anapologizing look darted hastily by her, had joined and disappearedwith him, she ran for safety to her own room, and, locking herselfin, believed that she should never have courage to go down again. Sheremained there at least an hour, in the greatest agitation, deeplycommiserating the state of her poor friend, and expecting a summonsherself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment. Nosummons, however, arrived; and at last, on seeing a carriage drive upto the abbey, she was emboldened to descend and meet him under theprotection of visitors. The breakfast-room was gay with company; andshe was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter, ina complimentary style, which so well concealed his resentful ire, as tomake her feel secure at least of life for the present. And Eleanor,with a command of countenance which did honour to her concern for hischaracter, taking an early occasion of saying to her, ""My father onlywanted me to answer a note,"" she began to hope that she had either beenunseen by the general, or that from some consideration of policy sheshould be allowed to suppose herself so. Upon this trust she dared stillto remain in his presence, after the company left them, and nothingoccurred to disturb it.In the course of this morning's reflections, she came to a resolutionof making her next attempt on the forbidden door alone. It would be muchbetter in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter.To involve her in the danger of a second detection, to court her intoan apartment which must wring her heart, could not be the office of afriend. The general's utmost anger could not be to herself what it mightbe to a daughter; and, besides, she thought the examination itselfwould be more satisfactory if made without any companion. It would beimpossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions, from which the otherhad, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily exempt; nor could shetherefore, in her presence, search for those proofs of the general'scruelty, which however they might yet have escaped discovery, she feltconfident of somewhere drawing forth, in the shape of some fragmentedjournal, continued to the last gasp. Of the way to the apartment she wasnow perfectly mistress; and as she wished to get it over before Henry'sreturn, who was expected on the morrow, there was no time to be lost.The day was bright, her courage high; at four o'clock, the sun was nowtwo hours above the horizon, and it would be only her retiring to dresshalf an hour earlier than usual.It was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before theclocks had ceased to strike. It was no time for thought; she hurriedon, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors,and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the one inquestion. The lock yielded to her hand, and, luckily, with no sullensound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she entered; the roomwas before her; but it was some minutes before she could advance anotherstep. She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature.She saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome dimity bed,arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid's care, a bright Bath stove,mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the warm beamsof a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows! Catherine hadexpected to have her feelings worked, and worked they were. Astonishmentand doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of commonsense added some bitter emotions of shame. She could not be mistakenas to the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!--in MissTilney's meaning, in her own calculation! This apartment, to which shehad given a date so ancient, a position so awful, proved to be one endof what the general's father had built. There were two other doors inthe chamber, leading probably into dressing-closets; but she had noinclination to open either. Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had lastwalked, or the volume in which she had last read, remain to tell whatnothing else was allowed to whisper? No: whatever might have been thegeneral's crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue fordetection. She was sick of exploring, and desired but to be safe in herown room, with her own heart only privy to its folly; and she was onthe point of retreating as softly as she had entered, when the sound offootsteps, she could hardly tell where, made her pause and tremble.To be found there, even by a servant, would be unpleasant; but by thegeneral (and he seemed always at hand when least wanted), much worse!She listened--the sound had ceased; and resolving not to lose amoment, she passed through and closed the door. At that instant a doorunderneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift steps to ascendthe stairs, by the head of which she had yet to pass before she couldgain the gallery. She had no power to move. With a feeling of terrornot very definable, she fixed her eyes on the staircase, and in a fewmoments it gave Henry to her view. ""Mr. Tilney!"" she exclaimed in avoice of more than common astonishment. He looked astonished too. ""GoodGod!"" she continued, not attending to his address. ""How came you here?How came you up that staircase?""""How came I up that staircase!"" he replied, greatly surprised. ""Becauseit is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and whyshould I not come up it?""Catherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more. Heseemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which herlips did not afford. She moved on towards the gallery. ""And may I not,in my turn,"" said he, as he pushed back the folding doors, ""ask how youcame here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from thebreakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be from thestables to mine.""""I have been,"" said Catherine, looking down, ""to see your mother'sroom.""""My mother's room! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?""""No, nothing at all. I thought you did not mean to come back tilltomorrow.""""I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; butthree hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me. Youlook pale. I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs.Perhaps you did not know--you were not aware of their leading from theoffices in common use?""""No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride.""""Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms inthe house by yourself?""""Oh! No; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday--and we werecoming here to these rooms--but only""--dropping her voice--""your fatherwas with us.""""And that prevented you,"" said Henry, earnestly regarding her. ""Have youlooked into all the rooms in that passage?""""No, I only wanted to see--Is not it very late? I must go and dress.""""It is only a quarter past four"" showing his watch--""and you are not nowin Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at Northangermust be enough.""She could not contradict it, and therefore suffered herself to bedetained, though her dread of further questions made her, for the firsttime in their acquaintance, wish to leave him. They walked slowly up thegallery. ""Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?""""No, and I am very much surprised. Isabella promised so faithfully towrite directly.""""Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I haveheard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise--the fidelityof promising! It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it candeceive and pain you. My mother's room is very commodious, is it not?Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed!It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house, andI rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own. She sentyou to look at it, I suppose?""""No.""""It has been your own doing entirely?"" Catherine said nothing. After ashort silence, during which he had closely observed her, he added, ""Asthere is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this musthave proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother's character,as described by Eleanor, which does honour to her memory. The world, Ibelieve, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue canboast an interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits of aperson never known do not often create that kind of fervent, veneratingtenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose,has talked of her a great deal?""""Yes, a great deal. That is--no, not much, but what she did say was veryinteresting. Her dying so suddenly"" (slowly, and with hesitation itwas spoken), ""and you--none of you being at home--and your father, Ithought--perhaps had not been very fond of her.""""And from these circumstances,"" he replied (his quick eyefixed on hers), ""you infer perhaps the probability of somenegligence--some""--(involuntarily she shook her head)--""or it may be--ofsomething still less pardonable."" She raised her eyes towards himmore fully than she had ever done before. ""My mother's illness,"" hecontinued, ""the seizure which ended in her death, was sudden. The maladyitself, one from which she had often suffered, a bilious fever--itscause therefore constitutional. On the third day, in short, as soon asshe could be prevailed on, a physician attended her, a very respectableman, and one in whom she had always placed great confidence. Upon hisopinion of her danger, two others were called in the next day, andremained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours. On thefifth day she died. During the progress of her disorder, Frederick and I(we were both at home) saw her repeatedly; and from our own observationcan bear witness to her having received every possible attentionwhich could spring from the affection of those about her, or which hersituation in life could command. Poor Eleanor was absent, and at such adistance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin.""""But your father,"" said Catherine, ""was he afflicted?""""For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing him not attachedto her. He loved her, I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for himto--we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition--andI will not pretend to say that while she lived, she might not often havehad much to bear, but though his temper injured her, his judgment neverdid. His value of her was sincere; and, if not permanently, he was trulyafflicted by her death.""""I am very glad of it,"" said Catherine; ""it would have been veryshocking!""""If I understand you rightly, you had formed a surmise of such horror asI have hardly words to--Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful natureof the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from?Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we areEnglish, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, yourown sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passingaround you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do ourlaws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated without being known, ina country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such afooting, where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntaryspies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open? Dearest MissMorland, what ideas have you been admitting?""They had reached the end of the gallery, and with tears of shame she ranoff to her own room."
Northanger Abbey,25,"CHAPTER 25The visions of romance were over. Catherine was completely awakened.Henry's address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened hereyes to the extravagance of her late fancies than all their severaldisappointments had done. Most grievously was she humbled. Most bitterlydid she cry. It was not only with herself that she was sunk--but withHenry. Her folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all exposed tohim, and he must despise her forever. The liberty which her imaginationhad dared to take with the character of his father--could he everforgive it? The absurdity of her curiosity and her fears--could theyever be forgotten? She hated herself more than she could express. Hehad--she thought he had, once or twice before this fatal morning, shownsomething like affection for her. But now--in short, she made herself asmiserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when theclock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give anintelligible answer to Eleanor's inquiry if she was well. The formidableHenry soon followed her into the room, and the only difference in hisbehaviour to her was that he paid her rather more attention than usual.Catherine had never wanted comfort more, and he looked as if he wasaware of it.The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness; andher spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity. She did notlearn either to forget or defend the past; but she learned to hope thatit would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost her Henry'sentire regard. Her thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she hadwith such causeless terror felt and done, nothing could shortly beclearer than that it had been all a voluntary, self-created delusion,each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imaginationresolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one purpose bya mind which, before she entered the abbey, had been craving to befrightened. She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for aknowledge of Northanger. She saw that the infatuation had been created,the mischief settled, long before her quitting Bath, and it seemed as ifthe whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading whichshe had there indulged.Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe's works, and charming even as werethe works of all her imitators, it was not in them perhaps that humannature, at least in the Midland counties of England, was to be lookedfor. Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with their pine forests and their vices,they might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, andthe south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were thererepresented. Catherine dared not doubt beyond her own country, and evenof that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and westernextremities. But in the central part of England there was surely somesecurity for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws ofthe land, and the manners of the age. Murder was not tolerated, servantswere not slaves, and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured,like rhubarb, from every druggist. Among the Alps and Pyrenees, perhaps,there were no mixed characters. There, such as were not as spotless asan angel might have the dispositions of a fiend. But in England it wasnot so; among the English, she believed, in their hearts and habits,there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad. Upon thisconviction, she would not be surprised if even in Henry and EleanorTilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter appear; and upon thisconviction she need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks inthe character of their father, who, though cleared from the grosslyinjurious suspicions which she must ever blush to have entertained, shedid believe, upon serious consideration, to be not perfectly amiable.Her mind made up on these several points, and her resolution formed, ofalways judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense, shehad nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever; andthe lenient hand of time did much for her by insensible gradations inthe course of another day. Henry's astonishing generosity and noblenessof conduct, in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed,was of the greatest assistance to her; and sooner than she could havesupposed it possible in the beginning of her distress, her spiritsbecame absolutely comfortable, and capable, as heretofore, of continualimprovement by anything he said. There were still some subjects, indeed,under which she believed they must always tremble--the mention of achest or a cabinet, for instance--and she did not love the sight ofjapan in any shape: but even she could allow that an occasional mementoof past folly, however painful, might not be without use.The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms ofromance. Her desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater.She was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how therooms were attended; and especially was she anxious to be assured ofIsabella's having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which she hadleft her intent; and of her continuing on the best terms with James. Heronly dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella. James hadprotested against writing to her till his return to Oxford; and Mrs.Allen had given her no hopes of a letter till she had got back toFullerton. But Isabella had promised and promised again; and when shepromised a thing, she was so scrupulous in performing it! This made itso particularly strange!For nine successive mornings, Catherine wondered over the repetitionof a disappointment, which each morning became more severe: but, onthe tenth, when she entered the breakfast-room, her first object was aletter, held out by Henry's willing hand. She thanked him as heartilyas if he had written it himself. ""'Tis only from James, however,"" as shelooked at the direction. She opened it; it was from Oxford; and to thispurpose:""Dear Catherine,""Though, God knows, with little inclination for writing, I think it myduty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe andme. I left her and Bath yesterday, never to see either again. I shallnot enter into particulars--they would only pain you more. You will soonhear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame; and Ihope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easilythinking his affection returned. Thank God! I am undeceived in time!But it is a heavy blow! After my father's consent had been so kindlygiven--but no more of this. She has made me miserable forever! Let mesoon hear from you, dear Catherine; you are my only friend; your loveI do build upon. I wish your visit at Northanger may be over beforeCaptain Tilney makes his engagement known, or you will be uncomfortablycircumstanced. Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of him; hishonest heart would feel so much. I have written to him and my father.Her duplicity hurts me more than all; till the very last, if I reasonedwith her, she declared herself as much attached to me as ever, andlaughed at my fears. I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it;but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved, I was that man. Icannot understand even now what she would be at, for there could be noneed of my being played off to make her secure of Tilney. We partedat last by mutual consent--happy for me had we never met! I can neverexpect to know such another woman! Dearest Catherine, beware how yougive your heart.""Believe me,"" &c.Catherine had not read three lines before her sudden change ofcountenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared her tobe receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching her throughthe whole letter, saw plainly that it ended no better than it began. Hewas prevented, however, from even looking his surprise by his father'sentrance. They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could hardlyeat anything. Tears filled her eyes, and even ran down her cheeks as shesat. The letter was one moment in her hand, then in her lap, and then inher pocket; and she looked as if she knew not what she did. The general,between his cocoa and his newspaper, had luckily no leisure for noticingher; but to the other two her distress was equally visible. As soonas she dared leave the table she hurried away to her own room; but thehousemaids were busy in it, and she was obliged to come down again.She turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but Henry and Eleanor hadlikewise retreated thither, and were at that moment deep in consultationabout her. She drew back, trying to beg their pardon, but was, withgentle violence, forced to return; and the others withdrew, afterEleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfortto her.After half an hour's free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherinefelt equal to encountering her friends; but whether she should makeher distress known to them was another consideration. Perhaps, ifparticularly questioned, she might just give an idea--just distantlyhint at it--but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabellahad been to her--and then their own brother so closely concerned in it!She believed she must waive the subject altogether. Henry and Eleanorwere by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she entered it,looked at her anxiously. Catherine took her place at the table, and,after a short silence, Eleanor said, ""No bad news from Fullerton, Ihope? Mr. and Mrs. Morland--your brothers and sisters--I hope they arenone of them ill?""""No, I thank you"" (sighing as she spoke); ""they are all very well. Myletter was from my brother at Oxford.""Nothing further was said for a few minutes; and then speaking throughher tears, she added, ""I do not think I shall ever wish for a letteragain!""""I am sorry,"" said Henry, closing the book he had just opened; ""if Ihad suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should havegiven it with very different feelings.""""It contained something worse than anybody could suppose! Poor James isso unhappy! You will soon know why.""""To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,"" replied Henrywarmly, ""must be a comfort to him under any distress.""""I have one favour to beg,"" said Catherine, shortly afterwards, in anagitated manner, ""that, if your brother should be coming here, you willgive me notice of it, that I may go away.""""Our brother! Frederick!""""Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon, butsomething has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be inthe same house with Captain Tilney.""Eleanor's work was suspended while she gazed with increasingastonishment; but Henry began to suspect the truth, and something, inwhich Miss Thorpe's name was included, passed his lips.""How quick you are!"" cried Catherine: ""you have guessed it, I declare!And yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of itsending so. Isabella--no wonder now I have not heard from her--Isabellahas deserted my brother, and is to marry yours! Could you have believedthere had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that isbad in the world?""""I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed. I hopehe has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland'sdisappointment. His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think youmust be deceived so far. I am very sorry for Mr. Morland--sorry thatanyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater atFrederick's marrying her than at any other part of the story.""""It is very true, however; you shall read James's letter yourself.Stay--There is one part--"" recollecting with a blush the last line.""Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concernmy brother?""""No, read it yourself,"" cried Catherine, whose second thoughts wereclearer. ""I do not know what I was thinking of"" (blushing again that shehad blushed before); ""James only means to give me good advice.""He gladly received the letter, and, having read it through, with closeattention, returned it saying, ""Well, if it is to be so, I can onlysay that I am sorry for it. Frederick will not be the first man who haschosen a wife with less sense than his family expected. I do not envyhis situation, either as a lover or a son.""Miss Tilney, at Catherine's invitation, now read the letter likewise,and, having expressed also her concern and surprise, began to inquireinto Miss Thorpe's connections and fortune.""Her mother is a very good sort of woman,"" was Catherine's answer.""What was her father?""""A lawyer, I believe. They live at Putney.""""Are they a wealthy family?""""No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: butthat will not signify in your family. Your father is so very liberal!He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him topromote the happiness of his children."" The brother and sister lookedat each other. ""But,"" said Eleanor, after a short pause, ""would it be topromote his happiness, to enable him to marry such a girl? She must bean unprincipled one, or she could not have used your brother so. And howstrange an infatuation on Frederick's side! A girl who, before his eyes,is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man! Isnot it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always wore his heart soproudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!""""That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumptionagainst him. When I think of his past declarations, I give him up.Moreover, I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe's prudence tosuppose that she would part with one gentleman before the otherwas secured. It is all over with Frederick indeed! He is a deceasedman--defunct in understanding. Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor,and such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless,guileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions,and knowing no disguise.""""Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,"" said Eleanor with asmile.""But perhaps,"" observed Catherine, ""though she has behaved so ill by ourfamily, she may behave better by yours. Now she has really got the manshe likes, she may be constant.""""Indeed I am afraid she will,"" replied Henry; ""I am afraid she willbe very constant, unless a baronet should come in her way; that isFrederick's only chance. I will get the Bath paper, and look over thearrivals.""""You think it is all for ambition, then? And, upon my word, there aresome things that seem very like it. I cannot forget that, when she firstknew what my father would do for them, she seemed quite disappointedthat it was not more. I never was so deceived in anyone's character inmy life before.""""Among all the great variety that you have known and studied.""""My own disappointment and loss in her is very great; but, as for poorJames, I suppose he will hardly ever recover it.""""Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but wemust not, in our concern for his sufferings, undervalue yours. You feel,I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel avoid in your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is becomingirksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share atBath, the very idea of them without her is abhorrent. You would not,for instance, now go to a ball for the world. You feel that you have nolonger any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on whose regardyou can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any difficulty, you couldrely on. You feel all this?""""No,"" said Catherine, after a few moments' reflection, ""I do not--oughtI? To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I cannot stilllove her, that I am never to hear from her, perhaps never to see heragain, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would havethought.""""You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human nature.Such feelings ought to be investigated, that they may know themselves.""Catherine, by some chance or other, found her spirits so very muchrelieved by this conversation that she could not regret her being ledon, though so unaccountably, to mention the circumstance which hadproduced it."
Northanger Abbey,26,"CHAPTER 26From this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three youngpeople; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that her two youngfriends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella's want ofconsequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the wayof her marrying their brother. Their persuasion that the general would,upon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might beraised against her character, oppose the connection, turned her feelingsmoreover with some alarm towards herself. She was as insignificant,and perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir of the Tilneyproperty had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself, at what pointof interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest? The verypainful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed bya dependence on the effect of that particular partiality, which, as shewas given to understand by his words as well as his actions, she hadfrom the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general; and by arecollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on thesubject of money, which she had more than once heard him utter, andwhich tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstoodby his children.They were so fully convinced, however, that their brother would nothave the courage to apply in person for his father's consent, and sorepeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely tocome to Northanger than at the present time, that she suffered her mindto be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own. Butas it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he made hisapplication, would give his father any just idea of Isabella's conduct,it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the wholebusiness before him as it really was, enabling the general by that meansto form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his objections ona fairer ground than inequality of situations. She proposed it to himaccordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she hadexpected. ""No,"" said he, ""my father's hands need not be strengthened,and Frederick's confession of folly need not be forestalled. He musttell his own story.""""But he will tell only half of it.""""A quarter would be enough.""A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney. Hisbrother and sister knew not what to think. Sometimes it appeared tothem as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspectedengagement, and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it.The general, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick'sremissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about him, and hadno more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland's time atNorthanger pass pleasantly. He often expressed his uneasiness on thishead, feared the sameness of every day's society and employments woulddisgust her with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in thecountry, talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner,and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancingpeople in the neighbourhood. But then it was such a dead time of year,no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the country.And it all ended, at last, in his telling Henry one morning that when henext went to Woodston, they would take him by surprise there some dayor other, and eat their mutton with him. Henry was greatly honoured andvery happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme. ""And whendo you think, sir, I may look forward to this pleasure? I must be atWoodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting, and shall probably beobliged to stay two or three days.""""Well, well, we will take our chance some one of those days. There isno need to fix. You are not to put yourself at all out of your way.Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough. I think Ican answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor's table.Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come onMonday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I expect my surveyorfrom Brockham with his report in the morning; and afterwards I cannot indecency fail attending the club. I really could not face my acquaintanceif I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the country, it wouldbe taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss Morland,never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice oftime and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very worthy men.They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with themwhenever I can. Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question.But on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect us; and we shall bewith you early, that we may have time to look about us. Two hours andthree quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in thecarriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you maylook for us.""A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine thanthis little excursion, so strong was her desire to be acquainted withWoodston; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry, about anhour afterwards, came booted and greatcoated into the room where sheand Eleanor were sitting, and said, ""I am come, young ladies, in avery moralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this worldare always to be paid for, and that we often purchase them at a greatdisadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on thefuture, that may not be honoured. Witness myself, at this present hour.Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston onWednesday, which bad weather, or twenty other causes, may prevent, Imust go away directly, two days before I intended it.""""Go away!"" said Catherine, with a very long face. ""And why?""""Why! How can you ask the question? Because no time is to be lost infrightening my old housekeeper out of her wits, because I must go andprepare a dinner for you, to be sure.""""Oh! Not seriously!""""Aye, and sadly too--for I had much rather stay.""""But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said?When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble,because anything would do.""Henry only smiled. ""I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister'saccount and mine. You must know it to be so; and the general made sucha point of your providing nothing extraordinary: besides, if he had notsaid half so much as he did, he has always such an excellent dinnerat home, that sitting down to a middling one for one day could notsignify.""""I wish I could reason like you, for his sake and my own. Good-bye. Astomorrow is Sunday, Eleanor, I shall not return.""He went; and, it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherineto doubt her own judgment than Henry's, she was very soon obliged togive him credit for being right, however disagreeable to her his going.But the inexplicability of the general's conduct dwelt much on herthoughts. That he was very particular in his eating, she had, by her ownunassisted observation, already discovered; but why he should sayone thing so positively, and mean another all the while, was mostunaccountable! How were people, at that rate, to be understood? Who butHenry could have been aware of what his father was at?From Saturday to Wednesday, however, they were now to be without Henry.This was the sad finale of every reflection: and Captain Tilney's letterwould certainly come in his absence; and Wednesday she was very surewould be wet. The past, present, and future were all equally in gloom.Her brother so unhappy, and her loss in Isabella so great; and Eleanor'sspirits always affected by Henry's absence! What was there to interestor amuse her? She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies--always sosmooth and so dry; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now thanany other house. The painful remembrance of the folly it had helpedto nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from aconsideration of the building. What a revolution in her ideas! She, whohad so longed to be in an abbey! Now, there was nothing so charmingto her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connectedparsonage, something like Fullerton, but better: Fullerton had itsfaults, but Woodston probably had none. If Wednesday should ever come!It did come, and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for. Itcame--it was fine--and Catherine trod on air. By ten o'clock, the chaiseand four conveyed the trio from the abbey; and, after an agreeable driveof almost twenty miles, they entered Woodston, a large and populousvillage, in a situation not unpleasant. Catherine was ashamed to sayhow pretty she thought it, as the general seemed to think an apologynecessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the village;but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at,and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank ofa cottage, and at all the little chandler's shops which they passed. Atthe further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged from the restof it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial stone house, withits semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove up to thedoor, Henry, with the friends of his solitude, a large Newfoundlandpuppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and make much ofthem.Catherine's mind was too full, as she entered the house, for her eitherto observe or to say a great deal; and, till called on by the generalfor her opinion of it, she had very little idea of the room in which shewas sitting. Upon looking round it then, she perceived in a moment thatit was the most comfortable room in the world; but she was too guardedto say so, and the coldness of her praise disappointed him.""We are not calling it a good house,"" said he. ""We are not comparingit with Fullerton and Northanger--we are considering it as a mereparsonage, small and confined, we allow, but decent, perhaps, andhabitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in otherwords, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half sogood. It may admit of improvement, however. Far be it from me to sayotherwise; and anything in reason--a bow thrown out, perhaps--though,between ourselves, if there is one thing more than another my aversion,it is a patched-on bow.""Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be painedby it; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supportedby Henry, at the same time that a tray full of refreshments wasintroduced by his servant, the general was shortly restored to hiscomplacency, and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits.The room in question was of a commodious, well-proportioned size, andhandsomely fitted up as a dining-parlour; and on their quitting it towalk round the grounds, she was shown, first into a smaller apartment,belonging peculiarly to the master of the house, and made unusually tidyon the occasion; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing-room,with the appearance of which, though unfurnished, Catherine wasdelighted enough even to satisfy the general. It was a prettily shapedroom, the windows reaching to the ground, and the view from thempleasant, though only over green meadows; and she expressed heradmiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which shefelt it. ""Oh! Why do not you fit up this room, Mr. Tilney? What a pitynot to have it fitted up! It is the prettiest room I ever saw; it is theprettiest room in the world!""""I trust,"" said the general, with a most satisfied smile, ""that it willvery speedily be furnished: it waits only for a lady's taste!""""Well, if it was my house, I should never sit anywhere else. Oh! What asweet little cottage there is among the trees--apple trees, too! It isthe prettiest cottage!""""You like it--you approve it as an object--it is enough. Henry, rememberthat Robinson is spoken to about it. The cottage remains.""Such a compliment recalled all Catherine's consciousness, and silencedher directly; and, though pointedly applied to by the general for herchoice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings, nothing likean opinion on the subject could be drawn from her. The influence offresh objects and fresh air, however, was of great use in dissipatingthese embarrassing associations; and, having reached the ornamental partof the premises, consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow, onwhich Henry's genius had begun to act about half a year ago, she wassufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground shehad ever been in before, though there was not a shrub in it higher thanthe green bench in the corner.A saunter into other meadows, and through part of the village, with avisit to the stables to examine some improvements, and a charming gameof play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about, brought themto four o'clock, when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three. Atfour they were to dine, and at six to set off on their return. Never hadany day passed so quickly!She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seemto create the smallest astonishment in the general; nay, that he waseven looking at the side-table for cold meat which was not there. Hisson and daughter's observations were of a different kind. They hadseldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own, and neverbefore known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter's beingoiled.At six o'clock, the general having taken his coffee, the carriage againreceived them; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conductthroughout the whole visit, so well assured was her mind on the subjectof his expectations, that, could she have felt equally confident of thewishes of his son, Catherine would have quitted Woodston with littleanxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it."
Northanger Abbey,27,"CHAPTER 27The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter fromIsabella:Bath, AprilMy dearest Catherine, I received your two kind letters with the greatestdelight, and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering themsooner. I really am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horridplace one can find time for nothing. I have had my pen in my hand tobegin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but havealways been prevented by some silly trifler or other. Pray write to mesoon, and direct to my own home. Thank God, we leave this vile placetomorrow. Since you went away, I have had no pleasure in it--the dustis beyond anything; and everybody one cares for is gone. I believe if Icould see you I should not mind the rest, for you are dearer to me thananybody can conceive. I am quite uneasy about your dear brother, nothaving heard from him since he went to Oxford; and am fearful of somemisunderstanding. Your kind offices will set all right: he is the onlyman I ever did or could love, and I trust you will convince him of it.The spring fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful youcan imagine. I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am afraid younever think of me. I will not say all that I could of the family you arewith, because I would not be ungenerous, or set you against those youesteem; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust, and young mennever know their minds two days together. I rejoice to say that theyoung man whom, of all others, I particularly abhor, has left Bath. Youwill know, from this description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, asyou may remember, was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me, beforeyou went away. Afterwards he got worse, and became quite my shadow. Manygirls might have been taken in, for never were such attentions; but Iknew the fickle sex too well. He went away to his regiment two days ago,and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again. He is the greatestcoxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The last two days he wasalways by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied his taste, but took nonotice of him. The last time we met was in Bath Street, and I turneddirectly into a shop that he might not speak to me; I would not evenlook at him. He went into the pump-room afterwards; but I would not havefollowed him for all the world. Such a contrast between him and yourbrother! Pray send me some news of the latter--I am quite unhappy abouthim; he seemed so uncomfortable when he went away, with a cold, orsomething that affected his spirits. I would write to him myself, buthave mislaid his direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid hetook something in my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to hissatisfaction; or, if he still harbours any doubt, a line from himselfto me, or a call at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights.I have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except going inlast night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they teasedme into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself upbecause Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by the Mitchells, and theypretended to be quite surprised to see me out. I knew their spite: atone time they could not be civil to me, but now they are all friendship;but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them. You know I have apretty good spirit of my own. Anne Mitchell had tried to put on aturban like mine, as I wore it the week before at the concert, but madewretched work of it--it happened to become my odd face, I believe, atleast Tilney told me so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; buthe is the last man whose word I would take. I wear nothing but purplenow: I know I look hideous in it, but no matter--it is your dearbrother's favourite colour. Lose no time, my dearest, sweetestCatherine, in writing to him and to me, Who ever am, etc.Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine.Its inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck her from thevery first. She was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having everloved her. Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as herexcuses were empty, and her demands impudent. ""Write to James on herbehalf! No, James should never hear Isabella's name mentioned by heragain.""On Henry's arrival from Woodston, she made known to him and Eleanortheir brother's safety, congratulating them with sincerity on it, andreading aloud the most material passages of her letter with strongindignation. When she had finished it--""So much for Isabella,"" shecried, ""and for all our intimacy! She must think me an idiot, or shecould not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make hercharacter better known to me than mine is to her. I see what she hasbeen about. She is a vain coquette, and her tricks have not answered. Ido not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me, and Iwish I had never known her.""""It will soon be as if you never had,"" said Henry.""There is but one thing that I cannot understand. I see that she hashad designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do notunderstand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why shouldhe pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother, andthen fly off himself?""""I have very little to say for Frederick's motives, such as I believethem to have been. He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe, and thechief difference is, that, having a stronger head, they have not yetinjured himself. If the effect of his behaviour does not justify himwith you, we had better not seek after the cause.""""Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her?""""I am persuaded that he never did.""""And only made believe to do so for mischief's sake?""Henry bowed his assent.""Well, then, I must say that I do not like him at all. Though it hasturned out so well for us, I do not like him at all. As it happens,there is no great harm done, because I do not think Isabella has anyheart to lose. But, suppose he had made her very much in love with him?""""But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart tolose--consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in thatcase, she would have met with very different treatment.""""It is very right that you should stand by your brother.""""And if you would stand by yours, you would not be much distressed bythe disappointment of Miss Thorpe. But your mind is warped by an innateprinciple of general integrity, and therefore not accessible to the coolreasonings of family partiality, or a desire of revenge.""Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness. Frederick couldnot be unpardonably guilty, while Henry made himself so agreeable. Sheresolved on not answering Isabella's letter, and tried to think no moreof it."
Northanger Abbey,28,"CHAPTER 28Soon after this, the general found himself obliged to go to London fora week; and he left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessityshould rob him even for an hour of Miss Morland's company, and anxiouslyrecommending the study of her comfort and amusement to his childrenas their chief object in his absence. His departure gave Catherine thefirst experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain. Thehappiness with which their time now passed, every employment voluntary,every laugh indulged, every meal a scene of ease and good humour,walking where they liked and when they liked, their hours, pleasures,and fatigues at their own command, made her thoroughly sensible of therestraint which the general's presence had imposed, and most thankfullyfeel their present release from it. Such ease and such delights made herlove the place and the people more and more every day; and had it notbeen for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one, andan apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other, she would ateach moment of each day have been perfectly happy; but she was now inthe fourth week of her visit; before the general came home, the fourthweek would be turned, and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if shestayed much longer. This was a painful consideration whenever itoccurred; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind, she verysoon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once, propose going away,and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal mightbe taken.Aware that if she gave herself much time, she might feel it difficult tobring forward so unpleasant a subject, she took the first opportunity ofbeing suddenly alone with Eleanor, and of Eleanor's being in themiddle of a speech about something very different, to start forth herobligation of going away very soon. Eleanor looked and declared herselfmuch concerned. She had ""hoped for the pleasure of her company for amuch longer time--had been misled (perhaps by her wishes) to supposethat a much longer visit had been promised--and could not but think thatif Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to haveher there, they would be too generous to hasten her return."" Catherineexplained: ""Oh! As to that, Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all. Aslong as she was happy, they would always be satisfied.""""Then why, might she ask, in such a hurry herself to leave them?""""Oh! Because she had been there so long.""""Nay, if you can use such a word, I can urge you no farther. If youthink it long--""""Oh! No, I do not indeed. For my own pleasure, I could stay with you aslong again."" And it was directly settled that, till she had, her leavingthem was not even to be thought of. In having this cause of uneasinessso pleasantly removed, the force of the other was likewise weakened. Thekindness, the earnestness of Eleanor's manner in pressing her to stay,and Henry's gratified look on being told that her stay was determined,were such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left her onlyjust so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortablywithout. She did--almost always--believe that Henry loved her, and quitealways that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belongto them; and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties were merelysportive irritations.Henry was not able to obey his father's injunction of remaining whollyat Northanger in attendance on the ladies, during his absence in London,the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them onSaturday for a couple of nights. His loss was not now what it had beenwhile the general was at home; it lessened their gaiety, but did notruin their comfort; and the two girls agreeing in occupation, andimproving in intimacy, found themselves so well sufficient for the timeto themselves, that it was eleven o'clock, rather a late hour atthe abbey, before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry'sdeparture. They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed,as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge, that acarriage was driving up to the door, and the next moment confirmed theidea by the loud noise of the house-bell. After the first perturbationof surprise had passed away, in a ""Good heaven! What can be the matter?""it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her eldest brother, whosearrival was often as sudden, if not quite so unseasonable, andaccordingly she hurried down to welcome him.Catherine walked on to her chamber, making up her mind as well as shecould, to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney, and comfortingherself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her, andthe persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve ofher, that at least they should not meet under such circumstances aswould make their meeting materially painful. She trusted he would neverspeak of Miss Thorpe; and indeed, as he must by this time be ashamed ofthe part he had acted, there could be no danger of it; and as long asall mention of Bath scenes were avoided, she thought she could behaveto him very civilly. In such considerations time passed away, and it wascertainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him, andhave so much to say, for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival,and Eleanor did not come up.At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery, andlistened for its continuance; but all was silent. Scarcely, however,had she convicted her fancy of error, when the noise of something movingclose to her door made her start; it seemed as if someone was touchingthe very doorway--and in another moment a slight motion of the lockproved that some hand must be on it. She trembled a little at the ideaof anyone's approaching so cautiously; but resolving not to be againovercome by trivial appearances of alarm, or misled by a raisedimagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the door. Eleanor,and only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine's spirits, however, weretranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor's cheeks were pale, andher manner greatly agitated. Though evidently intending to come in, itseemed an effort to enter the room, and a still greater to speak whenthere. Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney's account,could only express her concern by silent attention, obliged her to beseated, rubbed her temples with lavender-water, and hung over her withaffectionate solicitude. ""My dear Catherine, you must not--you must notindeed--"" were Eleanor's first connected words. ""I am quite well.This kindness distracts me--I cannot bear it--I come to you on such anerrand!""""Errand! To me!""""How shall I tell you! Oh! How shall I tell you!""A new idea now darted into Catherine's mind, and turning as pale as herfriend, she exclaimed, ""'Tis a messenger from Woodston!""""You are mistaken, indeed,"" returned Eleanor, looking at her mostcompassionately; ""it is no one from Woodston. It is my father himself.""Her voice faltered, and her eyes were turned to the ground as shementioned his name. His unlooked-for return was enough in itself to makeCatherine's heart sink, and for a few moments she hardly supposedthere were anything worse to be told. She said nothing; and Eleanor,endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness, but with eyesstill cast down, soon went on. ""You are too good, I am sure, to thinkthe worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform. I am indeed a mostunwilling messenger. After what has so lately passed, so lately beensettled between us--how joyfully, how thankfully on my side!--as to yourcontinuing here as I hoped for many, many weeks longer, how can I tellyou that your kindness is not to be accepted--and that the happinessyour company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by--But I must nottrust myself with words. My dear Catherine, we are to part. My fatherhas recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away onMonday. We are going to Lord Longtown's, near Hereford, for a fortnight.Explanation and apology are equally impossible. I cannot attempteither.""""My dear Eleanor,"" cried Catherine, suppressing her feelings as well asshe could, ""do not be so distressed. A second engagement must giveway to a first. I am very, very sorry we are to part--so soon, and sosuddenly too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not. I can finish myvisit here, you know, at any time; or I hope you will come to me. Canyou, when you return from this lord's, come to Fullerton?""""It will not be in my power, Catherine.""""Come when you can, then.""Eleanor made no answer; and Catherine's thoughts recurring to somethingmore directly interesting, she added, thinking aloud, ""Monday--so soonas Monday; and you all go. Well, I am certain of--I shall be able totake leave, however. I need not go till just before you do, you know. Donot be distressed, Eleanor, I can go on Monday very well. My fatherand mother's having no notice of it is of very little consequence. Thegeneral will send a servant with me, I dare say, half the way--and thenI shall soon be at Salisbury, and then I am only nine miles from home.""""Ah, Catherine! Were it settled so, it would be somewhat lessintolerable, though in such common attentions you would have receivedbut half what you ought. But--how can I tell you?--tomorrow morning isfixed for your leaving us, and not even the hour is left to your choice;the very carriage is ordered, and will be here at seven o'clock, and noservant will be offered you.""Catherine sat down, breathless and speechless. ""I could hardly believemy senses, when I heard it; and no displeasure, no resentment thatyou can feel at this moment, however justly great, can be more than Imyself--but I must not talk of what I felt. Oh! That I could suggestanything in extenuation! Good God! What will your father and mother say!After courting you from the protection of real friends to this--almostdouble distance from your home, to have you driven out of the house,without the considerations even of decent civility! Dear, dearCatherine, in being the bearer of such a message, I seem guilty myselfof all its insult; yet, I trust you will acquit me, for you must havebeen long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistressof it, that my real power is nothing.""""Have I offended the general?"" said Catherine in a faltering voice.""Alas! For my feelings as a daughter, all that I know, all that Ianswer for, is that you can have given him no just cause of offence. Hecertainly is greatly, very greatly discomposed; I have seldom seen himmore so. His temper is not happy, and something has now occurred toruffle it in an uncommon degree; some disappointment, some vexation,which just at this moment seems important, but which I can hardlysuppose you to have any concern in, for how is it possible?""It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all; and it was only forEleanor's sake that she attempted it. ""I am sure,"" said she, ""I am verysorry if I have offended him. It was the last thing I would willinglyhave done. But do not be unhappy, Eleanor. An engagement, you know, mustbe kept. I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner, that I mighthave written home. But it is of very little consequence.""""I hope, I earnestly hope, that to your real safety it will be of none;but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence: to comfort,appearance, propriety, to your family, to the world. Were your friends,the Allens, still in Bath, you might go to them with comparative ease;a few hours would take you there; but a journey of seventy miles, to betaken post by you, at your age, alone, unattended!""""Oh, the journey is nothing. Do not think about that. And if we are topart, a few hours sooner or later, you know, makes no difference. Ican be ready by seven. Let me be called in time."" Eleanor saw that shewished to be alone; and believing it better for each that they shouldavoid any further conversation, now left her with, ""I shall see you inthe morning.""Catherine's swelling heart needed relief. In Eleanor's presencefriendship and pride had equally restrained her tears, but no sooner wasshe gone than they burst forth in torrents. Turned from the house, andin such a way! Without any reason that could justify, any apology thatcould atone for the abruptness, the rudeness, nay, the insolence ofit. Henry at a distance--not able even to bid him farewell. Every hope,every expectation from him suspended, at least, and who could say howlong? Who could say when they might meet again? And all this by sucha man as General Tilney, so polite, so well bred, and heretoforeso particularly fond of her! It was as incomprehensible as it wasmortifying and grievous. From what it could arise, and where it wouldend, were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm. The manner inwhich it was done so grossly uncivil, hurrying her away without anyreference to her own convenience, or allowing her even the appearanceof choice as to the time or mode of her travelling; of two days, theearliest fixed on, and of that almost the earliest hour, as if resolvedto have her gone before he was stirring in the morning, that hemight not be obliged even to see her. What could all this mean butan intentional affront? By some means or other she must have had themisfortune to offend him. Eleanor had wished to spare her from sopainful a notion, but Catherine could not believe it possible that anyinjury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a personnot connected, or, at least, not supposed to be connected with it.Heavily passed the night. Sleep, or repose that deserved the nameof sleep, was out of the question. That room, in which her disturbedimagination had tormented her on her first arrival, was again the sceneof agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers. Yet how different now thesource of her inquietude from what it had been then--how mournfullysuperior in reality and substance! Her anxiety had foundation infact, her fears in probability; and with a mind so occupied in thecontemplation of actual and natural evil, the solitude of her situation,the darkness of her chamber, the antiquity of the building, were feltand considered without the smallest emotion; and though the wind washigh, and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house,she heard it all as she lay awake, hour after hour, without curiosity orterror.Soon after six Eleanor entered her room, eager to show attention or giveassistance where it was possible; but very little remained to be done.Catherine had not loitered; she was almost dressed, and her packingalmost finished. The possibility of some conciliatory message from thegeneral occurred to her as his daughter appeared. What so natural, asthat anger should pass away and repentance succeed it? And she onlywanted to know how far, after what had passed, an apology might properlybe received by her. But the knowledge would have been useless here;it was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was put to thetrial--Eleanor brought no message. Very little passed between them onmeeting; each found her greatest safety in silence, and few and trivialwere the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs, Catherine inbusy agitation completing her dress, and Eleanor with more goodwill thanexperience intent upon filling the trunk. When everything was done theyleft the room, Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friendto throw a parting glance on every well-known, cherished object, andwent down to the breakfast-parlour, where breakfast was prepared. Shetried to eat, as well to save herself from the pain of being urged asto make her friend comfortable; but she had no appetite, and could notswallow many mouthfuls. The contrast between this and her last breakfastin that room gave her fresh misery, and strengthened her distaste foreverything before her. It was not four and twenty hours ago since theyhad met there to the same repast, but in circumstances how different!With what cheerful ease, what happy, though false, security, had shethen looked around her, enjoying everything present, and fearing littlein future, beyond Henry's going to Woodston for a day! Happy, happybreakfast! For Henry had been there; Henry had sat by her and helpedher. These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any addressfrom her companion, who sat as deep in thought as herself; and theappearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recallthem to the present moment. Catherine's colour rose at the sight of it;and the indignity with which she was treated, striking at that instanton her mind with peculiar force, made her for a short time sensible onlyof resentment. Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech.""You must write to me, Catherine,"" she cried; ""you must let me hear fromyou as soon as possible. Till I know you to be safe at home, I shallnot have an hour's comfort. For one letter, at all risks, all hazards, Imust entreat. Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safeat Fullerton, and have found your family well, and then, till I can askfor your correspondence as I ought to do, I will not expect more. Directto me at Lord Longtown's, and, I must ask it, under cover to Alice.""""No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I amsure I had better not write. There can be no doubt of my getting homesafe.""Eleanor only replied, ""I cannot wonder at your feelings. I will notimportune you. I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am ata distance from you."" But this, with the look of sorrow accompanyingit, was enough to melt Catherine's pride in a moment, and she instantlysaid, ""Oh, Eleanor, I will write to you indeed.""There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle,though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of. It had occurred to her thatafter so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided withmoney enough for the expenses of her journey, and, upon suggesting itto her with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to beexactly the case. Catherine had never thought on the subject till thatmoment, but, upon examining her purse, was convinced that but forthis kindness of her friend, she might have been turned from the housewithout even the means of getting home; and the distress in which shemust have been thereby involved filling the minds of both, scarcelyanother word was said by either during the time of their remainingtogether. Short, however, was that time. The carriage was soon announcedto be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and affectionateembrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu; and,as they entered the hall, unable to leave the house without some mentionof one whose name had not yet been spoken by either, she paused amoment, and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left""her kind remembrance for her absent friend."" But with this approach tohis name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings; and, hidingher face as well as she could with her handkerchief, she darted acrossthe hall, jumped into the chaise, and in a moment was driven from thedoor."
Northanger Abbey,29,"CHAPTER 29Catherine was too wretched to be fearful. The journey in itself had noterrors for her; and she began it without either dreading its length orfeeling its solitariness. Leaning back in one corner of the carriage, ina violent burst of tears, she was conveyed some miles beyond the wallsof the abbey before she raised her head; and the highest point of groundwithin the park was almost closed from her view before she was capableof turning her eyes towards it. Unfortunately, the road she nowtravelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passedalong in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles, everybitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects onwhich she had first looked under impressions so different. Every mile,as it brought her nearer Woodston, added to her sufferings, and whenwithin the distance of five, she passed the turning which led to it, andthought of Henry, so near, yet so unconscious, her grief and agitationwere excessive.The day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiestof her life. It was there, it was on that day, that the general had madeuse of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself, had sospoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of hisactually wishing their marriage. Yes, only ten days ago had heelated her by his pointed regard--had he even confused her by his toosignificant reference! And now--what had she done, or what had sheomitted to do, to merit such a change?The only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had beensuch as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge. Henry and her ownheart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idlyentertained; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each.Designedly, at least, Henry could not have betrayed her. If, indeed, byany strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence ofwhat she had dared to think and look for, of her causeless fanciesand injurious examinations, she could not wonder at any degree of hisindignation. If aware of her having viewed him as a murderer, she couldnot wonder at his even turning her from his house. But a justificationso full of torture to herself, she trusted, would not be in his power.Anxious as were all her conjectures on this point, it was not, however,the one on which she dwelt most. There was a thought yet nearer, a moreprevailing, more impetuous concern. How Henry would think, and feel,and look, when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard ofher being gone, was a question of force and interest to rise over everyother, to be never ceasing, alternately irritating and soothing; itsometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence, and at otherswas answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment. Tothe general, of course, he would not dare to speak; but to Eleanor--whatmight he not say to Eleanor about her?In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries, on any one articleof which her mind was incapable of more than momentary repose, the hourspassed away, and her journey advanced much faster than she looked for.The pressing anxieties of thought, which prevented her from noticinganything before her, when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston,saved her at the same time from watching her progress; and though noobject on the road could engage a moment's attention, she found no stageof it tedious. From this, she was preserved too by another cause, byfeeling no eagerness for her journey's conclusion; for to return in sucha manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meetingwith those she loved best, even after an absence such as hers--an elevenweeks' absence. What had she to say that would not humble herself andpain her family, that would not increase her own grief by the confessionof it, extend an useless resentment, and perhaps involve the innocentwith the guilty in undistinguishing ill will? She could never do justiceto Henry and Eleanor's merit; she felt it too strongly for expression;and should a dislike be taken against them, should they be thought ofunfavourably, on their father's account, it would cut her to the heart.With these feelings, she rather dreaded than sought for the first viewof that well-known spire which would announce her within twenty miles ofhome. Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger; butafter the first stage she had been indebted to the post-masters for thenames of the places which were then to conduct her to it; so greathad been her ignorance of her route. She met with nothing, however,to distress or frighten her. Her youth, civil manners, and liberalpay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself couldrequire; and stopping only to change horses, she travelled on forabout eleven hours without accident or alarm, and between six and seveno'clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton.A heroine returning, at the close of her career, to her native village,in all the triumph of recovered reputation, and all the dignity ofa countess, with a long train of noble relations in their severalphaetons, and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise and four,behind her, is an event on which the pen of the contriver may welldelight to dwell; it gives credit to every conclusion, and the authormust share in the glory she so liberally bestows. But my affair iswidely different; I bring back my heroine to her home in solitude anddisgrace; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness.A heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment, as noattempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand. Swiftly therefore shall herpost-boy drive through the village, amid the gaze of Sunday groups, andspeedy shall be her descent from it.But, whatever might be the distress of Catherine's mind, as she thusadvanced towards the parsonage, and whatever the humiliation of herbiographer in relating it, she was preparing enjoyment of no everydaynature for those to whom she went; first, in the appearance of hercarriage--and secondly, in herself. The chaise of a traveller beinga rare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were immediately at thewindow; and to have it stop at the sweep-gate was a pleasure to brightenevery eye and occupy every fancy--a pleasure quite unlooked for by allbut the two youngest children, a boy and girl of six and four years old,who expected a brother or sister in every carriage. Happy the glancethat first distinguished Catherine! Happy the voice that proclaimed thediscovery! But whether such happiness were the lawful property of Georgeor Harriet could never be exactly understood.Her father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at thedoor to welcome her with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awakenthe best feelings of Catherine's heart; and in the embrace of each, asshe stepped from the carriage, she found herself soothed beyond anythingthat she had believed possible. So surrounded, so caressed, she was evenhappy! In the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time wassubdued, and the pleasure of seeing her, leaving them at first littleleisure for calm curiosity, they were all seated round the tea-table,which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller,whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her notice, before any inquiry sodirect as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her.Reluctantly, and with much hesitation, did she then begin what mightperhaps, at the end of half an hour, be termed, by the courtesy of herhearers, an explanation; but scarcely, within that time, could theyat all discover the cause, or collect the particulars, of her suddenreturn. They were far from being an irritable race; far from anyquickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting, affronts: but here,when the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be overlooked, nor,for the first half hour, to be easily pardoned. Without suffering anyromantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter's long and lonelyjourney, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have beenproductive of much unpleasantness to her; that it was what they couldnever have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her on sucha measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably norfeelingly--neither as a gentleman nor as a parent. Why he had done it,what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality, and sosuddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actualill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from diviningas Catherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long;and, after a due course of useless conjecture, that ""it was a strangebusiness, and that he must be a very strange man,"" grew enough for alltheir indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in thesweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with youthfulardour. ""My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble,""said her mother at last; ""depend upon it, it is something not at allworth understanding.""""I can allow for his wishing Catherine away, when he recollected thisengagement,"" said Sarah, ""but why not do it civilly?""""I am sorry for the young people,"" returned Mrs. Morland; ""they musthave a sad time of it; but as for anything else, it is no matter now;Catherine is safe at home, and our comfort does not depend upon GeneralTilney."" Catherine sighed. ""Well,"" continued her philosophic mother, ""Iam glad I did not know of your journey at the time; but now it is allover, perhaps there is no great harm done. It is always good foryoung people to be put upon exerting themselves; and you know, my dearCatherine, you always were a sad little scatter-brained creature; butnow you must have been forced to have your wits about you, with so muchchanging of chaises and so forth; and I hope it will appear that youhave not left anything behind you in any of the pockets.""Catherine hoped so too, and tried to feel an interest in her ownamendment, but her spirits were quite worn down; and, to be silent andalone becoming soon her only wish, she readily agreed to her mother'snext counsel of going early to bed. Her parents, seeing nothing inher ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortifiedfeelings, and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey,parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away; andthough, when they all met the next morning, her recovery was not equalto their hopes, they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there beingany deeper evil. They never once thought of her heart, which, for theparents of a young lady of seventeen, just returned from her firstexcursion from home, was odd enough!As soon as breakfast was over, she sat down to fulfil her promise toMiss Tilney, whose trust in the effect of time and distance on herfriend's disposition was already justified, for already did Catherinereproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly, withhaving never enough valued her merits or kindness, and never enoughcommiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure. Thestrength of these feelings, however, was far from assisting her pen;and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing EleanorTilney. To compose a letter which might at once do justice to hersentiments and her situation, convey gratitude without servile regret,be guarded without coldness, and honest without resentment--a letterwhich Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of--and, above all,which she might not blush herself, if Henry should chance to see, was anundertaking to frighten away all her powers of performance; and, afterlong thought and much perplexity, to be very brief was all that shecould determine on with any confidence of safety. The money thereforewhich Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than gratefulthanks, and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart.""This has been a strange acquaintance,"" observed Mrs. Morland, as theletter was finished; ""soon made and soon ended. I am sorry it happensso, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; andyou were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella. Ah! Poor James! Well,we must live and learn; and the next new friends you make I hope will bebetter worth keeping.""Catherine coloured as she warmly answered, ""No friend can be betterworth keeping than Eleanor.""""If so, my dear, I dare say you will meet again some time or other; donot be uneasy. It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in thecourse of a few years; and then what a pleasure it will be!""Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation. The hopeof meeting again in the course of a few years could only put intoCatherine's head what might happen within that time to make a meetingdreadful to her. She could never forget Henry Tilney, or think of himwith less tenderness than she did at that moment; but he might forgether; and in that case, to meet--! Her eyes filled with tears as shepictured her acquaintance so renewed; and her mother, perceiving hercomfortable suggestions to have had no good effect, proposed, as anotherexpedient for restoring her spirits, that they should call on Mrs.Allen.The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart; and, as they walked,Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she felt on the score ofJames's disappointment. ""We are sorry for him,"" said she; ""but otherwisethere is no harm done in the match going off; for it could not bea desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not thesmallest acquaintance with, and who was so entirely without fortune; andnow, after such behaviour, we cannot think at all well of her. Just atpresent it comes hard to poor James; but that will not last forever; andI dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life, for the foolishnessof his first choice.""This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine couldlisten to; another sentence might have endangered her complaisance,and made her reply less rational; for soon were all her thinking powersswallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spiritssince last she had trodden that well-known road. It was not three monthsago since, wild with joyful expectation, she had there run backwardsand forwards some ten times a day, with an heart light, gay, andindependent; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed, andfree from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it. Threemonths ago had seen her all this; and now, how altered a being did shereturn!She was received by the Allens with all the kindness which herunlooked-for appearance, acting on a steady affection, would naturallycall forth; and great was their surprise, and warm their displeasure,on hearing how she had been treated--though Mrs. Morland's account ofit was no inflated representation, no studied appeal to their passions.""Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening,"" said she. ""Shetravelled all the way post by herself, and knew nothing of coming tillSaturday night; for General Tilney, from some odd fancy or other, allof a sudden grew tired of having her there, and almost turned her outof the house. Very unfriendly, certainly; and he must be a very oddman; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again! And it is a greatcomfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature, but can shiftvery well for herself.""Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonableresentment of a sensible friend; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressionsquite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself. Hiswonder, his conjectures, and his explanations became in succession hers,with the addition of this single remark--""I really have not patiencewith the general""--to fill up every accidental pause. And, ""I reallyhave not patience with the general,"" was uttered twice after Mr.Allen left the room, without any relaxation of anger, or any materialdigression of thought. A more considerable degree of wandering attendedthe third repetition; and, after completing the fourth, she immediatelyadded, ""Only think, my dear, of my having got that frightful great rentin my best Mechlin so charmingly mended, before I left Bath, that onecan hardly see where it was. I must show it you some day or other. Bathis a nice place, Catherine, after all. I assure you I did not above halflike coming away. Mrs. Thorpe's being there was such a comfort to us,was not it? You know, you and I were quite forlorn at first.""""Yes, but that did not last long,"" said Catherine, her eyes brighteningat the recollection of what had first given spirit to her existencethere.""Very true: we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe, and then we wanted fornothing. My dear, do not you think these silk gloves wear very well?I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms, youknow, and I have worn them a great deal since. Do you remember thatevening?""""Do I! Oh! Perfectly.""""It was very agreeable, was not it? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us, and Ialways thought him a great addition, he is so very agreeable. I have anotion you danced with him, but am not quite sure. I remember I had myfavourite gown on.""Catherine could not answer; and, after a short trial of other subjects,Mrs. Allen again returned to--""I really have not patience with thegeneral! Such an agreeable, worthy man as he seemed to be! I do notsuppose, Mrs. Morland, you ever saw a better-bred man in your life. Hislodgings were taken the very day after he left them, Catherine. But nowonder; Milsom Street, you know.""As they walked home again, Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on herdaughter's mind the happiness of having such steady well-wishers as Mr.and Mrs. Allen, and the very little consideration which the neglect orunkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have withher, while she could preserve the good opinion and affection of herearliest friends. There was a great deal of good sense in all this; butthere are some situations of the human mind in which good sense hasvery little power; and Catherine's feelings contradicted almost everyposition her mother advanced. It was upon the behaviour of these veryslight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended; andwhile Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by thejustness of her own representations, Catherine was silently reflectingthat now Henry must have arrived at Northanger; now he must have heardof her departure; and now, perhaps, they were all setting off forHereford."
Northanger Abbey,30,"CHAPTER 30Catherine's disposition was not naturally sedentary, nor had her habitsbeen ever very industrious; but whatever might hitherto have been herdefects of that sort, her mother could not but perceive them now to begreatly increased. She could neither sit still nor employ herself forten minutes together, walking round the garden and orchard again andagain, as if nothing but motion was voluntary; and it seemed as if shecould even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any timein the parlour. Her loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration. In herrambling and her idleness she might only be a caricature of herself; butin her silence and sadness she was the very reverse of all that she hadbeen before.For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint;but when a third night's rest had neither restored her cheerfulness,improved her in useful activity, nor given her a greater inclination forneedlework, she could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of, ""Mydear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do notknow when poor Richard's cravats would be done, if he had no friendbut you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time foreverything--a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You havehad a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.""Catherine took up her work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that""her head did not run upon Bath--much.""""Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simpleof you; for ten to one whether you ever see him again. You should neverfret about trifles."" After a short silence--""I hope, my Catherine, youare not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grandas Northanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed.Wherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at home,because there you must spend the most of your time. I did not quitelike, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French bread atNorthanger.""""I am sure I do not care about the bread. It is all the same to me whatI eat.""""There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon muchsuch a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home bygreat acquaintance--The Mirror, I think. I will look it out for you someday or other, because I am sure it will do you good.""Catherine said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, appliedto her work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing itherself, into languor and listlessness, moving herself in her chair,from the irritation of weariness, much oftener than she moved herneedle. Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing,in her daughter's absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of thatrepining spirit to which she had now begun to attribute her want ofcheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question,anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady. It was sometime before she could find what she looked for; and other family mattersoccurring to detain her, a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere shereturned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped. Heravocations above having shut out all noise but what she created herself,she knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes,till, on entering the room, the first object she beheld was a youngman whom she had never seen before. With a look of much respect, heimmediately rose, and being introduced to her by her conscious daughteras ""Mr. Henry Tilney,"" with the embarrassment of real sensibility beganto apologize for his appearance there, acknowledging that after what hadpassed he had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton, and statinghis impatience to be assured of Miss Morland's having reached her homein safety, as the cause of his intrusion. He did not address himself toan uncandid judge or a resentful heart. Far from comprehending him orhis sister in their father's misconduct, Mrs. Morland had been alwayskindly disposed towards each, and instantly, pleased by his appearance,received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence;thanking him for such an attention to her daughter, assuring him thatthe friends of her children were always welcome there, and entreatinghim to say not another word of the past.He was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though his heart wasgreatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at thatmoment in his power to say anything to the purpose. Returning in silenceto his seat, therefore, he remained for some minutes most civillyanswering all Mrs. Morland's common remarks about the weather androads. Catherine meanwhile--the anxious, agitated, happy, feverishCatherine--said not a word; but her glowing cheek and brightened eyemade her mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least sether heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did she lay aside thefirst volume of The Mirror for a future hour.Desirous of Mr. Morland's assistance, as well in giving encouragement,as in finding conversation for her guest, whose embarrassment on hisfather's account she earnestly pitied, Mrs. Morland had very earlydispatched one of the children to summon him; but Mr. Morland was fromhome--and being thus without any support, at the end of a quarter ofan hour she had nothing to say. After a couple of minutes' unbrokensilence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since hermother's entrance, asked her, with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs.Allen were now at Fullerton? And on developing, from amidst all herperplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllablewould have given, immediately expressed his intention of paying hisrespects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her if she wouldhave the goodness to show him the way. ""You may see the house from thiswindow, sir,"" was information on Sarah's side, which produced only abow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod fromher mother; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondaryconsideration in his wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that hemight have some explanation to give of his father's behaviour, which itmust be more pleasant for him to communicate only to Catherine, wouldnot on any account prevent her accompanying him. They began their walk,and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his object in wishing it.Some explanation on his father's account he had to give; but his firstpurpose was to explain himself, and before they reached Mr. Allen'sgrounds he had done it so well that Catherine did not think it couldever be repeated too often. She was assured of his affection; and thatheart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty equallyknew was already entirely his own; for, though Henry was now sincerelyattached to her, though he felt and delighted in all the excellenciesof her character and truly loved her society, I must confess that hisaffection originated in nothing better than gratitude, or, in otherwords, that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the onlycause of giving her a serious thought. It is a new circumstance inromance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine'sdignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wildimagination will at least be all my own.A very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random,without sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation ofher own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened her lips, dismissed themto the ecstasies of another tete-a-tete; and before it was suffered toclose, she was enabled to judge how far he was sanctioned by parentalauthority in his present application. On his return from Woodston, twodays before, he had been met near the abbey by his impatient father,hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland's departure, and orderedto think of her no more.Such was the permission upon which he had now offered her his hand.The affrighted Catherine, amidst all the terrors of expectation, as shelistened to this account, could not but rejoice in the kind cautionwith which Henry had saved her from the necessity of a conscientiousrejection, by engaging her faith before he mentioned the subject; andas he proceeded to give the particulars, and explain the motives ofhis father's conduct, her feelings soon hardened into even a triumphantdelight. The general had had nothing to accuse her of, nothing to layto her charge, but her being the involuntary, unconscious object of adeception which his pride could not pardon, and which a better pridewould have been ashamed to own. She was guilty only of being less richthan he had supposed her to be. Under a mistaken persuasion of herpossessions and claims, he had courted her acquaintance in Bath,solicited her company at Northanger, and designed her for hisdaughter-in-law. On discovering his error, to turn her from the houseseemed the best, though to his feelings an inadequate proof of hisresentment towards herself, and his contempt of her family.John Thorpe had first misled him. The general, perceiving his sonone night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to MissMorland, had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he knew more of herthan her name. Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a manof General Tilney's importance, had been joyfully and proudlycommunicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectationof Morland's engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved uponmarrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to represent thefamily as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had made himbelieve them. With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be connected, hisown consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as hisintimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their fortune.The expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the firstoverrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been graduallyincreasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of themoment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland'spreferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, andsinking half the children, he was able to represent the whole familyto the general in a most respectable light. For Catherine, however, thepeculiar object of the general's curiosity, and his own speculations,he had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousandpounds which her father could give her would be a pretty addition to Mr.Allen's estate. Her intimacy there had made him seriously determine onher being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to speak of her thereforeas the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturallyfollowed. Upon such intelligence the general had proceeded; for neverhad it occurred to him to doubt its authority. Thorpe's interest in thefamily, by his sister's approaching connection with one of its members,and his own views on another (circumstances of which he boasted withalmost equal openness), seemed sufficient vouchers for his truth; andto these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy andchildless, of Miss Morland's being under their care, and--as soon as hisacquaintance allowed him to judge--of their treating her with parentalkindness. His resolution was soon formed. Already had he discerned aliking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his son; and thankfulfor Mr. Thorpe's communication, he almost instantly determined to spareno pains in weakening his boasted interest and ruining his dearesthopes. Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of allthis, than his own children. Henry and Eleanor, perceiving nothing inher situation likely to engage their father's particular respect, hadseen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance, and extent of hisattention; and though latterly, from some hints which had accompanied analmost positive command to his son of doing everything in his power toattach her, Henry was convinced of his father's believing it to bean advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation atNorthanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculationswhich had hurried him on. That they were false, the general had learntfrom the very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whomhe had chanced to meet again in town, and who, under the influence ofexactly opposite feelings, irritated by Catherine's refusal, andyet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish areconciliation between Morland and Isabella, convinced that they wereseparated forever, and spurning a friendship which could be no longerserviceable, hastened to contradict all that he had said before tothe advantage of the Morlands--confessed himself to have been totallymistaken in his opinion of their circumstances and character, misled bythe rhodomontade of his friend to believe his father a man of substanceand credit, whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeksproved him to be neither; for after coming eagerly forward on the firstoverture of a marriage between the families, with the most liberalproposals, he had, on being brought to the point by the shrewdness ofthe relator, been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable ofgiving the young people even a decent support. They were, in fact, anecessitous family; numerous, too, almost beyond example; by no meansrespected in their own neighbourhood, as he had lately had particularopportunities of discovering; aiming at a style of life which theirfortune could not warrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthyconnections; a forward, bragging, scheming race.The terrified general pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiringlook; and here too Thorpe had learnt his error. The Allens, he believed,had lived near them too long, and he knew the young man on whom theFullerton estate must devolve. The general needed no more. Enraged withalmost everybody in the world but himself, he set out the next day forthe abbey, where his performances have been seen.I leave it to my reader's sagacity to determine how much of all thisit was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, howmuch of it he could have learnt from his father, in what points his ownconjectures might assist him, and what portion must yet remain to betold in a letter from James. I have united for their ease what they mustdivide for mine. Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that insuspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife,she had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his cruelty.Henry, in having such things to relate of his father, was almostas pitiable as in their first avowal to himself. He blushed for thenarrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to expose. The conversationbetween them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind. Henry'sindignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on comprehendinghis father's views, and being ordered to acquiesce in them, had beenopen and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary occasion togive the law in his family, prepared for no reluctance but of feeling,no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words, could illbrook the opposition of his son, steady as the sanction of reason andthe dictate of conscience could make it. But, in such a cause, hisanger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who wassustained in his purpose by a conviction of its justice. He felt himselfbound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believingthat heart to be his own which he had been directed to gain, no unworthyretraction of a tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiableanger, could shake his fidelity, or influence the resolutions itprompted.He steadily refused to accompany his father into Herefordshire, anengagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal ofCatherine, and as steadily declared his intention of offering her hishand. The general was furious in his anger, and they parted in dreadfuldisagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hourswere required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston,and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun his journey toFullerton."
Northanger Abbey,31,"CHAPTER 31Mr. and Mrs. Morland's surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney fortheir consent to his marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes,considerable, it having never entered their heads to suspect anattachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be morenatural than Catherine's being beloved, they soon learnt to consider itwith only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as theyalone were concerned, had not a single objection to start. His pleasingmanners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and havingnever heard evil of him, it was not their way to suppose any evil couldbe told. Goodwill supplying the place of experience, his characterneeded no attestation. ""Catherine would make a sad, heedless younghousekeeper to be sure,"" was her mother's foreboding remark; but quickwas the consolation of there being nothing like practice.There was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that onewas removed, it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement.Their tempers were mild, but their principles were steady, and whilehis parent so expressly forbade the connection, they could not allowthemselves to encourage it. That the general should come forward tosolicit the alliance, or that he should even very heartily approve it,they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation; butthe decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and that onceobtained--and their own hearts made them trust that it could not bevery long denied--their willing approbation was instantly to follow. Hisconsent was all that they wished for. They were no more inclined thanentitled to demand his money. Of a very considerable fortune, his sonwas, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his present income wasan income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view,it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter.The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this. Theyfelt and they deplored--but they could not resent it; and they parted,endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each believedalmost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them again inthe fullness of privileged affection. Henry returned to what was nowhis only home, to watch over his young plantations, and extend hisimprovements for her sake, to whose share in them he looked anxiouslyforward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry. Whether thetorments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence, letus not inquire. Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did--they had been too kindto exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter, as, atthat time, happened pretty often, they always looked another way.The anxiety, which in this state of their attachment must be the portionof Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to its finalevent, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who willsee in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we areall hastening together to perfect felicity. The means by which theirearly marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probablecircumstance could work upon a temper like the general's? Thecircumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter witha man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course ofthe summer--an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of goodhumour, from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtainedhis forgiveness of Henry, and his permission for him ""to be a fool if heliked it!""The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her removal from all the evils of sucha home as Northanger had been made by Henry's banishment, to the home ofher choice and the man of her choice, is an event which I expect togive general satisfaction among all her acquaintance. My own joy on theoccasion is very sincere. I know no one more entitled, by unpretendingmerit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoyfelicity. Her partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin;and he had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation fromaddressing her. His unexpected accession to title and fortune hadremoved all his difficulties; and never had the general loved hisdaughter so well in all her hours of companionship, utility, and patientendurance as when he first hailed her ""Your Ladyship!"" Her husband wasreally deserving of her; independent of his peerage, his wealth, andhis attachment, being to a precision the most charming young man in theworld. Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary; themost charming young man in the world is instantly before the imaginationof us all. Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only toadd--aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of acharacter not connected with my fable--that this was the verygentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection ofwashing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which myheroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures.The influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother's behalfwas assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland's circumstanceswhich, as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed, theywere qualified to give. It taught him that he had been scarcelymore misled by Thorpe's first boast of the family wealth than by hissubsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word werethey necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousandpounds. This was so material an amendment of his late expectations thatit greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride; and by nomeans without its effect was the private intelligence, which he was atsome pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely atthe disposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to everygreedy speculation.On the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor's marriage,permitted his son to return to Northanger, and thence made him thebearer of his consent, very courteously worded in a page full of emptyprofessions to Mr. Morland. The event which it authorized soon followed:Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and everybody smiled;and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of theirmeeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful delays occasioned bythe general's cruelty, that they were essentially hurt by it. To beginperfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen isto do pretty well; and professing myself moreover convinced that thegeneral's unjust interference, so far from being really injurious totheir felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving theirknowledge of each other, and adding strength to their attachment,I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether thetendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, orreward filial disobedience.*Vide a letter from Mr. Richardson, No. 97, Vol. II, Rambler.A NOTE ON THE TEXTNorthanger Abbey was written in 1797-98 under a different title.

Persuasion,0,PersuasionbyJane Austen(1818)
Persuasion,1,"Chapter 1Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; therehe found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressedone; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, bycontemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there anyunwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturallyinto pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creationsof the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, hecould read his own history with an interest which never failed.  Thiswas the page at which the favourite volume always opened:           ""ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.""Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county ofGloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, bornJune 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5,1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.""Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer'shands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information ofhimself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--""Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,"" and by inserting mostaccurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectablefamily, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions ofloyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, withall the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether twohandsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms andmotto:--""Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,"" andSir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--""Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of thesecond Sir Walter.""Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;vanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome inhis youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.  Few womencould think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor couldthe valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he heldin society.  He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only tothe blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who unitedthese gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect anddevotion.His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; sinceto them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to anything deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might bepardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had neverrequired indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, orconcealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability forseventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the worldherself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children,to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to herwhen she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldestsixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, anawful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of aconceited, silly father.  She had, however, one very intimate friend, asensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachmentto herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and onher kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best helpand maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she hadbeen anxiously giving her daughters.This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have beenanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years hadpassed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still nearneighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the othera widow.That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely wellprovided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs noapology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonablydiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; butSir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.  Be itknown then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with oneor two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.  Forone daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,which he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth hadsucceeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rightsand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, herinfluence had always been great, and they had gone on together mosthappily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.  Mary hadacquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs CharlesMusgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness ofcharacter, which must have placed her high with any people of realunderstanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had noweight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valuedgod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all; butit was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but herbloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father hadfound little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicatefeatures and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing inthem, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem. He hadnever indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name inany other page of his favourite work.  All equality of alliance mustrest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an oldcountry family of respectability and large fortune, and had thereforegiven all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day orother, marry suitably.It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than shewas ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has beenneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcelyany charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsomeMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Waltermight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, bedeemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as bloomingas ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for hecould plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintancewere growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in theneighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot aboutLady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding anddirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never havegiven the idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen yearshad she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law athome, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walkingimmediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms anddining-rooms in the country.  Thirteen winters' revolving frosts hadseen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhoodafforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelledup to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of thegreat world.  She had the remembrance of all this, she had theconsciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets andsome apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite ashandsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, andwould have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited bybaronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she againtake up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,but now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of herown birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left itopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, andpushed it away.She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especiallythe history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whoserights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointedher.She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant tomarry him, and her father had always meant that she should.  He had notbeen known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, SirWalter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had notbeen met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, makingallowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of theirspring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, MrElliot had been forced into the introduction.He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of thelaw; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in hisfavour was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talkedof and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.  Thefollowing spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; andthe next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing hisfortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, hehad purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman ofinferior birth.Sir Walter had resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that heought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man sopublicly by the hand; ""For they must have been seen together,"" heobserved, ""once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House ofCommons.""  His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very littleregarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself asunsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walterconsidered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them hadceased.This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval ofseveral years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man forhimself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strongfamily pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir WalterElliot's eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom herfeelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.  Yet somiserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this presenttime (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she couldnot admit him to be worth thinking of again.  The disgrace of his firstmarriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose itperpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse;but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, theyhad been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, mostslightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, andthe honours which were hereafter to be his own.  This could not bepardoned.Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the caresto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, theprosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelingsto give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, notalents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to beadded to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.  Sheknew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive theheavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of MrShepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property wasgood, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state requiredin its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; butwith her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period hehad been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him tospend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot wasimperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not onlygrowing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that itbecame vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from hisdaughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town;he had gone so far even as to say, ""Can we retrench?  Does it occur toyou that there is any one article in which we can retrench?"" andElizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposedthese two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to whichexpedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking nopresent down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But thesemeasures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the realextent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obligedto confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose ofdeeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did herfather; and they were neither of them able to devise any means oflessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, orrelinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could disposeof; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made nodifference.  He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had thepower, but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would neverdisgrace his name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmittedwhole and entire, as he had received it.Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in theneighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should bestruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments andreduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgenceof taste or pride."
Persuasion,2,"Chapter 2Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his holdor his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable promptedby anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, andonly begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellentjudgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fullyexpected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to seefinally adopted.Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave itmuch serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than ofquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in thisinstance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitousfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what wasdue to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.  She was abenevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and withmanners that were held a standard of good-breeding.  She had acultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value forrank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of thosewho possessed them.  Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave thedignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of hisclaims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliginglandlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne andher sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled toa great deal of compassion and consideration under his presentdifficulties.They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was veryanxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him andElizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,and she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne, whonever seemed considered by the others as having any interest in thequestion. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her inmarking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted toSir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of honestyagainst importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures, a more completereformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone ofindifference for everything but justice and equity.""If we can persuade your father to all this,"" said Lady Russell,looking over her paper, ""much may be done.  If he will adopt theseregulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be ableto convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectabilityin itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that thetrue dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in theeyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.  What willhe be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families havedone, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case; andit is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, asit always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  Wemust be serious and decided; for after all, the person who hascontracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to thefeelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,there is still more due to the character of an honest man.""This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to beproceeding, his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an actof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with allthe expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,and saw no dignity in anything short of it.  She wanted it to beprescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated Lady Russell's influencehighly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her ownconscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficultyin persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.  Herknowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that thesacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than ofboth, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentlereductions.How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of littleconsequence.  Lady Russell's had no success at all: could not be put upwith, were not to be borne. ""What! every comfort of life knocked off!Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions andrestrictions every where!  To live no longer with the decencies even ofa private gentleman!  No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.""""Quit Kellynch Hall.""  The hint was immediately taken up by MrShepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter'sretrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be donewithout a change of abode.  ""Since the idea had been started in thevery quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,"" he said, ""inconfessing his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did notappear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style ofliving in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancientdignity to support.  In any other place Sir Walter might judge forhimself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life inwhatever way he might choose to model his household.""Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more ofdoubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go wassettled, and the first outline of this important change made out.There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house inthe country.  All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.  A small housein their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell'ssociety, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimesseeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of herambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having somethingvery opposite from her inclination fixed on.  She disliked Bath, anddid not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home.Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd feltthat he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough todissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much saferplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be importantat comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath overLondon had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenientdistance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spendingsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction ofLady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been forBath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they shouldlose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.  Itwould be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house inhis own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found themortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter'sfeelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne'sdislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,first, from the circumstance of her having been three years at schoolthere, after her mother's death; and secondly, from her happening to benot in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwardsspent there with herself.Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it mustsuit them all; and as to her young friend's health, by passing all thewarm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spiritsgood.  Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her spiritswere not high.  A larger society would improve them.  She wanted her tobe more known.The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood forSir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a verymaterial part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on thebeginning.  He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in thehands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than SirWalter's have found too much.  Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This,however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their owncircle.Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known todesign letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word""advertise,"" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned theidea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hintbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on thesupposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some mostunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,that he would let it at all.How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russellhad another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that SirWalter and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth hadbeen lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after anunprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with the additionalburden of two children.  She was a clever young woman, who understoodthe art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have beenalready staying there more than once, in spite of all that LadyRussell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint ofcaution and reserve.Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, andseemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than becauseElizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more thanoutward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; hadnever succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, againstprevious inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest in tryingto get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all theinjustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shuther out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeththe advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always invain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it inmore decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of MrsClay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow heraffection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to herbut the object of distant civility.From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a veryunequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice ofmore suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore anobject of first-rate importance."
Persuasion,3,"Chapter 3""I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,"" said Mr Shepherd onemorning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, ""that thepresent juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will be turning allour rich naval officers ashore.  They will be all wanting a home.Could not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants,very responsible tenants.  Many a noble fortune has been made duringthe war.  If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter--""""He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,"" replied Sir Walter; ""that'sall I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him;rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so manybefore; hey, Shepherd?""Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--""I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a littleknowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confessthat they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to makedesirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that ifin consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; whichmust be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficultit is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from thenotice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, JohnShepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobodywould think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliothas eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; andtherefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surpriseme if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should getabroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, sinceapplications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from ourwealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leaveto add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you thetrouble of replying.""Sir Walter only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing theroom, he observed sarcastically--""There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who wouldnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.""""They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,""said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:  her father had driven herover, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive toKellynch: ""but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor mightbe a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of theprofession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and carefulin all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, ifyou chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in andabout the house would be taken such excellent care of!  The gardens andshrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.  Youneed not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens beingneglected.""""As to all that,"" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, ""supposing I were inducedto let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to theprivileges to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed tofavour a tenant.  The park would be open to him of course, and few navyofficers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range;but what restrictions I might impose on the use of thepleasure-grounds, is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of myshrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend MissElliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden.  I am verylittle disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinaryfavour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.""After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--""In all these cases, there are established usages which make everythingplain and easy between landlord and tenant.  Your interest, Sir Walter,is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me for taking care that no tenanthas more than his just rights.  I venture to hint, that Sir WalterElliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will befor him.""Here Anne spoke--""The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least anequal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all theprivileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough for theircomforts, we must all allow.""""Very true, very true.  What Miss Anne says, is very true,"" was MrShepherd's rejoinder, and ""Oh! certainly,"" was his daughter's; but SirWalter's remark was, soon afterwards--""The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see anyfriend of mine belonging to it.""""Indeed!"" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.""Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds ofobjection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons ofobscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours whichtheir fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as itcuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows oldsooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.  A man isin greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of onewhose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and ofbecoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any otherline.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men,striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose fatherwe all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I wasto give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the mostdeplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour ofmahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles,nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  'Inthe name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of minewho was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley).  'Old fellow!' cried SirBasil, 'it is Admiral Baldwin.  What do you take his age to be?''Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.' 'Forty,' replied Sir Basil,'forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall noteasily forget Admiral Baldwin.  I never saw quite so wretched anexample of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it isthe same with them all:  they are all knocked about, and exposed toevery climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen.  Itis a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reachAdmiral Baldwin's age.""""Nay, Sir Walter,"" cried Mrs Clay, ""this is being severe indeed.  Havea little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; Ihave observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then, is notit the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?  Soldiers,in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in the quieterprofessions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of thebody, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time.The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours,and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--"" she stopt amoment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--""and even theclergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and exposehis health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  Infact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession isnecessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those whoare not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in thecountry, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, andliving on their own property, without the torment of trying for more;it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a goodappearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what losesomething of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.""It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter'sgood will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted withforesight; for the very first application for the house was from anAdmiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company inattending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had receiveda hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.  By the report whichhe hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native ofSomersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishingto settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order tolook at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which,however, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing--(it was just ashe had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could notbe kept a secret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility ofKellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's)connection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order tomake particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty longconference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a manwho knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, inhis explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a mostresponsible, eligible tenant.""And who is Admiral Croft?"" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family, andmentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,added--""He is a rear admiral of the white.  He was in the Trafalgar action,and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, Ibelieve, several years.""""Then I take it for granted,"" observed Sir Walter, ""that his face isabout as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.""Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but notmuch, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; notlikely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted acomfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he mustpay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of thatconsequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walterhad asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of thedeputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimestook out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all thecircumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him peculiarlydesirable as a tenant.  He was a married man, and without children; thevery state to be wished for.  A house was never taken good care of, MrShepherd observed, without a lady: he did not know, whether furnituremight not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, aswhere there were many children.  A lady, without a family, was the verybest preserver of furniture in the world.  He had seen Mrs Croft, too;she was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost allthe time they were talking the matter over.""And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,""continued he; ""asked more questions about the house, and terms, andtaxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant withbusiness; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quiteunconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told meso herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back atMonkford. Bless me! what was his name? At this moment I cannotrecollect his name, though I have heard it so lately. Penelope, mydear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived atMonkford: Mrs Croft's brother?""But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did nothear the appeal.""I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember nogentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.""""Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman sowell by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, Iremember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's manbreaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in thefact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to anamicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!""After waiting another moment--""You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?"" said Anne.Mr Shepherd was all gratitude.""Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very man.  He hadthe curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for twoor three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.  Youremember him, I am sure.""""Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.  You misledme by the term gentleman.  I thought you were speaking of some man ofproperty:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected;nothing to do with the Strafford family.  One wonders how the names ofmany of our nobility become so common.""As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them noservice with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning, with allhis zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in theirfavour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they hadformed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage ofrenting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond thehappiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinarytaste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of SirWalter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with anevil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think theminfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highestterms, he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in thetreaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who stillremained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough of theworld to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials,than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.  So far went hisunderstanding; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing, inthe Admiral's situation in life, which was just high enough, and nottoo high.  ""I have let my house to Admiral Croft,"" would soundextremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--; a Mr (save,perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note ofexplanation.  An admiral speaks his own consequence, and, at the sametime, can never make a baronet look small.  In all their dealings andintercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence.Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but herinclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she was happy tohave it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word tosuspend decision was uttered by her.Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such anend been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener tothe whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for herflushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with agentle sigh, ""A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here."""
Persuasion,4,"Chapter 4He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, howeversuspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, hisbrother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off StDomingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, inthe summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for halfa year at Monkford.  He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man,with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne anextremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, forhe had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love; but theencounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.  They weregradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in theother, or which had been the happiest: she, in receiving hisdeclarations and proposals, or he in having them accepted.A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.Troubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actuallywithholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all thenegative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and aprofessed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.  He thought ita very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more temperedand pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throwherself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagementwith a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and nohopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertainprofession, and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in theprofession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she grieved tothink of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched offby a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him into astate of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence!  It must notbe, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations fromone who had almost a mother's love, and mother's rights, it would beprevented.Captain Wentworth had no fortune.  He had been lucky in his profession;but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.  Buthe was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour,he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station thatwould lead to everything he wanted.  He had always been lucky; he knewhe should be so still.  Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth,and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have beenenough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.  Hissanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently onher.  She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added adangerous character to himself.  He was brilliant, he was headstrong.Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching toimprudence a horror.  She deprecated the connexion in every light.Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne couldcombat.  Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possibleto withstand her father's ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind wordor look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she hadalways loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion,and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain.She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet,improper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it.  But it wasnot a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an endto it.  Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even morethan her own, she could hardly have given him up.  The belief of beingprudent, and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chiefconsolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and everyconsolation was required, for she had to encounter all the additionalpain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, andof his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He hadleft the country in consequence.A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;but not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it.  Herattachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment ofyouth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lastingeffect.More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowfulinterest had reached its close; and time had softened down much,perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been toodependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place(except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any noveltyor enlargement of society.  No one had ever come within the Kellynchcircle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as hestood in her memory.  No second attachment, the only thoroughlynatural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had beenpossible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste,in the small limits of the society around them.  She had beensolicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the youngman, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her youngersister; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrovewas the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and generalimportance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter's, and ofgood character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might haveasked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she would haverejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from thepartialities and injustice of her father's house, and settled sopermanently near herself.  But in this case, Anne had left nothing foradvice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with herown discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have theanxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by someman of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she heldher to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was neveralluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differentlyfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen.  She did not blameLady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, toapply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certainimmediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.  She was persuadedthat under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and everyanxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, anddisappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman inmaintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it;and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more thanthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as ithappened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could bereasonably calculated on.  All his sanguine expectations, all hisconfidence had been justified.  His genius and ardour had seemed toforesee and to command his prosperous path.  He had, very soon aftertheir engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her wouldfollow, had taken place.  He had distinguished himself, and earlygained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures,have made a handsome fortune.  She had only navy lists and newspapersfor her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, infavour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least, wereher wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerfulconfidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seemsto insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She had been forced intoprudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: thenatural sequel of an unnatural beginning.With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could nothear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynchwithout a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh,were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.  She often toldherself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficientlyto feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business noevil.  She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference andapparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends inthe secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection ofit.  She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motivesin this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour allthe better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivionamong them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in theevent of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anewover the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of thepast being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom nosyllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust thatamong his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, hadreceived any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brotherhad been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and,moreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on nohuman creature's having heard of it from him.The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying herhusband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary, had been atschool while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some,and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herselfand the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need notinvolve any particular awkwardness."
Persuasion,5,"Chapter 5On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing KellynchHall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to LadyRussell's, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found itmost natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeingthem.This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decidedthe whole business at once.  Each lady was previously well disposed foran agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in theother; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty goodhumour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral's side, ascould not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered intohis very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurancesof his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of goodbreeding.The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts wereapproved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and MrShepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been a singlepreliminary difference to modify of all that ""This indenture sheweth.""Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be thebest-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say,that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he shouldnot be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, withsympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back throughthe park, ""I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spiteof what they told us at Taunton.  The Baronet will never set the Thameson fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.""--reciprocalcompliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walterproposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, therewas no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of anyuse, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they weregoing to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she mightconvey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements ofher own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she wasunable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne though dreadingthe possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, andgrieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of theautumnal months in the country, did not think that, everythingconsidered, she wished to remain.  It would be most right, and mostwise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.  Mary, oftena little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her owncomplaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything wasthe matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have aday's health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for itwas hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear hercompany as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath.""I cannot possibly do without Anne,"" was Mary's reasoning; andElizabeth's reply was, ""Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobodywill want her in Bath.""To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at leastbetter than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to bethought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, andcertainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her owndear country, readily agreed to stay.This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties, andit was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath tillLady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should bedivided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled bythe wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her,which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter andElizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter inall the business before her.  Lady Russell was extremely sorry thatsuch a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved,and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay's beingof so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very soreaggravation.Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt theimprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.  With agreat deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she oftenwished less, of her father's character, she was sensible that resultsthe most serious to his family from the intimacy were more thanpossible.  She did not imagine that her father had at present an ideaof the kind.  Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and aclumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, inher absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking,and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners,infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal mighthave been.  Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, thatshe could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to hersister.  She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in theevent of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied thanherself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her forgiving no warning.She spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elizabeth could not conceive howsuch an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answeredfor each party's perfectly knowing their situation.""Mrs Clay,"" said she, warmly, ""never forgets who she is; and as I amrather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I canassure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularlynice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank morestrongly than most people.  And as to my father, I really should nothave thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for oursakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman,I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not thatanything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make adegrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Claywho, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerablypretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfectsafety.  One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of herpersonal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times.  That toothof her's and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very muchas they do him.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by afew, but he abominates them.  You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay'sfreckles.""""There is hardly any personal defect,"" replied Anne, ""which anagreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.""""I think very differently,"" answered Elizabeth, shortly; ""an agreeablemanner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on thispoint than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in youto be advising me.""Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless ofdoing good.  Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet bemade observant by it.The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath. The party drove off in very goodspirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all theafflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to showthemselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolatetranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell feltthis break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was asdear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious byhabit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and stillworse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escapethe solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be outof the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she had determinedto make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne.Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down atUppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back hadbeen completely in the old English style, containing only two housessuperior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; themansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trainedround its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it hadreceived the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, forhis residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, Frenchwindows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch thetraveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect andpremises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.Here Anne had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross aswell as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continuallymeeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other'shouse at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Maryalone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almosta matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Maryhad not Anne's understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, andproperly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;but any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources forsolitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliotself-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that offancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior toboth sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity ofbeing ""a fine girl."" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the prettylittle drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had beengradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and twochildren; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--""So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.  Iam so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature the wholemorning!""""I am sorry to find you unwell,"" replied Anne.  ""You sent me such agood account of yourself on Thursday!""""Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from wellat the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I havebeen all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and notable to ring the bell!  So, Lady Russell would not get out.  I do notthink she has been in this house three times this summer.""Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.  ""Oh!Charles is out shooting.  I have not seen him since seven o'clock.  Hewould go, though I told him how ill I was.  He said he should not stayout long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.  Iassure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.""""You have had your little boys with you?""""Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageablethat they do me more harm than good.  Little Charles does not mind aword I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.""""Well, you will soon be better now,"" replied Anne, cheerfully.  ""Youknow I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours at theGreat House?""""I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of themto-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through thewindow, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him howill I was, not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen tosuit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves outof their way.""""You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.  It isearly.""""I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal toomuch for me.  Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind ofyou not to come on Thursday.""""My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me ofyourself!  You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you wereperfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, youmust be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to thelast: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been sobusy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently haveleft Kellynch sooner.""""Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?""""A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect in amoment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making a duplicate of thecatalogue of my father's books and pictures.  I have been several timesin the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make himunderstand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell.  I havehad all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide,and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time whatwas intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary,of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, asa sort of take-leave.  I was told that they wished it.  But all thesethings took up a great deal of time.""""Oh! well!"" and after a moment's pause, ""but you have never asked meone word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.""""Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded youmust have been obliged to give up the party.""""Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matterwith me till this morning.  It would have been strange if I had notgone.""""I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasantparty.""""Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner willbe, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having acarriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were socrowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and MrMusgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into the backseat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that myillness to-day may be owing to it.""A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness onAnne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.  She could soon situpright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it bydinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other endof the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; andthen she was well enough to propose a little walk.""Where shall we go?"" said she, when they were ready.  ""I suppose youwill not like to call at the Great House before they have been to seeyou?""""I have not the smallest objection on that account,"" replied Anne.  ""Ishould never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know sowell as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.""""Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.  They oughtto feel what is due to you as my sister.  However, we may as well goand sit with them a little  while, and when we have that over, we canenjoy our walk.""Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neitherfamily could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly theywent, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughtersof the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by agrand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed inevery direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits against thewainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in bluesatin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such anoverthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves seemedto be staring in astonishment.The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,perhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old Englishstyle, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove were avery good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated,and not at all elegant.  Their children had more modern minds andmanners.  There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up,excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteenand twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stockof accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.  Their dress had everyadvantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremelygood, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequenceat home, and favourites abroad.  Anne always contemplated them as someof the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as weall are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing forthe possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own moreelegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied themnothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreementtogether, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had knownso little herself with either of her sisters.They were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss on theside of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very wellknew, the least to blame.  The half hour was chatted away pleasantlyenough; and she was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to havetheir walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary'sparticular invitation."
Persuasion,6,"Chapter 6Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removalfrom one set of people to another, though at a distance of only threemiles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, andidea.  She had never been staying there before, without being struck byit, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage inseeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which atKellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervadinginterest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must nowsubmit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our ownnothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; forcertainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject whichhad been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found inthe separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: ""So, MissAnne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do youthink they will settle in?"" and this, without much waiting for ananswer; or in the young ladies' addition of, ""I hope we shall be inBath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in agood situation:  none of your Queen Squares for us!"" or in the anxioussupplement from Mary, of--""Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off,when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!""She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and thinkwith heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having onesuch truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their ownhorses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fullyoccupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours,dress, dancing, and music.  She acknowledged it to be very fitting,that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters ofdiscourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of theone she was now transplanted into.  With the prospect of spending atleast two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her toclothe her imagination, her memory, and all her ideas in as much ofUppercross as possible.She had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive andunsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;neither was there anything among the other component parts of thecottage inimical to comfort.  She was always on friendly terms with herbrother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, andrespected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object ofinterest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he wasundoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all adangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe,with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improvedhim; and that a woman of real understanding might have given moreconsequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, andelegance to his habits and pursuits.  As it was, he did nothing withmuch zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, withoutbenefit from books or anything else.  He had very good spirits, whichnever seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness, bore withher unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon thewhole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which shehad sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by bothparties), they might pass for a happy couple.  They were alwaysperfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclinationfor a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, hehad the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that sucha present was not made, he always contended for his father's havingmany other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.As to the management of their children, his theory was much better thanhis wife's, and his practice not so bad.  ""I could manage them verywell, if it were not for Mary's interference,"" was what Anne oftenheard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening inturn to Mary's reproach of ""Charles spoils the children so that Icannot get them into any order,"" she never had the smallest temptationto say, ""Very true.""One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was herbeing treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being toomuch in the secret of the complaints of each house.  Known to have someinfluence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at leastreceiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.  ""I wish youcould persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,"" wasCharles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: ""I dobelieve if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there wasanything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would, you mightpersuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I everown.""Mary's declaration was, ""I hate sending the children to the GreatHouse, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for shehumours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so muchtrash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and crossfor the rest of the day.""  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunityof being alone with Anne, to say, ""Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishingMrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.  They arequite different creatures with you!  But to be sure, in general theyare so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way ofmanaging them.  They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen,poor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no morehow they should be treated--!  Bless me! how troublesome they aresometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see themat our house so often as I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles isnot quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it isvery bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checkingevery moment; ""don't do this,"" and ""don't do that;"" or that one canonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.""She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  ""Mrs Musgrove thinksall her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it inquestion; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upperhouse-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, aregadding about the village, all day long.  I meet them wherever I go;and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeingsomething of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiestcreature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tellsme, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them."" And on MrsMusgrove's side, it was, ""I make a rule of never interfering in any ofmy daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shalltell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights,that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hearstrange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my ownknowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she isenough to ruin any servants she comes near.  Mrs Charles quite swearsby her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon thewatch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid ofmentioning it.""Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not togive her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the GreatHouse with other families; and she did not see any reason why she wasto be considered so much at home as to lose her place.  And one daywhen Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them aftertalking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, ""I have noscruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are abouttheir place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent youare about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it wouldbe a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially ifshe would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would bemore becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.  It is not thatmamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is takennotice of by many persons.""How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She could do littlemore than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each tothe other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary betweensuch near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meantfor her sister's benefit.In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.  Herown spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removedthree miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having aconstant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family,since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employmentin the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.  Itwas certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met everymorning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believedthey should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and MrsMusgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without thetalking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, buthaving no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sitby and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thoughtof, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was wellaware.  She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only toherself; but this was no new sensation.  Excepting one short period ofher life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since theloss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, orencouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.  In music she hadbeen always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove'sfond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and totalindifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure fortheir sakes, than mortification for her own.The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited byeverybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitorsby invitation and by chance, than any other family.  They were morecompletely popular.The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,in an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins withina walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended onthe Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come at any time,and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very muchpreferring the office of musician to a more active post, played countrydances to them by the hour together; a kindness which alwaysrecommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrovemore than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--""Well done,Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!  how those littlefingers of yours fly about!""So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heartmust be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others; all theprecious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to ownother eyes and other limbs!  She could not think of much else on the29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the eveningfrom Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month,exclaimed, ""Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come toKellynch?  I am glad I did not think of it before.  How low it makesme!""The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to bevisited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.  ""Nobody knew howmuch she should suffer.  She should put it off as long as she could;""but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over onan early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state ofimaginary agitation, when she came back.  Anne had very sincerelyrejoiced in there being no means of her going.  She wished, however tosee the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.They came:  the master of the house was not at home, but the twosisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to theshare of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself veryagreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was wellable to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, tocatch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness,and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.  She hadbright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; thoughher reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of herhaving been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to havelived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrustof herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach tocoarseness, however, or any want of good humour.  Anne gave her credit,indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in allthat related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she hadsatisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even ofintroduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledgeor suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.  She wasquite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage,till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--""It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had thepleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.""Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotionshe certainly had not.""Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?"" added Mrs Croft.She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when MrsCroft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke,that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother. Sheimmediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should bethinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shameat her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of theirformer neighbour's present state with proper interest.The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, sheheard the Admiral say to Mary--""We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say youknow him by name.""He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging tohim like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being toomuch engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets,&c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he hadbegun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, thatthe same brother must still be in question.  She could not, however,reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whetheranything had been said on the subject at the other house, where theCrofts had previously been calling.The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day atthe Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits tobe made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when theyoungest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she was coming to apologize,and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was thefirst black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisamade all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave moreroom for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.""And I will tell you our reason,"" she added, ""and all about it.  I amcome on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits thisevening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard!And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuseher more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you why she is out ofspirits.  When the Crofts called this morning, (they called hereafterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother,Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, orsomething, and is coming to see them almost directly; and mostunluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, thatWentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard'scaptain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great whilebefore he died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over his letters andthings, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must bethe very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling uponsuch gloomy things.""The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached histwentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid andunmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at anytime by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heardof, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his deathabroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could forhim, by calling him ""poor Richard,"" been nothing better than athick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never doneanything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,living or dead.He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of thoseremovals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially suchmidshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months onboard Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from theLaconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the onlytwo letters which his father and mother had ever received from himduring the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only twodisinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications formoney.In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so littlewere they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant andincurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had madescarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should havebeen suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name ofWentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinarybursts of mind which do sometimes occur.She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and there-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor songone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, hadaffected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief forhim than she had known on first hearing of his death.  Mr Musgrove was,in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached thecottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anewon this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerfulcompanions could give them.To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his nameso often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that itmight, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same CaptainWentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after theircoming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not saywhether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial toAnne's nerves.  She found, however, that it was one to which she mustinure herself.  Since he actually was expected in the country, she mustteach herself to be insensible on such points.  And not only did itappear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in theirwarm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very highrespect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having beensix months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though notperfectly well-spelt praise, as ""a fine dashing felow, only twoperticular about the schoolmaster,"" were bent on introducingthemselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear ofhis arrival.The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening."
Persuasion,7,"Chapter 7A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be atKellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in hispraise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, bythe end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment to MrMusgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient washe to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his ownroof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in hiscellars.  But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne's reckoning, andthen, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that shecould feel secure even for a week.Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.  She and Marywere actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as sheafterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they werestopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home inconsequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation put the visitentirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference,even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt onhis account.His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received inthe back, as roused the most alarming ideas.  It was an afternoon ofdistress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary tosend for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother tosupport and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngestchild to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe;besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to theother house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened,enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care ofhis wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were theworse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson feltand felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to thefather and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to beable to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and thenit was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able sofar to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information ofCaptain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father andmother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were withhim, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought himthan any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at alla favourite before.  How glad they had been to hear papa invite him tostay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, andhow glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma'sfarther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on themorrow--actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant amanner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as heought.  And in short, he had looked and said everything with suchexquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were bothturned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, andapparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girlscame with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to makeenquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness abouthis heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there wouldbe now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorryto think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave thelittle boy, to give him the meeting.  ""Oh no; as to leaving the littleboy,"" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarmto bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not helpadding her warm protestations to theirs.Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; ""thechild was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced toCaptain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; hewould not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour."" Butin this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with ""Oh! no, indeed,Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anythingshould happen?""The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.  Itmust be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to thespine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and CharlesMusgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longerconfinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly aspossible; but what was there for a father to do?  This was quite afemale case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of nouse at home, to shut himself up.  His father very much wished him tomeet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason againstit, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, publicdeclaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dressdirectly, and dine at the other house.""Nothing can be going on better than the child,"" said he; ""so I told myfather, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right.Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.  Youwould not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.Anne will send for me if anything is the matter.""Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was quitedetermined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.  Shesaid nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon asthere was only Anne to hear--""So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sickchild; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!  I knew howit would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is anythingdisagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charlesis as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say it is veryunfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.  Talks ofhis being going on so well!  How does he know that he is going on well,or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?  I did notthink Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he is to go awayand enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to beallowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody elseto be about the child.  My being the mother is the very reason why myfeelings should not be tried.  I am not at all equal to it.  You sawhow hysterical I was yesterday.""""But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of theshock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall havenothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson'sdirections, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder atyour husband.  Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not hisprovince.  A sick child is always the mother's property:  her ownfeelings generally make it so.""""I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know thatI am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot bealways scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw,this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to beginkicking about.  I have not nerves for the sort of thing.""""But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the wholeevening away from the poor boy?""""Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is socareful; and she could send us word every hour how he was.  I reallythink Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.  Iam not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.  I wasdreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.""""Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charlesto my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remainwith him.""""Are you serious?"" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.  ""Dear me!  that'sa very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure, I may just as wellgo as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?  and it only harasses me.You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properestperson.  You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds youat a word.  It will be a great deal better than leaving him only withJemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite asmuch as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted withCaptain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.  Anexcellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles,and get ready directly.  You can send for us, you know, at a moment'snotice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothingto alarm you.  I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feelquite at ease about my dear child.""The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door,and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for the wholeconversation, which began with Mary's saying, in a tone of greatexultation--""I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home thanyou are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I shouldnot be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.  Anne willstay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.  It isAnne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a greatdeal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.""""This is very kind of Anne,"" was her husband's answer, ""and I should bevery glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should beleft at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.""Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of hermanner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was atleast very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being leftto dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her tolet him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and thisbeing the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set offtogether in high spirits.  They were gone, she hoped, to be happy,however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself,she was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, everlikely to be hers.  She knew herself to be of the first utility to thechild; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half amile distant, making himself agreeable to others?She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.  Perhapsindifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.  Hemust be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he wished ever to see heragain, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done whatshe could not but believe that in his place she should have done longago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alonehad been wanting.Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,and their visit in general.  There had been music, singing, talking,laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in CaptainWentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each otherperfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot withCharles.  He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, thoughthat had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to cometo the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in MrsCharles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet himto breakfast at his father's.Anne understood it.  He wished to avoid seeing her.  He had inquiredafter her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slightacquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged,actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when theywere to meet.The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of theother house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Maryand Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in tosay that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs,that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his sistersmeaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposingalso to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and thoughCharles had answered for the child's being in no such state as couldmake it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied withouthis running on to give notice.Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receivehim, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was themost consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.  Intwo minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared; they werein the drawing-room.  Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, acurtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all thatwas right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easyfooting; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a fewminutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready,their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with thesportsmen:  the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfastas she could.""It is over! it is over!"" she repeated to herself again and again, innervous gratitude.  ""The worst is over!""Mary talked, but she could not attend.  She had seen him.  They hadmet.  They had been once more in the same room.Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feelingless.  Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had beengiven up.  How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such aninterval had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might noteight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part of herown life.Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelingseight years may be little more than nothing.Now, how were his sentiments to be read?  Was this like wishing toavoid her?  And the next moment she was hating herself for the follywhich asked the question.On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not haveprevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the MissMusgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she hadthis spontaneous information from Mary:--""Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was soattentive to me.  Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when theywent away, and he said, 'You were so altered he should not have knownyou again.'""Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way,but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiarwound.""Altered beyond his knowledge.""  Anne fully submitted, in silent, deepmortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, forhe was not altered, or not for the worse.  She had already acknowledgedit to herself, and she could not think differently, let him think ofher as he would.  No:  the years which had destroyed her youth andbloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in norespect lessening his personal advantages.  She had seen the sameFrederick Wentworth.""So altered that he should not have known her again!""  These were wordswhich could not but dwell with her.  Yet she soon began to rejoice thatshe had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency; they allayedagitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier.Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, butwithout an idea that they would be carried round to her.  He hadthought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, hadspoken as he felt.  He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.  She had used himill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn afeebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confidenttemper could not endure.  She had given him up to oblige others.  Ithad been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been weakness andtimidity.He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a womansince whom he thought her equal; but, except from some naturalsensation of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.  Herpower with him was gone for ever.It was now his object to marry.  He was rich, and being turned onshore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properlytempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all thespeed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He had a heartfor either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, inshort, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting AnneElliot.  This was his only secret exception, when he said to hissister, in answer to her suppositions:--""Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.  Anybodybetween fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.  A little beauty,and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lostman.  Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no societyamong women to make him nice?""He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.  His bright proud eye spokethe conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of histhoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish tomeet with.  ""A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,"" made the firstand the last of the description.""That is the woman I want,"" said he.  ""Something a little inferior Ishall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more thanmost men."""
Persuasion,8,"Chapter 8From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in thesame circle.  They were soon dining in company together at MrMusgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer supply his auntwith a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginningof other dinings and other meetings.Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to theproof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection ofeach; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagementcould not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptionswhich conversation called forth.  His profession qualified him, hisdisposition lead him, to talk; and ""That was in the year six;"" ""Thathappened before I went to sea in the year six,"" occurred in the courseof the first evening they spent together: and though his voice did notfalter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wanderingtowards her while he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from herknowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance anymore than herself.  There must be the same immediate association ofthought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what thecommonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!  Now nothing!There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling thedrawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult tocease to speak to one another.  With the exception, perhaps, of Admiraland Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne couldallow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there couldhave been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings soin unison, no countenances so beloved.  Now they were as strangers;nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted.  Itwas a perpetual estrangement.When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout theparty; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two MissMusgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to themanner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., andtheir surprise at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodationand arrangement which was practicable, drew from him some pleasantridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had beenignorant, and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to beliving on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it ifthere were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper of MrsMusgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--""Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I daresay he would have been just such another by this time.""Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgroverelieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.When she could let her attention take its natural course again, shefound the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List (their own navylist, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting downtogether to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out theships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.""Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.""""You will not find her there.  Quite worn out and broken up.  I was thelast man who commanded her.  Hardly fit for service then.  Reported fitfor home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the WestIndies.""The girls looked all amazement.""The Admiralty,"" he continued, ""entertain themselves now and then, withsending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands thatmay just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them todistinguish the very set who may be least missed.""""Phoo! phoo!"" cried the Admiral, ""what stuff these young fellows talk!Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.  For an old builtsloop, you would not see her equal.  Lucky fellow to get her!  He knowsthere must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her atthe same time.  Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no moreinterest than his.""""I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;"" replied Captain Wentworth,seriously.  ""I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you candesire.  It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; avery great object, I wanted to be doing something.""""To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore forhalf a year together?  If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to beafloat again.""""But, Captain Wentworth,"" cried Louisa, ""how vexed you must have beenwhen you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.""""I knew pretty well what she was before that day;"" said he, smiling.""I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to thefashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent aboutamong half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and whichat last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.  Ah! she was a dearold Asp to me.  She did all that I wanted.  I knew she would.  I knewthat we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would bethe making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the timeI was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be veryentertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn,to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted.  I brought her intoPlymouth; and here another instance of luck.  We had not been six hoursin the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights,and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touchwith the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallantCaptain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of thenewspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thoughtabout me."" Anne's shudderings were to herself alone; but the MissMusgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamationsof pity and horror.""And so then, I suppose,"" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as ifthinking aloud, ""so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he metwith our poor boy. Charles, my dear,"" (beckoning him to her), ""do askCaptain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.  Ialways forgot.""""It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill atGibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to CaptainWentworth.""""Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid ofmentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure tohear him talked of by such a good friend.""Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,only nodded in reply, and walked away.The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth couldnot deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into hisown hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the littlestatement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class,observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends manever had.""Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I mademoney in her.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise togetheroff the Western Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!  You know how much hewanted money:  worse than myself.  He had a wife.  Excellent fellow.  Ishall never forget his happiness.  He felt it all, so much for hersake.  I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still thesame luck in the Mediterranean.""""And I am sure, Sir,"" said Mrs Musgrove, ""it was a lucky day for us,when you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget whatyou did.""Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only inpart, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts,looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.""My brother,"" whispered one of the girls; ""mamma is thinking of poorRichard.""""Poor dear fellow!"" continued Mrs Musgrove; ""he was grown so steady,and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!  Ah!it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.  I assureyou, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.""There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at thisspeech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsomemouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove'skind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to getrid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement tobe detected by any who understood him less than herself; in anothermoment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantlyafterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove weresitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation withher, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy andnatural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that wasreal and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readilymade room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.  It was noinsignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable,substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express goodcheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while theagitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be consideredas very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed somecredit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fatsighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessaryproportions.  A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deepaffliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fairor not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason willpatronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule willseize.The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the roomwith his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now cameup to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he mightbe interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with--""If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, youwould have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and herdaughters.""""Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then.""The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.  He defended himself;though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies onboard a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a fewhours might comprehend.""But, if I know myself,"" said he, ""this is from no want of gallantrytowards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with allone's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations onboard such as women ought to have.  There can be no want of gallantry,Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high,and this is what I do.  I hate to hear of women on board, or to seethem on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a familyof ladies anywhere, if I can help it.""This brought his sister upon him.""Oh! Frederick!  But I cannot believe it of you.--All idlerefinement!--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best housein England.  I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, andI know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  Ideclare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even atKellynch Hall,"" (with a kind bow to Anne), ""beyond what I always had inmost of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.""""Nothing to the purpose,"" replied her brother.  ""You were living withyour husband, and were the only woman on board.""""But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin, andthree children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was thissuperfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?""""All merged in my friendship, Sophia.  I would assist any brotherofficer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville'sfrom the world's end, if he wanted it.  But do not imagine that I didnot feel it an evil in itself.""""Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.""""I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number ofwomen and children have no right to be comfortable on board.""""My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what wouldbecome of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to oneport or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?""""My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and allher family to Plymouth.""""But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as ifwomen were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.  We none ofus expect to be in smooth water all our days.""""Ah! my dear,"" said the Admiral, ""when he had got a wife, he will singa different tune.  When he is married, if we have the good luck to liveto another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great manyothers, have done.  We shall have him very thankful to anybody thatwill bring him his wife.""""Ay, that we shall.""""Now I have done,"" cried Captain Wentworth.  ""When once married peoplebegin to attack me with,--'Oh! you will think very differently, whenyou are married.'  I can only say, 'No, I shall not;' and then they sayagain, 'Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it.""He got up and moved away.""What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!"" said Mrs Musgroveto Mrs Croft.""Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though manywomen have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and havebeen once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besidesbeing in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the WestIndies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.""Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuseherself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of herlife.""And I do assure you, ma'am,"" pursued Mrs Croft, ""that nothing canexceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of thehigher rates.  When you come to a frigate, of course, you are moreconfined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one ofthem; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has beenspent on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there wasnothing to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed withexcellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A littledisordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, butnever knew what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever reallysuffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myselfunwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed bymyself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the NorthSeas.  I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner ofimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when Ishould hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothingever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.""""Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,Mrs Croft,"" was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.  ""There is nothing so badas a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is, forMr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they areover, and he is safe back again.""The evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed, Anne offeredher services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill withtears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to beemployed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits thanCaptain Wentworth.  She felt that he had every thing to elevate himwhich general attention and deference, and especially the attention ofall the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females of thefamily of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to thehonour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, theyboth seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continuedappearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could havemade it credible that they were not decided rivals.  If he were alittle spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who couldwonder?These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingerswere mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,equally without error, and without consciousness.  Once she felt thathe was looking at herself,  observing her altered features, perhaps,trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmedhim; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardlyaware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of hishaving asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?  The answerwas, ""Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.  She had ratherplay.  She is never tired of playing.""  Once, too, he spoke to her.She had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had satdown to try to make out an air which he wished to give the MissMusgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally she returned to that part of theroom; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness--""I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;"" and though sheimmediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be inducedto sit down again.Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.  His coldpoliteness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything."
Persuasion,9,"Chapter 9Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long ashe liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternalkindness as of his wife's.  He had intended, on first arriving, toproceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled inthat country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put thisoff.  There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and ofeverything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were sohospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve toremain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections ofEdward's wife upon credit a little longer.It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.  The Musgroves couldhardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in themorning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and MrsCroft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves intheir new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling aboutin a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,lately added to their establishment.Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among theMusgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying, warm admirationeverywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established,when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good dealdisturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been aconsiderable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth'sintroduction.  He was in orders; and having a curacy in theneighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father'shouse, only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home hadleft his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,and of seeing Captain Wentworth.Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money, buttheir marriages had made a material difference in their degree ofconsequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it wasinsignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves werein the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would,from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living,and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class atall, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of courseexcepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who wasvery superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being nopride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such aconsciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made thempleased to improve their cousins.  Charles's attentions to Henriettahad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.""It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,""--and Henrietta did seem to like him.Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; butfrom that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yetquite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.  Henrietta wasperhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she knew notnow, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were mostlikely to attract him.Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entireconfidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all theyoung men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take itschance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remarkabout them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; andCaptain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the MissMusgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, whenAnne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as towhich was the one liked best.  Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary forHenrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could beextremely delightful.Charles ""had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what hehad once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he hadnot made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.  Here was afortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what mightbe done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was aslikely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.  Oh! itwould be a capital match for either of his sisters.""""Upon my word it would,"" replied Mary.  ""Dear me!  If he should rise toany very great honours!  If he should ever be made a baronet!  'LadyWentworth' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing, indeed, forHenrietta!  She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would notdislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!  It would be but a newcreation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.""It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the veryaccount of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put anend to.  She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thoughtit would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection betweenthe families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.""You know,"" said she, ""I cannot think him at all a fit match forHenrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,she has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young womanhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenientto the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections tothose who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is CharlesHayter?  Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for MissMusgrove of Uppercross.""Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides havinga regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he sawthings as an eldest son himself.""Now you are talking nonsense, Mary,"" was therefore his answer.  ""Itwould not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fairchance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop inthe course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that heis the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very prettyproperty.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred andfifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the bestland in the country.  I grant you, that any of them but Charles wouldbe a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; heis the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured,good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, hewill make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very differentsort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptibleman--good, freehold property.  No, no; Henrietta might do worse thanmarry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get CaptainWentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.""""Charles may say what he pleases,"" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as hewas out of the room, ""but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marryCharles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; andtherefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soonput him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that hehas.  She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.  I wishyou had been there to see her behaviour.  And as to Captain Wentworth'sliking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for hecertainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.  But Charles is sopositive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you mighthave decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did,unless you had been determined to give it against me.""A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these thingsshould have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under themixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indispositionin little Charles.  She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to theadvantages of a quiet evening.As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence thathe should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering thehappiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that heshould prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.  Either ofthem would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humouredwife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must bepained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and aheart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but ifHenrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, thealteration could not be understood too soon.Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in hiscousin's behaviour.  She had too old a regard for him to be so whollyestranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, andleave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross:  but therewas such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as CaptainWentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.  He had been absentonly two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, evento the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting hispresent curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had thenseemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, whofor more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the dutiesof his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, shouldbe quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite asgood as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise ofit.  The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead ofgoing six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a bettercuracy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good DrShirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer getthrough without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even toLouisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he cameback, alas!  the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could notlisten at all to his account of a conversation which he had just heldwith Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for CaptainWentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention togive, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitudeof the negotiation.""Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;I always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short, youknow, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.Is he coming, Louisa?""One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Annehad not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room atthe Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles,who was lying on the sofa.The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprivedhis manners of their usual composure:  he started, and could only say,""I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me Ishould find them here,"" before he walked to the window to recollecthimself, and feel how he ought to behave.""They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a fewmoments, I dare say,"" had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion thatwas natural; and if the child had not called her to come and dosomething for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment,and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, ""Ihope the little boy is better,"" was silent.She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfyher patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her verygreat satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the littlevestibule.  She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of thehouse; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matterseasy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sightof Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight ofAnne.She only attempted to say, ""How do you do?  Will you not sit down?  Theothers will be here presently.""Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently notill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end tohis attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up thenewspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.Another minute brought another addition.  The younger boy, a remarkablestout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened forhim by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, andwent straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in hisclaim to anything good that might be giving away.There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as hisaunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fastenhimself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she wasabout Charles, she could not shake him off.  She spoke to him, ordered,entreated, and insisted in vain.  Once she did contrive to push himaway, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her backagain directly.""Walter,"" said she, ""get down this moment.  You are extremelytroublesome.  I am very angry with you.""""Walter,"" cried Charles Hayter, ""why do you not do as you are bid?  Donot you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to cousinCharles.""But not a bit did Walter stir.In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of beingreleased from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bentdown her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastenedfrom around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knewthat Captain Wentworth had done it.Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.  Shecould not even thank him.  She could only hang over little Charles,with most disordered feelings.  His kindness in stepping forward to herrelief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the littleparticulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on herby the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant toavoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that herconversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion ofvarying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from,till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to makeover her little patient to their cares, and leave the room.  She couldnot stay.  It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves andjealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but she could stayfor none of it.  It was evident that Charles Hayter was not wellinclined towards Captain Wentworth.  She had a strong impression of hishaving said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth'sinterference, ""You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not toteaze your aunt;"" and could comprehend his regretting that CaptainWentworth should do what he ought to have done himself.  But neitherCharles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her,till she had a little better arranged her own.  She was ashamed ofherself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such atrifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitudeand reflection to recover her."
Persuasion,10,"Chapter 10Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enoughto have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; forwhile she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could notbut think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory andexperience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.  Theywere more in love with him; yet there it was not love.  It was a littlefever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love withsome.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henriettahad sometimes the air of being divided between them.  Anne longed forthe power of representing to them all what they were about, and ofpointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.  Shedid not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction to herto believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he wasoccasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner.He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims ofCharles Hayter.  He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (foraccepting must be the word) of two young women at once.After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit thefield.  Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross; amost decided change.  He had even refused one regular invitation todinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with somelarge books before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not beright, and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.It was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissalfrom Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence ofseeing him to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter waswise.One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworthbeing gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage weresitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sistersfrom the Mansion-house.It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came throughthe little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, thatthey were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary couldnot like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with somejealousy at not being supposed a good walker, ""Oh, yes, I should liketo join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;"" Anne feltpersuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely whatthey did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which thefamily habits seemed to produce, of everything being to becommunicated, and everything being to be done together, howeverundesired and inconvenient.  She tried to dissuade Mary from going, butin vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the MissMusgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, asshe might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening theinterference in any plan of their own.""I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a longwalk,"" said Mary, as she went up stairs.  ""Everybody is alwayssupposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have beenpleased, if we had refused to join them.  When people come in thismanner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?""Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had takenout a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly readyfor this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne haveforeseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from somefeelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was toolate to retract, and the whole six set forward together in thedirection chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered thewalk as under their guidance.Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where thenarrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keepwith her brother and sister.  Her pleasure in the walk must arise fromthe exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the yearupon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating toherself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant ofautumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mindof taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines offeeling.  She occupied her mind as much as possible in such likemusings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reachof Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimatefooting, might fall into.  He was more engaged with Louisa than withHenrietta.  Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than hersister.  This distinction appeared to increase, and there was onespeech of Louisa's which struck her.  After one of the many praises ofthe day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworthadded:--""What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant totake a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some ofthese hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.  Iwonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen veryoften, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would aslieve be tossed out as not.""""Ah! You make the most of it, I know,"" cried Louisa, ""but if it werereally so, I should do just the same in her place.  If I loved a man,as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing shouldever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than drivensafely by anybody else.""It was spoken with enthusiasm.""Had you?"" cried he, catching the same tone; ""I honour you!"" And therewas silence between them for a little while.Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweetscenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declininghappiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gonetogether, blessed her memory.  She roused herself to say, as theystruck by order into another path, ""Is not this one of the ways toWinthrop?"" But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes to bemet with, strolling about near home--was their destination; and afteranother half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where theploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteractingthe sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again,they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which partedUppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter,at the foot of the hill on the other side.Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns andbuildings of a farm-yard.Mary exclaimed, ""Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.""Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walkingalong any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Marywished; but ""No!"" said Charles Musgrove, and ""No, no!"" cried Louisamore eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be arguing thematter warmly.Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolutionof calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.  But thiswas one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and whenhe recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour atWinthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered, ""Oh! no,indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than anysitting down could do her good;"" and, in short, her look and mannerdeclared, that go she would not.After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he andHenrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt andcousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of thehill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as shewent a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta,Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her, and sayingto Captain Wentworth--""It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you, Ihave never been in the house above twice in my life.""She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anneperfectly knew the meaning of.The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisareturned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the stepof a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stoodabout her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for agleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone bydegrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; shequarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much bettersomewhere, and nothing could prevent her from going to look for abetter also.  She turned through the same gate, but could not see them.Anne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under thehedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spotor other.  Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she wassure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go ontill she overtook her.Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soonheard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as ifmaking their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down thecentre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa's voice was thefirst distinguished.  She seemed to be in the middle of some eagerspeech.  What Anne first heard was--""And so, I made her go.  I could not bear that she should be frightenedfrom the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back fromdoing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I maysay?  No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I havemade up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to havemade up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as neargiving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!""""She would have turned back then, but for you?""""She would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it.""""Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hintsyou gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the lasttime I was in company with him,  I need not affect to have nocomprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than a mere dutifulmorning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and hertoo, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed incircumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have notresolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character ofdecision and firmness, I see.  If you value her conduct or happiness,infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can.  But this, nodoubt, you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of tooyielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can bedepended on.  You are never sure of a good impression being durable;everybody may sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here isa nut,"" said he, catching one down from an upper bough, ""to exemplify:a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, hasoutlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not a weak spotanywhere.  This nut,"" he continued, with playful solemnity, ""while somany of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is stillin possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposedcapable of.""  Then returning to his former earnest tone--""My firstwish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.  IfLouisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,she will cherish all her present powers of mind.""He had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne ifLouisa could have readily answered such a speech:  words of suchinterest, spoken with such serious warmth!  She could imagine whatLouisa was feeling.  For herself, she feared to move, lest she shouldbe seen.  While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protectedher, and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her hearing,however, Louisa spoke again.""Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,"" said she; ""but she doessometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliotpride.  She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.  We do sowish that Charles had married Anne instead.  I suppose you know hewanted to marry Anne?""After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--""Do you mean that she refused him?""""Oh! yes; certainly.""""When did that happen?""""I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;but I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she hadaccepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better; andpapa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell'sdoing, that she did not.  They think Charles might not be learned andbookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, shepersuaded Anne to refuse him.""The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.  Her ownemotions still kept her fixed.  She had much to recover from, beforeshe could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutelyhers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great dealof very painful import.  She saw how her own character was consideredby Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feelingand curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extremeagitation.As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walkedback with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfortin their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and oncemore in motion together.  Her spirits wanted the solitude and silencewhich only numbers could give.Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,Charles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne could notattempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted toperfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on thegentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they were nowvery glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.  Henriettalooked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles Hayterexceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other almost from thefirst instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing couldbe plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where theywere not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.  Ina long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, theywere thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party ofthe three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Annenecessarily belonged.  She joined Charles and Mary, and was tiredenough to be very glad of Charles's other arm; but Charles, though invery good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife.  Mary hadshewn herself disobliging to him, and was now to reap the consequence,which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cutoff the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and whenMary began to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, accordingto custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommodedon the other, he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel whichhe had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along atall.This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end ofit was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some timeheard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.  Heand his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, theykindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; itwould save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.The invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroveswere not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being askedbefore any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride couldnot endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting anopposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say somethingto his sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.""Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,"" cried Mrs Croft.  ""Do let ushave the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room forthree, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might sitfour.  You must, indeed, you must.""Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning todecline, she was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgencycame in support of his wife's; they would not be refused; theycompressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her acorner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her,and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.Yes; he had done it.  She was in the carriage, and felt that he hadplaced her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that sheowed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution to giveher rest.  She was very much affected by the view of his dispositiontowards her, which all these things made apparent.  This littlecircumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.  Sheunderstood him.  He could not forgive her, but he could not beunfeeling.  Though condemning her for the past, and considering it withhigh and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, andthough becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer,without the desire of giving her relief.  It was a remainder of formersentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship;it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could notcontemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, thatshe knew not which prevailed.Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were atfirst unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way along therough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.  She thenfound them talking of ""Frederick.""""He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,""said the Admiral; ""but there is no saying which.  He has been runningafter them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.Ay, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he would have settledit long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make longcourtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear, between thefirst time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in ourlodgings at North Yarmouth?""""We had better not talk about it, my dear,"" replied Mrs Croft,pleasantly; ""for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to anunderstanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happytogether.  I had known you by character, however, long before.""""Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were weto wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us homeone of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always becompany for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardlyknow one from the other.""""Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,"" said Mrs Croft, in atone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powersmight not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; ""anda very respectable family.  One could not be connected with betterpeople.  My dear Admiral, that post!  we shall certainly take thatpost.""But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happilypassed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out herhand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; andAnne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imaginedno bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, foundherself safely deposited by them at the Cottage."
Persuasion,11,"Chapter 11The time now approached for Lady Russell's return:  the day was evenfixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she wasresettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, andbeginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, withinhalf a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, andthere must be intercourse between the two families.  This was againsther; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross,that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving himbehind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believedshe must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost ascertainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Maryfor Lady Russell.She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing CaptainWentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed former meetings whichwould be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxiousfor the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meetinganywhere.  They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintancenow could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, shemight think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little.These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removalfrom Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite longenough.  Her usefulness to little Charles would always give somesweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there, but he wasgaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way whichshe had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen andunheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among themto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out atlast, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled withhis family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quiteunknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville hadnever been in good health since a severe wound which he received twoyears before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him had determinedhim to go immediately to Lyme.  He had been there for four-and-twentyhours.  His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, alively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the finecountry about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that anearnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thitherwas the consequence.The young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talkedof going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles fromUppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, inshort, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed theresolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, beingnow armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore downall the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer;and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa,and Captain Wentworth.The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return atnight; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would notconsent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in themiddle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, forgoing and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.  This was feltto be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the GreatHouse at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coachcontaining the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which he droveCaptain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, andentering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it wasvery evident they would not have more than time for looking about them,before the light and warmth of the day were gone.After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of theinns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directlydown to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusementor variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms wereshut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of theresidents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildingsthemselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal streetalmost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting roundthe pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathingmachines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and newimprovements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out tothe east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a verystrange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediateenvirons of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.  The scenes inits neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensivesweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed bydark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it thehappiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting inunwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village ofUp Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romanticrocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriantgrowth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since thefirst partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such astate, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as maymore than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle ofWight:  these places must be visited, and visited again, to make theworth of Lyme understood.The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted andmelancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselveson the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on afirst return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and onCaptain Wentworth's account:  for in a small house, near the foot of anold pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.  CaptainWentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and hewas to join them on the Cobb.They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not evenLouisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all wellknown already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and aCaptain Benwick, who was staying with them.Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his returnfrom Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man andan officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stampedhim well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a littlehistory of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interestingin the eyes of all the ladies.  He had been engaged to CaptainHarville's sister, and was now mourning her loss.  They had been a yearor two waiting for fortune and promotion.  Fortune came, hisprize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last;but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.  She had died the precedingsummer while he was at sea.  Captain Wentworth believed it impossiblefor man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been toFanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadfulchange.  He considered his disposition as of the sort which must sufferheavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiringmanners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits.  Tofinish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and theHarvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed alltheir views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with thementirely.  Captain Harville had taken his present house for half ayear; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him toa residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of thecountry, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactlyadapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind.  The sympathy and good-willexcited towards Captain Benwick was very great.""And yet,"" said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet theparty, ""he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.  Icannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.  He is younger thanI am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man.  He willrally again, and be happy with another.""They all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall, darkman, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and fromstrong features and want of health, looking much older than CaptainWentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,and, compared with either of them, a little man.  He had a pleasingface and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back fromconversation.Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.  Mrs Harville,a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have thesame good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than theirdesire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, becausethe friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than theirentreaties for their all promising to dine with them.  The dinner,already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, acceptedas a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth shouldhave brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thingof course that they should dine with them.There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and sucha bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlikethe usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formalityand display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited byan increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.  ""These wouldhave been all my friends,"" was her thought; and she had to struggleagainst a great tendency to lowness.On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heartcould think capable of accommodating so many.  Anne had a moment'sastonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in thepleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingeniouscontrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn theactual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies oflodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against thewinter storms to be expected.  The varieties in the fitting-up of therooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in thecommon indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of arare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curiousand valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville hadvisited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was withhis profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influenceon his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness itpresented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellentaccommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerablecollection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.  Hislameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind ofusefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employmentwithin.  He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toysfor the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins withimprovements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his largefishing-net at one corner of the room.Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted thehouse; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth intoraptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; theirfriendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness;protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth andwarmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how tolive, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answeredalready, that nothing was found amiss; though its being ""so entirelyout of season,"" and the ""no thoroughfare of Lyme,"" and the ""noexpectation of company,"" had brought many apologies from the heads ofthe inn.Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to beingin Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined couldever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and theinterchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never gotbeyond), was become a mere nothing.The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and hecame, bringing his friend also, which was more than had been expected,it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance ofbeing oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.  He venturedamong them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seemfit for the mirth of the party in general.While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of theroom, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundanceto occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placedrather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of hernature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.  He was shy, anddisposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance,and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was wellrepaid the first trouble of exertion.  He was evidently a young man ofconsiderable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; andbesides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening'sindulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companionshad probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use tohim in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of strugglingagainst affliction, which had naturally grown out of theirconversation.  For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had ratherthe appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; andhaving talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gonethrough a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets,trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to bepreferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; andmoreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed himself sointimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, andall the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; herepeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged abroken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked soentirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope hedid not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it wasthe misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those whoenjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone couldestimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it butsparingly.His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion to hissituation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself theright of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a largerallowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested toparticularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, suchcollections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worthand suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouseand fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongestexamples of moral and religious endurances.Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for theinterest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs whichdeclared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief likehis, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised toprocure and read them.When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea ofher coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young manwhom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing, on moreserious reflection, that, like many other great moralists andpreachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conductwould ill bear examination."
Persuasion,12,"Chapter 12Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party thenext morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.  Theywent to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a finesouth-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which soflat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning; gloried in the sea;sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze--and weresilent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--""Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, thesea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been ofthe greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last springtwelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month,did him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by thesea, always makes him feel young again.  Now, I cannot help thinking ita pity that he does not live entirely by the sea.  I do think he hadbetter leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne?Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, bothfor himself and Mrs Shirley?  She has cousins here, you know, and manyacquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure shewould be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendanceat hand, in case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think itquite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley,who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last daysin a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shutout from all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.  Ireally think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation, therecould be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.  Myonly doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous Imust say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?  Do notyou think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergymansacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as wellperformed by another person?  And at Lyme too, only seventeen milesoff, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there wasanything to complain of.""Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and enteredinto the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings ofa young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lowerstandard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?  She saidall that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims ofDr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was thathe should have some active, respectable young man, as a residentcurate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of suchresident curate's being married.""I wish,"" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, ""I wishLady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley.  Ihave always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influencewith everybody!  I always look upon her as able to persuade a person toanything!  I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraidof her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, andwish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross.""Anne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful, and amusedalso that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta'sviews should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of theMusgrove family; she had only time, however, for a general answer, anda wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjectssuddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towardsthem.  They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to beready; but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she hadsomething to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with herinto the town.  They were all at her disposal.When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, agentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drewback, and stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed him; andas they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her with adegree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very prettyfeatures, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the finewind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation ofeye which it had also produced.  It was evident that the gentleman,(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.  CaptainWentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed hisnoticing of it.  He gave her a momentary glance, a glance ofbrightness, which seemed to say, ""That man is struck with you, and evenI, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.""After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about alittle longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passingafterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, hadnearly run against the very same gentleman, as he came out of anadjoining apartment.  She had before conjectured him to be a strangerlike themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who wasstrolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be hisservant.  Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.  Itwas now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and thissecond meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman'slooks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness andpropriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly goodmanners.  He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had anagreeable person.  Anne felt that she should like to know who he was.They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almostthe first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party tothe window.  It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle, but only cominground from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be goingaway.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compareit with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity, andthe whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of thecurricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows andcivilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.""Ah!"" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance atAnne, ""it is the very man we passed.""The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him asfar up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.""Pray,"" said Captain Wentworth, immediately, ""can you tell us the nameof the gentleman who is just gone away?""""Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in lastnight from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while youwere at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath andLondon.""""Elliot!""  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated thename, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidityof a waiter.""Bless me!"" cried Mary; ""it must be our cousin; it must be our MrElliot, it must, indeed!  Charles, Anne, must not it?  In mourning, yousee, just as our Mr Elliot must be.  How very extraordinary!  In thevery same inn with us!  Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?  myfather's next heir?  Pray sir,"" turning to the waiter, ""did not youhear, did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynchfamily?""""No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said hismaster was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.""""There! you see!"" cried Mary in an ecstasy, ""just as I said!  Heir toSir Walter Elliot!  I was sure that would come out, if it was so.Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care topublish, wherever he goes.  But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary!I wish I had looked at him more.  I wish we had been aware in time, whoit was, that he might have been introduced to us.  What a pity that weshould not have been introduced to each other!  Do you think he had theElliot countenance?  I hardly looked at him, I was looking at thehorses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, Iwonder the arms did not strike me!  Oh! the great-coat was hanging overthe panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I shouldhave observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been inmourning, one should have known him by the livery.""""Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,"" saidCaptain Wentworth, ""we must consider it to be the arrangement ofProvidence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.""When she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried to convinceher that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years, been onsuch terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at alldesirable.At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself tohave seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch wasundoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.  She would not,upon any account, mention her having met with him the second time;luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him intheir earlier walk, but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne'shaving actually run against him in the passage, and received his verypolite excuses, while she had never been near him at all; no, thatcousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret.""Of course,"" said Mary, ""you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, thenext time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly ought to hearof it; do mention all about him.""Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which sheconsidered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as whatought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given her father,many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it shesuspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in bothwas beyond a doubt.  Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil ofkeeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fellon Anne.Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain andMrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to taketheir last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off forUppercross by one, and in the meanwhile were to be all together, andout of doors as long as they could.Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were allfairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening did notdisincline him to seek her again; and they walked together some time,talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable asbefore, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alikeof the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost generalchange amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she hadCaptain Harville by her side.""Miss Elliot,"" said he, speaking rather low, ""you have done a good deedin making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish he could have suchcompany oftener.  It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is;but what can we do?  We cannot part.""""No,"" said Anne, ""that I can easily believe to be impossible; but intime, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, andyou must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be calleda young mourner--only last summer, I understand.""""Ay, true enough,"" (with a deep sigh) ""only June.""""And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.""""Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,just made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear ofhim; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders forPortsmouth.  There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it?not I.  I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody coulddo it, but that good fellow"" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  ""TheLaconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her beingsent to sea again.  He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up forleave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night andday till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant,and never left the poor fellow for a week.  That's what he did, andnobody else could have saved poor James.  You may think, Miss Elliot,whether he is dear to us!""Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as muchin reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able tobear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when hespoke again, it was of something totally different.Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would havequite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined thedirection of all the party in what was to be their last walk; theywould accompany them to their door, and then return and set offthemselves.  By all their calculations there was just time for this;but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walkalong it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew sodetermined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, andall the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may beimagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door,and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to themto the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb.Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.  Lord Byron's ""darkblue seas"" could not fail of being brought forward by their presentview, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attentionwas possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasantfor the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, andall were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; thesensation was delightful to her.  The hardness of the pavement for herfeet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it,however.  She was safely down, and instantly, to show her enjoyment,ran up the steps to be jumped down again.  He advised her against it,thought the jar too great; but no, he reasoned and talked in vain, shesmiled and said, ""I am determined I will:"" he put out his hands; shewas too precipitate by half a second, she fell on the pavement on theLower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!  There was no wound, no blood,no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her facewas like death.  The horror of the moment to all who stood around!Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony ofsilence.  ""She is dead! she is dead!"" screamed Mary, catching hold ofher husband, and contributing with his own horror to make himimmoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under theconviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps,but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her betweenthem.""Is there no one to help me?"" were the first words which burst fromCaptain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all his own strengthwere gone.""Go to him, go to him,"" cried Anne, ""for heaven's sake go to him.  Ican support her myself.  Leave me, and go to him.  Rub her hands, rubher temples; here are salts; take them, take them.""Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaginghimself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raisedup and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done thatAnne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggeringagainst the wall for his support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony--""Oh God! her father and mother!""""A surgeon!"" said Anne.He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--""True, true, a surgeon this instant,"" was darting away, when Anneeagerly suggested--""Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?  He knowswhere a surgeon is to be found.""Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in amoment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resignedthe poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's care, and wasoff for the town with the utmost rapidity.As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said whichof the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: CaptainWentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother,hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes fromone sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witnessthe hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which hecould not give.Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, whichinstinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggestcomfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, toassuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to herfor directions.""Anne, Anne,"" cried Charles, ""What is to be done next?  What, inheaven's name, is to be done next?""Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.""Had not she better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure: carry hergently to the inn.""""Yes, yes, to the inn,"" repeated Captain Wentworth, comparativelycollected, and eager to be doing something.  ""I will carry her myself.Musgrove, take care of the others.""By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmenand boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to beuseful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady,nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the firstreport.  To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta wasconsigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; andin this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to hiswife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, theground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, theyhad passed along.They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.  CaptainBenwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance whichshowed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.  Shocked asCaptain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could beinstantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what wasto be done.  She must be taken to their house; all must go to theirhouse; and await the surgeon's arrival there.  They would not listen toscruples:  he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and whileLouisa, under Mrs Harville's direction, was conveyed up stairs, andgiven possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restorativeswere supplied by her husband to all who needed them.Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, withoutapparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life, however, ofservice to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable ofbeing in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hopeand fear, from a return of her own insensibility.  Mary, too, wasgrowing calmer.The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.  Theywere sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.  Thehead had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuriesrecovered from:  he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say afew hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; andthe ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after afew fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, maybe conceived.The tone, the look, with which ""Thank God!"" was uttered by CaptainWentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sightof him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with foldedarms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings ofhis soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.Louisa's limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to bedone, as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak toeach other and consult.  That Louisa must remain where she was, howeverdistressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in suchtrouble, did not admit a doubt.  Her removal was impossible.  TheHarvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, allgratitude.  They had looked forward and arranged everything before theothers began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up his room tothem, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.  Theywere only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yetperhaps, by ""putting the children away in the maid's room, or swinginga cot somewhere,"" they could hardly bear to think of not finding roomfor two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though,with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be theleast uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.  MrsHarville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who hadlived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just suchanother.  Between these two, she could want no possible attendance byday or night.  And all this was said with a truth and sincerity offeeling irresistible.Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three inconsultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange ofperplexity and terror.  ""Uppercross, the necessity of some one's goingto Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mrand Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gonesince they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being intolerable time."" At first, they were capable of nothing more to thepurpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,exerting himself, said--""We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.  Everyminute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercrossinstantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go.""Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.  Hewould be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, norwould.  So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared thesame.  She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  Theusefulness of her staying!  She who had not been able to remain inLouisa's room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made herworse than helpless!  She was forced to acknowledge that she could dono good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by thethought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented, shewas anxious to be at home.The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down fromLouisa's room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour doorwas open.""Then it is settled, Musgrove,"" cried Captain Wentworth, ""that youstay, and that I take care of your sister home.  But as to the rest, asto the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need beonly one.  Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back toher children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable asAnne.""She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself sospoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she thenappeared.""You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;"" cried he,turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, whichseemed almost restoring the past.  She coloured deeply, and herecollected himself and moved away.  She expressed herself mostwilling, ready, happy to remain.  ""It was what she had been thinkingof, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor in Louisa'sroom would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so.""One thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was ratherdesirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by someshare of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to takethem back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and CaptainWentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be muchbetter for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove'scarriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when therewould be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa's night.Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,and to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was madeknown to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.  She wasso wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in beingexpected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa,while she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta'sstead!  Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?  And to go homewithout Charles, too, without her husband!  No, it was too unkind.  Andin short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and asnone of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help forit; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable.Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous andill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for thetown, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attendingto her.  She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along, tothe little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier inthe morning.  There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes for DrShirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot;a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, orthose who were wrapt up in her welfare.Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united asthey all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasingdegree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking thatit might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four inwaiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of thestreet; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution ofone sister for the other, the change in his countenance, theastonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charleswas listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must atleast convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful toLouisa.She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating thefeelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended onLouisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; andshe hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrinkunnecessarily from the office of a friend.In the meanwhile she was in the carriage.  He had handed them both in,and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under thesecircumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quittedLyme.  How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect theirmanners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could notforesee.  It was all quite natural, however.  He was devoted toHenrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, alwayswith the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.  Ingeneral, his voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henriettafrom agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only, when she hadbeen grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb,bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, asif wholly overcome--""Don't talk of it, don't talk of it,"" he cried.  ""Oh God! that I hadnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!  Butso eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!""Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question thejustness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity andadvantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike himthat, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have itsproportions and limits.  She thought it could scarcely escape him tofeel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour ofhappiness as a very resolute character.They got on fast.  Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills andthe same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by some dreadof the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the daybefore.  It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in theneighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence amongthem for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawlover her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep;when, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all atonce addressed by Captain Wentworth.  In a low, cautious voice, hesaid:--""I have been considering what we had best do.  She must not appear atfirst.  She could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether you hadnot better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break itto Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?""She did:  he was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance ofthe appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship, and ofdeference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became asort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he hadseen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and thedaughter all the better for being with them, he announced his intentionof returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses werebaited, he was off.(End of volume one.)"
Persuasion,13,"Chapter 13The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only twodays, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had thesatisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as animmediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for thefuture, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits,would have been difficulties.They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Louisa was muchthe same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.  Charles came afew hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account.  Hewas tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure must not be hoped, buteverything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.  Inspeaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense oftheir kindness, especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.""She really left nothing for Mary to do.  He and Mary had beenpersuaded to go early to their inn last night.  Mary had beenhysterical again this morning.  When he came away, she was going towalk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good.  Healmost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before;but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.""Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had atfirst half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.  Itwould be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase hisown distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon.  Achaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a farmore useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one whohaving brought up all the children, and seen the very last, thelingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after hisbrothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings anddress all the blains and bruises she could get near her, and who,consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nursedear Miss Louisa.  Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurredbefore to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardlyhave been resolved on, and found practicable so soon.They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minuteknowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain everytwenty-four hours.  He made it his business to go to Lyme, and hisaccount was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense andconsciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed inCaptain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.""What should they do without her?  They were wretched comforters forone another.""  And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought shecould not do better than impart among them the general inclination towhich she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.  Shehad little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; goto-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as itsuited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.  They must betaking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they mightat least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children; and inshort, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted withwhat she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morningat Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sendingthem off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary rangeof the house was the consequence.She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was thevery last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animatedboth houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.A few days had made a change indeed!If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.  More than formerhappiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt, to her mindthere was none, of what would follow her recovery.  A few months hence,and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self,might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that wasglowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike AnneElliot!An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a darkNovember day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very fewobjects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make thesound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, thoughdesirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look anadieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda,or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements ofthe village, without a saddened heart.  Scenes had passed in Uppercrosswhich made it precious.  It stood the record of many sensations ofpain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relentingfeeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which couldnever be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.  Sheleft it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things hadbeen.Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell's housein September.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of itsbeing possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade andescape from.  Her first return was to resume her place in the modernand elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of itsmistress.There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily, either Annewas improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so;and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had theamusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin,and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youthand beauty.When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mentalchange.  The subjects of which her heart had been full on leavingKellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled tosmother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when LadyRussell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke hersatisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, andher regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them, Anne would havebeen ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lymeand Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there; how much moreinteresting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles andCaptain Benwick, than her own father's house in Camden Place, or herown sister's intimacy with Mrs Clay.  She was actually forced to exertherself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equalsolicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on anothersubject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.  Lady Russell hadnot been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account ofthe whole had burst on her; but still it must be talked of, she mustmake enquiries, she must regret the imprudence, lament the result, andCaptain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.  Anne was consciousof not doing it so well as Lady Russell.  She could not speak the name,and look straight forward to Lady Russell's eye, till she had adoptedthe expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachmentbetween him and Louisa.  When this was told, his name distressed her nolonger.Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, butinternally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat ofthe value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmedby a Louisa Musgrove.The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstanceto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, whichfound their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a ratherimproving account of Louisa.  At the end of that period, Lady Russell'spoliteness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings ofthe past became in a decided tone, ""I must call on Mrs Croft; I reallymust call upon her soon.  Anne, have you courage to go with me, and paya visit in that house?  It will be some trial to us both.""Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as shesaid, in observing--""I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; yourfeelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.  By remaining inthe neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.""She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high anopinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate inhis tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and thepoor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamedfor the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feelthat they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hallhad passed into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions mustunquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but theyprecluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering thehouse again, and returning through the well-known apartments.In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, ""These roomsought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen in their destination!  Howunworthily occupied!  An ancient family to be so driven away!Strangers filling their place!"" No, except when she thought of hermother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside, shehad no sigh of that description to heave.Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure offancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receivingher in that house, there was particular attention.The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and oncomparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that eachlady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; thatCaptain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time sincethe accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not beenable to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and thenreturned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quittingit any more.  He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; hadexpressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being the worse for herexertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.  This washandsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else couldhave done.As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in onestyle by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had towork on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it hadbeen the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; thatits effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, howlong Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable shewould still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!  TheAdmiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--""Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this, for a youngfellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head, is not it,Miss Elliot?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!""Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit LadyRussell, but they delighted Anne.  His goodness of heart and simplicityof character were irresistible.""Now, this must be very bad for you,"" said he, suddenly rousing from alittle reverie, ""to be coming and finding us here.  I had notrecollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.  But now, donot stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms in the houseif you like it.""""Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.""""Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery atany time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up bythat door.  A good place is not it?  But,"" (checking himself), ""youwill not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in thebutler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.  One man's ways may beas good as another's, but we all like our own best.  And so you mustjudge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about thehouse or not.""Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.""We have made very few changes either,"" continued the Admiral, afterthinking a moment.  ""Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door, atUppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.  The wonder was,how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of itsopening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sir Walter what we havedone, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the houseever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the fewalterations we have made have been all very much for the better.  Mywife should have the credit of them, however.  I have done very littlebesides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from mydressing-room, which was your father's.  A very good man, and very muchthe gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot,"" (lookingwith serious reflection), ""I should think he must be rather a dressyman for his time of life.  Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord!there was no getting away from one's self.  So I got Sophy to lend me ahand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, withmy little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that Inever go near.""Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took upthe subject again, to say--""The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray givehim my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled herequite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is onlywhen the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen threetimes a winter.  And take it altogether, now that we have been intomost of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that welike better than this.  Pray say so, with my compliments.  He will beglad to hear it.""Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: butthe acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far atpresent; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves tobe going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the northof the county, and probably might not be at home again before LadyRussell would be removing to Bath.So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at KellynchHall, or of seeing him in company with her friend.  Everything was safeenough, and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted onthe subject."
Persuasion,14,"Chapter 14Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr andMrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been at allwanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; andas soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over tothe Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head,though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to thehighest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to bealtogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when shemight be able to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, whomust return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmasholidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.They had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had got MrsHarville's children away as much as she could, every possible supplyfrom Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to theHarvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinnerevery day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on eachside as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable.Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by herstaying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.  CharlesHayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when they dinedwith the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and atfirst Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then,she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding outwhose daughter she was, and there had been so much going on every day,there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,and she had got books from the library, and changed them so often, thatthe balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme.  She had beentaken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had gone to church,and there were a great many more people to look at in the church atLyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being sovery useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight.Anne enquired after Captain Benwick. Mary's face was clouded directly.Charles laughed.""Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very oddyoung man.  I do not know what he would be at.  We asked him to comehome with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook to give him someshooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought itwas all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he made a very awkwardsort of excuse; 'he never shot' and he had 'been quite misunderstood,'and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of itwas, I found, that he did not mean to come.  I suppose he was afraid offinding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were livelyenough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.""Charles laughed again and said, ""Now Mary, you know very well how itreally was.  It was all your doing,"" (turning to Anne.) ""He fanciedthat if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fanciedeverybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that LadyRussell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had notcourage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour. Mary knows it is.""But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from notconsidering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be inlove with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greaterattraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard.She boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries.""Oh! he talks of you,"" cried Charles, ""in such terms--"" Maryinterrupted him. ""I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Annetwice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne, he never talks of youat all.""""No,"" admitted Charles, ""I do not know that he ever does, in a generalway; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires youexceedingly.  His head is full of some books that he is reading uponyour recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he hasfound out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh! Icannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--Ioverheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot'was spoken of in the highest terms!  Now Mary, I declare it was so, Iheard it myself, and you were in the other room.  'Elegance, sweetness,beauty.' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms.""""And I am sure,"" cried Mary, warmly, ""it was a very little to hiscredit, if he did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart isvery little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure you willagree with me.""""I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,"" said Lady Russell,smiling.""And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,""said Charles.  ""Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, andsetting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will makehis way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it.  Itold him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church'sbeing so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sortof things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened withall his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that youwill have him calling here soon.  So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.""""Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,"" was LadyRussell's kind answer.""Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance,"" said Mary, ""I think he is rathermy acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this lastfortnight.""""Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to seeCaptain Benwick.""""You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He has walked withme, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying aword.  He is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will notlike him.""""There we differ, Mary,"" said Anne.  ""I think Lady Russell would likehim.  I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that shewould very soon see no deficiency in his manner.""""So do I, Anne,"" said Charles.  ""I am sure Lady Russell would like him.He is just Lady Russell's sort.  Give him a book, and he will read allday long.""""Yes, that he will!"" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  ""He will sit poringover his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when onedrops one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think LadyRussell would like that?""Lady Russell could not help laughing.  ""Upon my word,"" said she, ""Ishould not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admittedof such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I maycall myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person who can giveoccasion to such directly opposite notions.  I wish he may be inducedto call here.  And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing myopinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand.""""You will not like him, I will answer for it.""Lady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke withanimation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot soextraordinarily.""He is a man,"" said Lady Russell, ""whom I have no wish to see.  Hisdeclining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has lefta very strong impression in his disfavour with me.""This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short in themidst of the Elliot countenance.With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,there was voluntary communication sufficient.  His spirits had beengreatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved, hehad improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what hehad been the first week.  He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremelyfearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he didnot press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan ofgoing away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.  He hadtalked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuadeCaptain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last,Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionallythinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.  Lady Russell could nothear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; norcould Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in herfather's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, withoutwondering whether she might see him or hear of him.  Captain Benwickcame not, however.  He was either less disposed for it than Charles hadimagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week's indulgence,Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he hadbeen beginning to excite.The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls fromschool, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improvethe noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remainedwith Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usualquarters.Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Annecould not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor CaptainWentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as couldbe wished to the last state she had seen it in.Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whomshe was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children fromthe Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side was a tableoccupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; andon the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawnand cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the wholecompleted by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to beheard, in spite of all the noise of the others.  Charles and Mary alsocame in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point ofpaying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for tenminutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of thechildren on his knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such adomestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa'sillness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove, who got Annenear her on purpose to thank her most cordially, again and again, forall her attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of whatshe had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round theroom, that after all she had gone through, nothing was so likely to doher good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.Louisa was now recovering apace.  Her mother could even think of herbeing able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisterswent to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her andstay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.""I hope I shall remember, in future,"" said Lady Russell, as soon asthey were reseated in the carriage, ""not to call at Uppercross in theChristmas holidays.""Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; andsounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort ratherthan their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards, wasentering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long courseof streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash ofother carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling ofnewspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink ofpattens, she made no complaint.  No, these were noises which belongedto the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; andlike Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after beinglong in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quietcheerfulness.Anne did not share these feelings.  She persisted in a very determined,though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim viewof the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeingthem better; felt their progress through the streets to be, howeverdisagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when shearrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles ofUppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of someinterest.  Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He had called in Camden Place; hadcalled a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  IfElizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been takingmuch pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of theconnection, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This wasvery wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of veryagreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recantingthe sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being ""a manwhom she had no wish to see.""  She had a great wish to see him.  If hereally sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must beforgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but shefelt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was morethan she could say for many other persons in Bath.She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to herown lodgings, in Rivers Street."
Persuasion,15,"Chapter 15Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a loftydignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both heand Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment ofmany months, and anxiously saying to herself, ""Oh! when shall I leaveyou again?""  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcomeshe received, did her good.  Her father and sister were glad to seeher, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture, and met herwith kindness.  Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, wasnoticed as an advantage.Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies andsmiles were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that shewould pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance ofthe others was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,and she was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination tolisten to her.  After laying out for some compliments of being deeplyregretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, theyhad only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be alltheir own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: itwas all Bath.They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answeredtheir expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly thebest in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantagesover all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and thesuperiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the tasteof the furniture.  Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.Everybody was wanting to visit them.  They had drawn back from manyintroductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by peopleof whom they knew nothing.Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her father andsister were happy?  She might not wonder, but she must sigh that herfather should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing toregret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, shouldfind so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she mustsigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open thefolding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to theother, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, whohad been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud ofbetween two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.But this was not all which they had to make them happy.  They had MrElliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.  He was notonly pardoned, they were delighted with him.  He had been in Bath abouta fortnight; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his way toLondon, when the intelligence of Sir Walter's being settled there hadof course reached him, though only twenty-four hours in the place, buthe had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been afortnight in Bath, and his first object on arriving, had been to leavehis card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavoursto meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to bereceived as a relation again, that their former good understanding wascompletely re-established.They had not a fault to find in him.  He had explained away all theappearance of neglect on his own side.  It had originated inmisapprehension entirely.  He had never had an idea of throwing himselfoff; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, anddelicacy had kept him silent.  Upon the hint of having spokendisrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, hewas quite indignant.  He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, andwhose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit theunfeudal tone of the present day.  He was astonished, indeed, but hischaracter and general conduct must refute it.  He could refer SirWalter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been takingon this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to thefooting of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of hisopinions on the subject.The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of muchextenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself; buta very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectableman, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walteradded), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, andhad, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintancethrough Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to themarriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted alsowith his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.  She wascertainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich,and excessively in love with his friend.  There had been the charm.She had sought him.  Without that attraction, not all her money wouldhave tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of herhaving been a very fine woman.  Here was a great deal to soften thebusiness.  A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabethcould not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, sheallowed it be a great extenuation.Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidentlydelighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinnersin general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, andplacing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances, largeallowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.She heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant orirrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no originbut in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she had thesensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, inMr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be wellreceived by them.  In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by beingon terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.  Inall probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynchestate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.  A sensible man,and he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an objectto him?  She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, forElizabeth's sake.  There might really have been a liking formerly,though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and nowthat he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay hisaddresses to her.  Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, withwell-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have beenpenetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very younghimself.  How her temper and understanding might bear the investigationof his present keener time of life was another concern and rather afearful one.  Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be toonice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabethwas disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay wasencouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,while Mr Elliot's frequent visits were talked of.Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but withoutbeing much attended to.  ""Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.They did not know.  It might be him, perhaps.""  They could not listento her description of him.  They were describing him themselves; SirWalter especially.  He did justice to his very gentlemanlikeappearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, hissensible eye; but, at the same time, ""must lament his being very muchunder-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could hepretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature forthe worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) waslooking exactly as he had done when they last parted;"" but Sir Walterhad ""not been able to return the compliment entirely, which hadembarrassed him.  He did not mean to complain, however.  Mr Elliot wasbetter to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seenwith him anywhere.""Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of thewhole evening.  ""Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introducedto them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!"" and there was a MrsWallis, at present known only to them by description, as she was indaily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as ""amost charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place,"" andas soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.  Sir Walterthought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively prettywoman, beautiful.  ""He longed to see her.  He hoped she might make someamends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in thestreets.  The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.  He didnot mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of theplain was out of all proportion.  He had frequently observed, as hewalked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, orfive-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on BondStreet, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,without there being a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frostymorning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in athousand could stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were adreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!  theywere infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anythingtolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.  Hehad never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was afine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that everywoman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was sure to be upon ColonelWallis.""  Modest Sir Walter!  He was not allowed to escape, however.His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis'scompanion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainlywas not sandy-haired.""How is Mary looking?"" said Sir Walter, in the height of his goodhumour.  ""The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope thatmay not happen every day.""""Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she has beenin very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.""""If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and growcoarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.""Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at thedoor suspended everything.  ""A knock at the door! and so late!  It wasten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he was to dine inLansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he might stop in his way hometo ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.  Mrs Claydecidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock.""  Mrs Clay was right.  With allthe state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliot was usheredinto the room.It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments, andher sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but ""hecould not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor herfriend had taken cold the day before,"" &c. &c; which was all aspolitely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part mustfollow then.  Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter; ""Mr Elliotmust give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter"" (there wasno occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, verybecomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by nomeans forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his little startof surprise, that he had not been at all aware of who she was.  Helooked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; hiseyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed therelationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as anacquaintance already.  He was quite as good-looking as he had appearedat Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking, and his manners were soexactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularlyagreeable, that she could compare them in excellence to only oneperson's manners.  They were not the same, but they were, perhaps,equally good.He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.  Ten minutes wereenough to certify that.  His tone, his expressions, his choice ofsubject, his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of asensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he could, he began to talk toher of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, butespecially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening tobe guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route,understand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost suchan opportunity of paying his respects to her.  She gave him a shortaccount of her party and business at Lyme.  His regret increased as helistened.  He had spent his whole solitary evening in the roomadjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought theymust be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, butcertainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadowof a right to introduce himself.  If he had but asked who the partywere!  The name of Musgrove would have told him enough.  ""Well, itwould serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking aquestion at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, onthe principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.""The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,"" said he, ""as towhat is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing, are moreabsurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by thefolly of what they have in view.""But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone: he knewit; he was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only atintervals that he could return to Lyme.His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene shehad been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.  Havingalluded to ""an accident,""  he must hear the whole.  When he questioned,Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference intheir manner of doing it could not be unfelt.  She could only compareMr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what hadpassed, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered inwitnessing it.He staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-piecehad struck ""eleven with its silver sounds,"" and the watchman wasbeginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before MrElliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening inCamden Place could have passed so well!"
Persuasion,16,"Chapter 16There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would havebeen more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's being in lovewith Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being in love with MrsClay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been athome a few hours.  On going down to breakfast the next morning, shefound there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side ofmeaning to leave them.  She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that""now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself at all wanted;""for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, ""That must not be anyreason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.  She is nothing to me,compared with you;""  and she was in full time to hear her father say,""My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet, you have seen nothing ofBath.  You have been here only to be useful.  You must not run awayfrom us now.  You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, thebeautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind, I well know the sight ofbeauty is a real gratification.""He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised tosee Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.  Hercountenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praiseof the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister.  Thelady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to bealone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; hethought her ""less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, hercomplexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she been using anything in particular?""  ""No, nothing.""  ""Merely Gowland,"" he supposed.""No, nothing at all.""  ""Ha! he was surprised at that;"" and added,""certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannotbe better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use ofGowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been using it at myrecommendation, and you see what it has done for her.  You see how ithas carried away her freckles.""If Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise mighthave struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne that thefreckles were at all lessened.  But everything must take its chance.The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were alsoto marry.  As for herself, she might always command a home with LadyRussell.Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trialon this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of MrsClay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetualprovocation to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as aperson in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, andhas a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable, or moreindifferent, towards the others.  His manners were an immediaterecommendation; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fullysupporting the superficial, that she was at first, as she told Anne,almost ready to exclaim, ""Can this be Mr Elliot?"" and could notseriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.Everything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions,knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.  He had strong feelings offamily attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; helived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; hejudged for himself in everything essential, without defying publicopinion in any point of worldly decorum.  He was steady, observant,moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness,which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility towhat was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities ofdomestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violentagitation seldom really possess.  She was sure that he had not beenhappy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind, nor (she began prettysoon to suspect) to prevent his thinking of a second choice.  Hersatisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and herexcellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did notsurprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothingsuspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives thanappeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.  In LadyRussell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a maturetime of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what wouldvery generally recommend him among all sensible people, to be on goodterms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world oftime upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday ofyouth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last tomention ""Elizabeth.""  Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made onlythis cautious reply:--""Elizabeth! very well; time will explain.""It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a littleobservation, felt she must submit to.  She could determine nothing atpresent.  In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in thehabit of such general observance as ""Miss Elliot,"" that anyparticularity of attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.  A littledelay on his side might be very excusable.  In fact, Anne could neversee the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was theinexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for thoughhis marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so manyyears that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from theawful impression of its being dissolved.However it might end, he was without any question their pleasantestacquaintance in Bath:  she saw nobody equal to him; and it was a greatindulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed tohave as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great manytimes.  He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with someearnestness.  She knew it well; and she remembered another person'slook also.They did not always think alike.  His value for rank and connexion sheperceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance, itmust be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly into herfather and sister's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthyto excite them.  The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival ofthe Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her daughter, the HonourableMiss Carteret; and all the comfort of No. --, Camden Place, was sweptaway for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anne's opinion, mostunfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how tointroduce themselves properly.Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact withnobility, and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She had hopedbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, andwas reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish thatthey had more pride; for ""our cousins Lady Dalrymple and MissCarteret;"" ""our cousins, the Dalrymples,"" sounded in her ears all daylong.Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but hadnever seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of thecase arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse byletters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's at the sametime, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.  No letter ofcondolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect had been visited onthe head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, noletter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, therewas but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered therelationship as closed.  How to have this anxious business set torights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question:  and it wasa question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell norMr Elliot thought unimportant.  ""Family connexions were always worthpreserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had takena house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living instyle.  She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell hadheard her spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable thatthe connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without anycompromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.""Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote avery fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to hisright honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot couldadmire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing threelines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.  ""She was very muchhonoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance."" The toils of thebusiness were over, the sweets began.  They visited in Laura Place,they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the HonourableMiss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible:  and""Our cousins in Laura Place,""--""Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and MissCarteret,"" were talked of to everybody.Anne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been veryagreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation theycreated, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,accomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired the nameof ""a charming woman,"" because she had a smile and a civil answer foreverybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and soawkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place butfor her birth.Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet ""itwas an acquaintance worth having;"" and when Anne ventured to speak heropinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing inthemselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as goodcompany, as those who would collect good company around them, they hadtheir value.  Anne smiled and said,""My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that iswhat I call good company.""""You are mistaken,"" said he gently, ""that is not good company; that isthe best.  Good company requires only birth, education, and manners,and with regard to education is not very nice.  Birth and good mannersare essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thingin good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.  My cousin Anneshakes her head.  She is not satisfied.  She is fastidious.  My dearcousin"" (sitting down by her), ""you have a better right to befastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?Will it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society ofthose good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of theconnexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it, that they willmove in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, yourbeing known to be related to them will have its use in fixing yourfamily (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which wemust all wish for.""""Yes,"" sighed Anne, ""we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!""then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,""I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken toprocure the acquaintance.  I suppose"" (smiling) ""I have more pride thanany of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be sosolicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be verysure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.""""Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.  In London,perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say:but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worthknowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance.""""Well,"" said Anne, ""I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcomewhich depends so entirely upon place.""""I love your indignation,"" said he; ""it is very natural.  But here youare in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all thecredit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.  Youtalk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish tobelieve myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would havethe same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a littledifferent.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,"" (he continued,speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) ""in onepoint, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that every additionto your father's society, among his equals or superiors, may be of usein diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.""He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been latelyoccupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant; andthough Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscienceadmitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting greatacquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her."
Persuasion,17,"Chapter 17While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their goodfortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a verydifferent description.She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of therebeing an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims onher attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of herlife when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feelingher separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, ofstrong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from thewant of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year atschool, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerablylessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, wassaid to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne hadknown of her, till now that their governess's account brought hersituation forward in a more decided but very different form.She was a widow and poor.  Her husband had been extravagant; and at hisdeath, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfullyinvolved.  She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, andin addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severerheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her forthe present a cripple.  She had come to Bath on that account, and wasnow in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unableeven to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almostexcluded from society.Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit fromMiss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time ingoing.  She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what sheintended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.  She onlyconsulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, andwas most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings inWestgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interestin each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes had itsawkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone since they hadparted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what theother had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming,silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman ofseven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners asconsciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years hadtransformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glowof health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helplesswidow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but allthat was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and leftonly the interesting charm of remembering former partialities andtalking over old times.Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which shehad almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and becheerful beyond her expectation.  Neither the dissipations of thepast--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions ofthe present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed herheart or ruined her spirits.In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, andAnne's astonishment increased.  She could scarcely imagine a morecheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.  She had been very fondof her husband:  she had buried him.  She had been used to affluence:it was gone.  She had no child to connect her with life and happinessagain, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs,no health to make all the rest supportable.  Her accommodations werelimited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with nopossibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, whichthere was only one servant in the house to afford, and she neverquitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.  Yet, in spiteof all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only oflanguor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.  Howcould it be?  She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determinedthat this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.  Asubmissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supplyresolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity ofmind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readilyfrom evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out ofherself, which was from nature alone.  It was the choicest gift ofHeaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which,by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almostevery other want.There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearlyfailed.  She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with herstate on first reaching Bath.  Then she had, indeed, been a pitiableobject; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly takenpossession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed andsuffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances atthat moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.  Shehad weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done hergood.  It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to bein good hands.  She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden ordisinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to herthat her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use herill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sisterof her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home inthat house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time toattend her.  ""And she,"" said Mrs Smith, ""besides nursing me mostadmirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as Icould use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a greatamusement; and she put me in the way of making these littlethread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me sobusy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little goodto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.  She had alarge acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who canafford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.  She always takesthe right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open, you know, whenthey have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering theblessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when tospeak.  She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.  Hers is a linefor seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense andobservation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior tothousands of those who having only received 'the best education in theworld,' know nothing worth attending to.  Call it gossip, if you will,but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she issure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:something that makes one know one's species better.  One likes to hearwhat is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of beingtrifling and silly.  To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, Iassure you, is a treat.""Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, ""I can easilybelieve it.  Women of that class have great opportunities, and if theyare intelligent may be well worth listening to.  Such varieties ofhuman nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!  And it is notmerely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see itoccasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting oraffecting.  What instances must pass before them of ardent,disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrificesthat ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish the worth ofvolumes.""""Yes,"" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, ""sometimes it may, though I fearits lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.  Here andthere, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generallyspeaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in asick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosityand fortitude, that one hears of.  There is so little real friendshipin the world! and unfortunately"" (speaking low and tremulously) ""thereare so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.""Anne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been what heought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which madeher think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.  It was but apassing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soonadded in a different tone--""I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She is only nursingMrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to reportbut of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,however.  She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all thehigh-priced things I have in hand now.""Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence ofsuch a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessaryto speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned onemorning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymplefor the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend thatevening in Westgate Buildings.  She was not sorry for the excuse.  Theywere only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept athome by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which hadbeen so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with greatalacrity--""She was engaged to spend the evening with an oldschoolfellow.""  They were not much interested in anything relative toAnne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make itunderstood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth wasdisdainful, and Sir Walter severe.""Westgate Buildings!"" said he, ""and who is Miss Anne Elliot to bevisiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith; andwho was her husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are tobe met with everywhere.  And what is her attraction?  That she is oldand sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the mostextraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts other people, lowcompany, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are invitingto you.  But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow:  sheis not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see anotherday.  What is her age?  Forty?""""No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put offmy engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which willat once suit her and myself.  She goes into the warm bath to-morrow,and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.""""But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?"" askedElizabeth.""She sees nothing to blame in it,"" replied Anne; ""on the contrary, sheapproves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on MrsSmith.""""Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearanceof a carriage drawn up near its pavement,"" observed Sir Walter.  ""SirHenry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms,but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known toconvey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere MrsSmith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in theworld, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferredby her to her own family connections among the nobility of England andIreland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!""Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought itadvisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and didlong to say a little in defence of her friend's not very dissimilarclaims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her fatherprevented her.  She made no reply.  She left it to himself torecollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirtyand forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course sheheard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.  She hadbeen the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth hadnot only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves, but hadactually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and hadbeen at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and MrElliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and LadyRussell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to waiton her.  Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening couldsupply from Lady Russell.  To her, its greatest interest must be, inhaving been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; inhaving been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured forstaying away in such a cause.  Her kind, compassionate visits to thisold schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted MrElliot.  He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in hertemper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.  He could meeteven Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not begiven to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to beso highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeablesensations which her friend meant to create.Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of hisdeserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks whichwould free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, andleave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.  Shewould not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on thesubject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might behereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirablenessof the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled,blushed, and gently shook her head.""I am no match-maker, as you well know,"" said Lady Russell, ""being muchtoo well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addressesto you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think therewould be every possibility of your being happy together.  A mostsuitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might bea very happy one.""""Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects Ithink highly of him,"" said Anne; ""but we should not suit.""Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, ""I own that tobe able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the futureLady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother'splace, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well asto all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.You are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if Imight be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name,and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior toher in being more highly valued!  My dearest Anne, it would give memore delight than is often felt at my time of life!""Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelingsthis picture excited.  For a few moments her imagination and her heartwere bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her mother had been; ofhaving the precious name of ""Lady Elliot"" first revived in herself; ofbeing restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again, her home forever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.  Lady Russellsaid not another word, willing to leave the matter to its ownoperation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment withpropriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short, what Annedid not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himselfbrought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch and of ""LadyElliot"" all faded away.  She never could accept him.  And it was notonly that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one; herjudgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such acase was against Mr Elliot.Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfiedthat she really knew his character.  That he was a sensible man, anagreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed tojudge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough.He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one articleof moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have beenafraid to answer for his conduct.  She distrusted the past, if not thepresent.  The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, theallusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions notfavourable of what he had been.  She saw that there had been badhabits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there hadbeen a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he hadbeen, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he mightnow think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments ofa clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a faircharacter?  How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was trulycleansed?Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.  Therewas never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,at the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decidedimperfection.  Her early impressions were incurable.  She prized thefrank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.  Warmthand enthusiasm did captivate her still.  She felt that she could somuch more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked orsaid a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mindnever varied, whose tongue never slipped.Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers inher father's house, he pleased them all.  He endured too well, stoodtoo well with every body.  He had spoken to her with some degree ofopenness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay wasabout, and to hold her in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him asagreeable as any body.Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend, for she sawnothing to excite distrust.  She could not imagine a man more exactlywhat he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeterfeeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her belovedAnne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn."
Persuasion,18,"Chapter 18It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month inBath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.  Shewanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.  It was threeweeks since she had heard at all.  She only knew that Henrietta was athome again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering fast,was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all very intently oneevening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered toher; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and MrsCroft's compliments.The Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest her.  They werepeople whom her heart turned to very naturally.""What is this?"" cried Sir Walter.  ""The Crofts have arrived in Bath?The Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?""""A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.""""Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure anintroduction.  I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at anyrate.  I know what is due to my tenant.""Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poorAdmiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.  It had beenbegun several days back.""February 1st.""My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know howlittle people think of letters in such a place as Bath.  You must be agreat deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know,affords little to write about.  We have had a very dull Christmas; Mrand Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.  I donot reckon the Hayters as anybody.  The holidays, however, are over atlast:  I believe no children ever had such long ones.  I am sure I hadnot.  The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles;but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.  MrsHarville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.  I do notunderstand it.  They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; butMrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than hergrandchildren.  What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be feltin Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of someconsequence.  I have not had a creature call on me since the secondweek in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling muchoftener than was welcome.  Between ourselves, I think it a great pityHenrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kepther a little out of his way.  The carriage is gone to-day, to bringLouisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.  We are not asked to dine withthem, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of herbeing fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, consideringthe care that will be taken of her; and it would be much moreconvenient to me to dine there to-morrow.  I am glad you find Mr Elliotso agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I havemy usual luck:  I am always out of the way when any thing desirable isgoing on; always the last of my family to be noticed.  What an immensetime Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!  Does she never mean togo away?  But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we mightnot be invited.  Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expectmy children to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great Housevery well, for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that theCrofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiralgouty.  Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had thecivility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.  I donot think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,and this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charles joins mein love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,""Mary M---.""I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has justtold me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very muchabout.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, arealways worse than anybody's.""So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into anenvelope, containing nearly as much more.""I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore herjourney, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add.In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering toconvey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed tome, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter aslong as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerelyhope Bath will do him all the good he wants.  I shall be truly glad tohave them back again.  Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasantfamily.  But now for Louisa.  I have something to communicate that willastonish you not a little.  She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday verysafely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we wererather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he hadbeen invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was thereason?  Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, andnot choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from MrMusgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she cameaway, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.  True, uponmy honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised at least ifyou ever received a hint of it, for I never did.  Mrs Musgrove protestssolemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.  We are all very wellpleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying CaptainWentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrovehas written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.  MrsHarville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister'saccount; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both.  Indeed,Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for havingnursed her.  Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but ifyou remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could seeanything of it.  And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick'sbeing supposed to be an admirer of yours.  How Charles could take sucha thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me.  I hope hewill be more agreeable now.  Certainly not a great match for LouisaMusgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.""Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared forthe news.  She had never in her life been more astonished.  CaptainBenwick and Louisa Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful for belief,and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room,preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of themoment.  Happily for her, they were not many.  Sir Walter wanted toknow whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether theywere likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit MissElliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond.""How is Mary?"" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, ""Andpray what brings the Crofts to Bath?""""They come on the Admiral's account.  He is thought to be gouty.""""Gout and decrepitude!"" said Sir Walter.  ""Poor old gentleman.""""Have they any acquaintance here?"" asked Elizabeth.""I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's timeof life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance insuch a place as this.""""I suspect,"" said Sir Walter coolly, ""that Admiral Croft will be bestknown in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.  Elizabeth, may weventure to present him and his wife in Laura Place?""""Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins,we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance shemight not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify; butas cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.  Wehad better leave the Crofts to find their own level.  There are severalodd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors.  TheCrofts will associate with them.""This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in anenquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne wasat liberty.In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charles wonderhow Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps he had quitted the field,had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akinto ill usage between him and his friend.  She could not endure thatsuch a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!  The high-spirited, joyous-talkingLouisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, CaptainBenwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.Their minds most dissimilar!  Where could have been the attraction?The answer soon presented itself.  It had been in situation.  They hadbeen thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the samesmall family party:  since Henrietta's coming away, they must have beendepending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recoveringfrom illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick wasnot inconsolable.  That was a point which Anne had not been able toavoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion asMary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirmthe idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.She did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify hervanity, than Mary might have allowed.  She was persuaded that anytolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel forhim would have received the same compliment.  He had an affectionateheart.  He must love somebody.She saw no reason against their being happy.  Louisa had fine navalfervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.  He wouldgain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scottand Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course theyhad fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of Louisa Musgrove turnedinto a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection wasamusing, but she had no doubt of its being so.  The day at Lyme, thefall from the Cobb, might influence her health, her nerves, hercourage, her character to the end of her life, as thoroughly as itappeared to have influenced her fate.The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had beensensible of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to preferanother man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lastingwonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainlynothing to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anne's heartbeat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks whenshe thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.  She had somefeelings which she was ashamed to investigate.  They were too much likejoy, senseless joy!She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it wasevident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.  The visit ofceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, andCaptain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectlyto Sir Walter's satisfaction.  He was not at all ashamed of theacquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more aboutthe Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, andconsidered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form,and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.  They broughtwith them their country habit of being almost always together.  He wasordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shareswith him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good.  Annesaw them wherever she went.  Lady Russell took her out in her carriagealmost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and neverfailed to see them.  Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a mostattractive picture of happiness to her.  She always watched them aslong as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might betalking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equallydelighted to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when heencountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversationwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croftlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walkingherself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten daysafter the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, orher friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return aloneto Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the goodfortune to meet with the Admiral.  He was standing by himself at aprintshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplationof some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but wasobliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch hisnotice.  When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was donewith all his usual frankness and good humour.  ""Ha! is it you?  Thankyou, thank you.  This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, yousee, staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop withoutstopping.  But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.Did you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters mustbe, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapelessold cockleshell as that?  And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in itmightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks andmountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which theycertainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!"" (laughingheartily); ""I would not venture over a horsepond in it.  Well,""(turning away), ""now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere for you,or with you?  Can I be of any use?""""None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of yourcompany the little way our road lies together.  I am going home.""""That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes we willhave a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we goalong.  There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable ifI have not a woman there.  Lord! what a boat it is!"" taking a last lookat the picture, as they began to be in motion.""Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?""""Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; Ishall only say, 'How d'ye do?' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.'How d'ye do?'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  She has a blister on one of herheels, as large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across thestreet, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.  Shabbyfellows, both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.Sophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once: got awaywith some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story anothertime.  There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.  Look, hesees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.  Ah! thepeace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sir Archibald!  Howdo you like Bath, Miss Elliot?  It suits us very well.  We are alwaysmeeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them everymorning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from themall, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, andare as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even atNorth Yarmouth and Deal.  We do not like our lodgings here the worse, Ican tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at NorthYarmouth.  The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the sameway.""When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again forwhat he had to communicate.  She hoped when clear of Milsom Street tohave her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, forthe Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained thegreater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really MrsCroft, she must let him have his own way.  As soon as they were fairlyascending Belmont, he began--""Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.  But firstof all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talkabout.  That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concernedfor.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.  HerChristian name:  I always forget her Christian name.""Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she reallydid; but now she could safely suggest the name of ""Louisa.""""Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladieshad not such a number of fine Christian names.  I should never be outif they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well, this MissLouisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.  He wascourting her week after week.  The only wonder was, what they could bewaiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clearenough that they must wait till her brain was set to right.  But eventhen there was something odd in their way of going on.  Instead ofstaying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to seeEdward.  When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward's,and there he has been ever since.  We have seen nothing of him sinceNovember.  Even Sophy could not understand it.  But now, the matter hastaken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same MissMusgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry JamesBenwick.  You know James Benwick.""""A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.""""Well, she is to marry him.  Nay, most likely they are married already,for I do not know what they should wait for.""""I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,"" said Anne, ""andI understand that he bears an excellent character.""""Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are badtimes for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.  Anexcellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealousofficer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for thatsoft sort of manner does not do him justice.""""Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want ofspirit from Captain Benwick's manners.  I thought them particularlypleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.""""Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rathertoo piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his.There is something about Frederick more to our taste.""Anne was caught.  She had only meant to oppose the too common idea ofspirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all torepresent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best that couldpossibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say,""I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends,"" but theAdmiral interrupted her with--""And the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.  Wehave it from Frederick himself.  His sister had a letter from himyesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in aletter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.  I fancythey are all at Uppercross.""This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said,therefore, ""I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style ofCaptain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularlyuneasy.  It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachmentbetween him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood tohave worn out on each side equally, and without violence.  I hope hisletter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.""""Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur frombeginning to end.""Anne looked down to hide her smile.""No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too muchspirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better, it is very fitshe should have him.""""Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing inCaptain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinkshimself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, withoutits being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry that such afriendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should bedestroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.""""Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of thatnature in the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own forwondering at it.'  No, you would not guess, from his way of writing,that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself.He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there isnothing very unforgiving in that, I think.""Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant toconvey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quietattention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.""Poor Frederick!"" said he at last.  ""Now he must begin all over againwith somebody else.  I think we must get him to Bath.  Sophy mustwrite, and beg him to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I amsure.  It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that otherMiss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.  Donot you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?"""
Persuasion,19,"Chapter 19While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing hiswish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth wasalready on his way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written, he wasarrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were inMilsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelterdesirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable forMiss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in LadyDalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she,Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore, turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliotstepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her assistance.  He soon joinedthem again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happyto take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes.Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than fourwith any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently itwas not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three CamdenPlace ladies.  There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot.  Whoeversuffered inconvenience, she must suffer none, but it occupied a littletime to settle the point of civility between the other two.  The rainwas a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk withMr Elliot.  But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she wouldhardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick! muchthicker than Miss Anne's; and, in short, her civility rendered herquite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be,and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and sodetermined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; MissElliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and MrElliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne's boots were rather thethickest.It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party in thecarriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she satnear the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, CaptainWentworth walking down the street.Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt thatshe was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable andabsurd!  For a few minutes she saw nothing before her; it was allconfusion.  She was lost, and when she had scolded back her senses, shefound the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (alwaysobliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of MrsClay's.She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she wanted tosee if it rained.  Why was she to suspect herself of another motive?Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.  She left her seat, she wouldgo; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the otherhalf, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was.  Shewould see if it rained.  She was sent back, however, in a moment by theentrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen andladies, evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined alittle below Milsom Street.  He was more obviously struck and confusedby the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quitered.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she feltthat she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.  She had theadvantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.  All theoverpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprisewere over with her.  Still, however, she had enough to feel!  It wasagitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery.He spoke to her, and then turned away.  The character of his manner wasembarrassment.  She could not have called it either cold or friendly,or anything so certainly as embarrassed.After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensibleof his being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being sovery much together, got to speak to each other with a considerableportion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do itnow.  Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.  There wasconsciousness of some sort or other.  He looked very well, not as if hehad been suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look ofhis own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was CaptainWentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabethwould not know him.  She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth sawhim, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she wasconvinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away withunalterable coldness.Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing veryimpatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.  It wasbeginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and abustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shopunderstand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot.  Atlast Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but by the servant, (forthere was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth,watching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words,was offering his services to her.""I am much obliged to you,"" was her answer, ""but I am not going withthem.  The carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I preferwalking.""""But it rains.""""Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard.""After a moment's pause he said:  ""Though I came only yesterday, I haveequipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,"" (pointing to a newumbrella); ""I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined towalk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you achair.""She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating herconviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding,""I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He will be here in a moment, I amsure.""She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.  CaptainWentworth recollected him perfectly.  There was no difference betweenhim and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne asshe passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privilegedrelation and friend.  He came in with eagerness, appeared to see andthink only of her, apologised for his stay, was grieved to have kepther waiting, and anxious to get her away without further loss of timeand before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked offtogether, her arm under his, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a""Good morning to you!"" being all that she had time for, as she passedaway.As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth'sparty began talking of them.""Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?""""Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.  What avery good-looking man!""""Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises, sayshe is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.""""She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes tolook at her.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admireher more than her sister.""""Oh! so do I.""""And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after MissElliot.  Anne is too delicate for them.""Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he wouldhave walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying aword.  She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, thoughnothing could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjectswere principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise,warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuationshighly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now she could think only ofCaptain Wentworth.  She could not understand his present feelings,whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not; andtill that point were settled, she could not be quite herself.She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!  she mustconfess to herself that she was not wise yet.Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long hemeant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could notrecollect it.  He might be only passing through.  But it was moreprobable that he should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable asevery body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in alllikelihood see him somewhere.  Would she recollect him?  How would itall be?She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrovewas to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her something to encounterLady Russell's surprise; and now, if she were by any chance to bethrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge ofthe matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the firsthour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but atlast, in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him on theright hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view thegreater part of the street.  There were many other men about him, manygroups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.  Shelooked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of herrecognising him so soon as she did herself.  No, it was not to besupposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearlyopposite.  She looked at her however, from time to time, anxiously; andwhen the moment approached which must point him out, though not daringto look again (for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen),she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell's eyes being turnedexactly in the direction for him--of her being, in short, intentlyobserving him.  She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascinationhe must possess over Lady Russell's mind, the difficulty it must be forher to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment she must be feeling thateight or nine years should have passed over him, and in foreign climesand in active service too, without robbing him of one personal grace!At last, Lady Russell drew back her head.  ""Now, how would she speak ofhim?""""You will wonder,"" said she, ""what has been fixing my eye so long; butI was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and MrsFrankland were telling me of last night.  They described thedrawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of theway, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hungof any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I havebeen trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see nocurtains hereabouts that answer their description.""Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at herfriend or herself.  The part which provoked her most, was that in allthis waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the rightmoment for seeing whether he saw them.A day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or therooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough forthe Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegantstupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and moreengaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick ofknowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength wasnot tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.  It was aconcert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.  Ofcourse they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one, andCaptain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she could only have a fewminutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should besatisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all overcourage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him,Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by thesecircumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, withthe more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.  Mrs Smithgave a most good-humoured acquiescence.""By all means,"" said she; ""only tell me all about it, when you do come.Who is your party?""Anne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was leavingher said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, ""Well, Iheartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow ifyou can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have manymore visits from you.""Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment'ssuspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away."
Persuasion,20,"Chapter 20Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest of alltheir party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must bewaited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the OctagonRoom.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, andCaptain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was the nearest to him, andmaking yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.  He was preparingonly to bow and pass on, but her gentle ""How do you do?"" brought himout of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries inreturn, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the background.  Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knewnothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believedright to be done.While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabethcaught her ear.  She could not distinguish, but she must guess thesubject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, shecomprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him thatsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by aside glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.  This,though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better thannothing, and her spirits improved.After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, thatshe was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not; he seemed inno hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit, with a littlesmile, a little glow, he said--""I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you musthave suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpoweringyou at the time.""She assured him that she had not.""It was a frightful hour,"" said he, ""a frightful day!"" and he passedhis hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful,but in a moment, half smiling again, added, ""The day has produced someeffects however; has had some consequences which must be considered asthe very reverse of frightful.  When you had the presence of mind tosuggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon,you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those mostconcerned in her recovery.""""Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it wouldbe a very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles andgood temper.""""Yes,"" said he, looking not exactly forward; ""but there, I think, endsthe resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice overevery circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties tocontend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.  TheMusgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter'scomfort.  All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;more than perhaps--""He stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give himsome taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks and fixingher eyes on the ground.  After clearing his throat, however, heproceeded thus--""I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,and in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgroveas a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient inunderstanding, but Benwick is something more.  He is a clever man, areading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself toher with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude, had helearnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, itwould have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.  A man like him,in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!  FannyHarville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her wasindeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such a devotion of theheart to such a woman.  He ought not; he does not.""Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,or from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who, in spiteof the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and inspite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slamof the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, haddistinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, andbeginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in amoment.  It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject; and yet,after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not thesmallest wish for a total change, she only deviated so far as to say--""You were a good while at Lyme, I think?""""About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well wasquite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief tobe soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.  She would nothave been obstinate if I had not been weak.  The country round Lyme isvery fine.  I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, themore I found to admire.""""I should very much like to see Lyme again,"" said Anne.""Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found anythingin Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress you wereinvolved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!  I should havethought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.""""The last hours were certainly very painful,"" replied Anne; ""but whenpain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.  One doesnot love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has beenall suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case atLyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours,and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment.  So muchnovelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh placewould be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and inshort"" (with a faint blush at some recollections), ""altogether myimpressions of the place are very agreeable.""As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very partyappeared for whom they were waiting.  ""Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,""was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible withanxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meether.  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot andColonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,advanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was a group inwhich Anne found herself also necessarily included.  She was dividedfrom Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting, almost too interestingconversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penancecompared with the happiness which brought it on!  She had learnt, inthe last ten minutes, more of his feelings towards Louisa, more of allhis feelings than she dared to think of; and she gave herself up to thedemands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, withexquisite, though agitated sensations.  She was in good humour withall.  She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous andkind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself.The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping backfrom the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw thathe was gone.  She was just in time to see him turn into the ConcertRoom.  He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt a moment's regret.But ""they should meet again.  He would look for her, he would find herout before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was aswell to be asunder.  She was in need of a little interval forrecollection.""Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party wascollected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceedinto the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power,draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many peopleas they could.Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad backof the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wishfor which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be aninsult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison betweenit and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the otherall generous attachment.Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.  Herhappiness was from within.  Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed;but she knew nothing about it.  She was thinking only of the last halfhour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took a hasty rangeover it.  His choice of subjects, his expressions, and still more hismanner and look, had been such as she could see in only one light.  Hisopinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority, an opinion which he hadseemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelingsas to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could notfinish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance,all, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; thatanger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they weresucceeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tendernessof the past.  Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past.  She couldnot contemplate the change as implying less.  He must love her.These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied andflurried her too much to leave her any power of observation; and shepassed along the room without having a glimpse of him, without eventrying to discern him.  When their places were determined on, and theywere all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happento be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could notreach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for atime to be happy in a humbler way.The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Annewas among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat byher.  Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal objectof Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of theevening; it was just occupation enough:  she had feelings for thetender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patiencefor the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at leastduring the first act.  Towards the close of it, in the intervalsucceeding an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to MrElliot.  They had a concert bill between them.""This,"" said she, ""is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of thewords, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not betalked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do notpretend to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar.""""Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.  Youhave only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight theseinverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,comprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more ofyour ignorance.  Here is complete proof.""""I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to beexamined by a real proficient.""""I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,""replied he, ""without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I doregard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to beaware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished formodesty to be natural in any other woman.""""For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we areto have next,"" turning to the bill.""Perhaps,"" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, ""I have had a longeracquaintance with your character than you are aware of.""""Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since Icame to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in myown family.""""I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard youdescribed by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquaintedwith you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.""Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.  Noone can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been describedlong ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible;and Anne was all curiosity.  She wondered, and questioned him eagerly;but in vain.  He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell.""No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He would mention nonames now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.  He hadmany years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as hadinspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited thewarmest curiosity to know her.""Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality ofher many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth'sbrother.  He might have been in Mr Elliot's company, but she had notcourage to ask the question.""The name of Anne Elliot,"" said he, ""has long had an interesting soundto me.  Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if Idared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.""Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she received theirsound, than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behindher, which rendered every thing else trivial.  Her father and LadyDalrymple were speaking.""A well-looking man,"" said Sir Walter, ""a very well-looking man.""""A very fine young man indeed!"" said Lady Dalrymple.  ""More air thanone often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say.""""No, I just know his name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth; CaptainWentworth of the navy.  His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,the Croft, who rents Kellynch.""Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught theright direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among acluster of men at a little distance.  As her eyes fell on him, hisseemed to be withdrawn from her.  It had that appearance.  It seemed asif she had been one moment too late; and as long as she dared observe,he did not look again:  but the performance was recommencing, and shewas forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and lookstraight forward.When she could give another glance, he had moved away.  He could nothave come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:but she would rather have caught his eye.Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her.  She had no longer anyinclination to talk to him.  She wished him not so near her.The first act was over.  Now she hoped for some beneficial change; and,after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them diddecide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who did notchoose to move.  She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell; butshe had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean,whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink fromconversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him.He did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at adistance, but he never came.  The anxious interval wore awayunproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again, bencheswere reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or ofpenance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight orthe gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.  To Anne, itchiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.  She could not quitthat room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, withoutthe interchange of one friendly look.In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result ofwhich was favourable for her.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting downagain, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in amanner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some otherremovals, and a little scheming of her own,  Anne was enabled to placeherself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, muchmore within reach of a passer-by.  She could not do so, withoutcomparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; butstill she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by whatseemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her nextneighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before theconcert closed.Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when CaptainWentworth was again in sight.  She saw him not far off.  He saw hertoo; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slowdegrees came at last near enough to speak to her.  She felt thatsomething must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  Thedifference between his present air and what it had been in the OctagonRoom was strikingly great.  Why was it?  She thought of her father, ofLady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?  He beganby speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth ofUppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and inshort, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.  Annereplied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet inallowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenanceimproved, and he replied again with almost a smile.  They talked for afew minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards thebench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at thatmoment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.  It camefrom Mr Elliot.  He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, toexplain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have ageneral idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse; butnever had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; andwhen her own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she had donebefore, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reservedyet hurried sort of farewell.  ""He must wish her good night; he wasgoing; he should get home as fast as he could.""""Is not this song worth staying for?"" said Anne, suddenly struck by anidea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.""No!"" he replied impressively, ""there is nothing worth my staying for;""and he was gone directly.Jealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.  CaptainWentworth jealous of her affection!  Could she have believed it a weekago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.  How was suchjealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him?  How, in allthe peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would heever learn of her real sentiments?  It was misery to think of MrElliot's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable."
Persuasion,21,"Chapter 21Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going toMrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home at the time whenMr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliot wasalmost a first object.She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.  In spite of themischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard, perhapscompassion.  She could not help thinking much of the extraordinarycircumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which heseemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation, by his ownsentiments, by his early prepossession.  It was altogether veryextraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.  Howshe might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be theconclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her affection would behis for ever.  Their union, she believed, could not divide her morefrom other men, than their final separation.Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, couldnever have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sportingwith from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.  It was almost enough tospread purification and perfume all the way.She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed thismorning particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to haveexpected her, though it had been an appointment.An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne'srecollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate herfeatures and make her rejoice to talk of it.  All that she could tellshe told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had beenthere, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who hadalready heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Annecould relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of thecompany.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was wellknow by name to Mrs Smith.""The little Durands were there, I conclude,"" said she, ""with theirmouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to befed.  They never miss a concert.""""Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were inthe room.""""The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties, with thetall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.""""I do not know.  I do not think they were.""""Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her.  She never misses, Iknow; and you must have seen her.  She must have been in your owncircle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats ofgrandeur, round the orchestra, of course.""""No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to mein every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to befarther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing;I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little.""""Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.  Thereis a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and thisyou had.  You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothingbeyond.""""But I ought to have looked about me more,"" said Anne, conscious whileshe spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, thatthe object only had been deficient.""No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you had apleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see how the hourspassed:  that you had always something agreeable to listen to.  In theintervals of the concert it was conversation.""Anne half smiled and said, ""Do you see that in my eye?""""Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were incompany last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable inthe world, the person who interests you at this present time more thanall the rest of the world put together.""A blush overspread Anne's cheeks.  She could say nothing.""And such being the case,"" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, ""Ihope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming tome this morning.  It is really very good of you to come and sit withme, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.""Anne heard nothing of this.  She was still in the astonishment andconfusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine howany report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.  After anothershort silence--""Pray,"" said Mrs Smith, ""is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance withme?  Does he know that I am in Bath?""""Mr Elliot!"" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment'sreflection shewed her the mistake she had been under.  She caught itinstantaneously; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety,soon added, more composedly, ""Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?""""I have been a good deal acquainted with him,"" replied Mrs Smith,gravely, ""but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met.""""I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.  Had Iknown it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.""""To confess the truth,"" said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual air ofcheerfulness, ""that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.  I wantyou to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him.  Hecan be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it isdone.""""I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness tobe of even the slightest use to you,"" replied Anne; ""but I suspect thatyou are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greaterright to influence him, than is really the case.  I am sure you have,somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.  You must consider me only asMr Elliot's relation.  If in that light there is anything which yousuppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you would nothesitate to employ me.""Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--""I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.  Iought to have waited for official information.  But now, my dear MissElliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.Next week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it allsettled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot's good fortune.""""No,"" replied Anne, ""nor next week, nor next, nor next.  I assure youthat nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.  I should like to know why youimagine I am?""Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook herhead, and exclaimed--""Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew what youwere at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, whenthe right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know, we women nevermean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us, that every manis refused, till he offers.  But why should you be cruel?  Let me pleadfor my--present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend.Where can you look for a more suitable match?  Where could you expect amore gentlemanlike, agreeable man?  Let me recommend Mr Elliot.  I amsure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who canknow him better than Colonel Wallis?""""My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above halfa year.  He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to anyone.""""Oh! if these are your only objections,"" cried Mrs Smith, archly, ""MrElliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.  Donot forget me when you are married, that's all.  Let him know me to bea friend of yours, and then he will think little of the troublerequired, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairsand engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; verynatural, perhaps.  Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Ofcourse, he cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear MissElliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has senseto understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not beshipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters, andsafe in his character.  He will not be led astray; he will not bemisled by others to his ruin.""""No,"" said Anne, ""I can readily believe all that of my cousin.  Heseems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerousimpressions.  I consider him with great respect.  I have no reason,from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.But I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to beknown intimately soon.  Will not this manner of speaking of him, MrsSmith, convince you that he is nothing to me?  Surely this must be calmenough.  And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.  Should he everpropose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he has anythought of doing), I shall not accept him.  I assure you I shall not.I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have beensupposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford:not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--""She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;but less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardlyhave believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perceptionof there being a somebody else.  As it was, she instantly submitted,and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager toescape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should havefancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have received theidea, or from whom she could have heard it.""Do tell me how it first came into your head.""""It first came into my head,"" replied Mrs Smith, ""upon finding how muchyou were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in theworld to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and youmay depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you inthe same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.""""And has it indeed been spoken of?""""Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you calledyesterday?""""No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed no onein particular.""""It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a greatcuriosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it waswho told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.  She had had it from MrsWallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.  She sat an hour withme on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history."" ""The wholehistory,"" repeated Anne, laughing.  ""She could not make a very longhistory, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.""Mrs Smith said nothing.""But,"" continued Anne, presently, ""though there is no truth in myhaving this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be ofuse to you in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him your beingin Bath?  Shall I take any message?""""No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment, andunder a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured tointerest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you, Ihave nothing to trouble you with.""""I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?""""I did.""""Not before he was married, I suppose?""""Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.""""And--were you much acquainted?""""Intimately.""""Indeed!  Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.  I have agreat curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.  Was heat all such as he appears now?""""I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,"" was Mrs Smith's answer,given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.They were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--""I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,"" she cried, in her naturaltone of cordiality, ""I beg your pardon for the short answers I havebeen giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.  I havebeen doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.  Therewere many things to be taken into the account.  One hates to beofficious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.  Even thesmooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there maybe nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined; I think I amright; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot's realcharacter.  Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not thesmallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what mayhappen.  You might, some time or other, be differently affected towardshim.  Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced.  MrElliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his owninterest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery,that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character.  Hehas no feeling for others.  Those whom he has been the chief cause ofleading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallestcompunction.  He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment ofjustice or compassion.  Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!""Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, andin a calmer manner, she added,""My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angrywoman.  But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him.  Iwill only tell you what I have found him.  Facts shall speak.  He wasthe intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, andthought him as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed beforeour marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, becameexcessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinionof him.  At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; butMr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much moreagreeable than most others, and we were almost always together.  Wewere principally in town, living in very good style.  He was then theinferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers inthe Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearanceof a gentleman.  He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; hewas always welcome; he was like a brother.  My poor Charles, who hadthe finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided hislast farthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; Iknow that he often assisted him.""""This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,"" saidAnne, ""which has always excited my particular curiosity.  It must havebeen about the same time that he became known to my father and sister.I never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a somethingin his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, andafterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never couldquite reconcile with present times.  It seemed to announce a differentsort of man.""""I know it all, I know it all,"" cried Mrs Smith.  ""He had beenintroduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted withhim, but I heard him speak of them for ever.  I know he was invited andencouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to hismarriage, I knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the forsand againsts; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans;and though I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situationin society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all herlife afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of herlife, and can answer any question you may wish to put.""""Nay,"" said Anne, ""I have no particular enquiry to make about her.  Ihave always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should liketo know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father'sacquaintance as he did.  My father was certainly disposed to take verykind and proper notice of him.  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?""""Mr Elliot,"" replied Mrs Smith, ""at that period of his life, had oneobject in view:  to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker processthan the law.  He was determined to make it by marriage.  He wasdetermined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and Iknow it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannotdecide), that your father and sister, in their civilities andinvitations, were designing a match between the heir and the younglady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered hisideas of wealth and independence.  That was his motive for drawingback, I can assure you.  He told me the whole story.  He had noconcealments with me.  It was curious, that having just left you behindme in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should beyour cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing ofyour father and sister.  He described one Miss Elliot, and I thoughtvery affectionately of the other.""""Perhaps,"" cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, ""you sometimes spoke ofme to Mr Elliot?""""To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,and vouch for your being a very different creature from--""She checked herself just in time.""This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,"" criedAnne.  ""This explains it.  I found he had been used to hear of me.  Icould not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where dearself is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon; Ihave interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to hischaracter.""Mrs Smith hesitated a little here.  ""Oh! those things are too common.When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money is toocommon to strike one as it ought.  I was very young, and associatedonly with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without anystrict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.  I think differentlynow; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but atthat period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliotwas doing.  'To do the best for himself,' passed as a duty.""""But was not she a very low woman?""""Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.  Money, money, wasall that he wanted.  Her father was a grazier, her grandfather had beena butcher, but that was all nothing.  She was a fine woman, had had adecent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chanceinto Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him; and not adifficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to herbirth.  All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amountof her fortune, before he committed himself.  Depend upon it, whateveresteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a youngman he had not the smallest value for it.  His chance for the Kellynchestate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheapas dirt.  I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies weresaleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto,name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that Iused to hear him say on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yetyou ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and youshall have proof.""""Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,"" cried Anne.  ""You haveasserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be someyears ago.  This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used tohear and believe.  I am more curious to know why he should be sodifferent now.""""But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring forMary; stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness ofgoing yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid boxwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.""Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she wasdesired.  The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith,sighing over it as she unlocked it, said--""This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a smallportion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.  The letter Iam looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage,and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.  But he wascareless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and whenI came to examine his papers, I found it with others still moretrivial, from different people scattered here and there, while manyletters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.  Here itis; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfiedwith Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of formerintimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad that I can produceit.""This was the letter, directed to ""Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,""and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:--""Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowersme.  I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but Ihave lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none likeit.  At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being incash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.  Theyare gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them thissummer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tellme how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.  The baronet,nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough.If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decentequivalent  for the reversion.  He is worse than last year.""I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name ofWalter I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult mewith my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be onlyyours truly,--Wm. Elliot.""Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and MrsSmith, observing the high colour in her face, said--""The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgotthe exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.But it shows you the man.  Mark his professions to my poor husband.Can any thing be stronger?""Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification offinding such words applied to her father.  She was obliged to recollectthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, thatno one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that noprivate correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she couldrecover calmness enough to return the letter which she had beenmeditating over, and say--""Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing youwere saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?""""I can explain this too,"" cried Mrs Smith, smiling.""Can you really?""""Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and Iwill shew him as he is now.  I cannot produce written proof again, butI can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he isnow wanting, and what he is now doing.  He is no hypocrite now.  Hetruly wants to marry you.  His present attentions to your family arevery sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority: hisfriend Colonel Wallis.""""Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?""""No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; ittakes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream is as goodas at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easilymoved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of hisviews on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, asensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis hasa very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had betternot, and he repeats it all to her.  She in the overflowing spirits ofher recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse  knowing myacquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me.  On Mondayevening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets ofMarlborough Buildings.  When I talked of a whole history, therefore,you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.""""My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.  MrElliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for theefforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.  That was allprior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on the most friendly termswhen I arrived.""""I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--""""Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in sucha line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of somany, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, canhardly have much truth left.""""Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of the generalcredit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourselfimmediately contradict or confirm.  Nobody supposes that you were hisfirst inducement.  He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, andadmired you, but without knowing it to be you.  So says my historian,at least.  Is this true?  Did he see you last summer or autumn,'somewhere down in the west,' to use her own words, without knowing itto be you?""""He certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.  I happened to beat Lyme.""""Well,"" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, ""grant my friend the creditdue to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He saw you thenat Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meetwith you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from thatmoment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.  Butthere was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.  If thereis anything in my story which you know to be either false orimprobable, stop me.  My account states, that your sister's friend, thelady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bathwith Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short whenthey first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since;that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible,and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea,among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, andas general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind tothe danger.""Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and shecontinued--""This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye uponyour father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visitin Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest inwatching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bathfor a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, andthe reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand, that timehad worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to thevalue of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion he is acompletely altered man.  Having long had as much money as he couldspend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he hasbeen gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he isheir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but itis now a confirmed feeling.  He cannot bear the idea of not being SirWilliam.  You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from hisfriend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced;the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and offixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his formeracquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might givehim the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and ofcircumventing the lady if he found it material.  This was agreed uponbetween the two friends as the only thing to be done; and ColonelWallis was to assist in every way that he could.  He was to beintroduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was tobe introduced.  Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application wasforgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there itwas his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival addedanother motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.  He omitted noopportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called atall hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.  You canimagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, mayrecollect what you have seen him do.""""Yes,"" said Anne, ""you tell me nothing which does not accord with whatI have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive inthe details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicitymust ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprisesme.  I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of MrElliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have neverbeen satisfied.  I have always wanted some other motive for his conductthan appeared.  I should like to know his present opinion, as to theprobability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considersthe danger to be lessening or not.""""Lessening, I understand,"" replied Mrs Smith.  ""He thinks Mrs Clayafraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring toproceed as she might do in his absence.  But since he must be absentsome time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure whileshe holds her present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, asnurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles whenyou and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.  Ascheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but mysensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  'Why, to be sure,ma'am,' said she, 'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is avery strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.  She mustbe allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since selfwill intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions ofattending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?""""I am very glad to know all this,"" said Anne, after a littlethoughtfulness.  ""It will be more painful to me in some respects to bein company with him, but I shall know better what to do.  My line ofconduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous,artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle toguide him than selfishness.""But Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away fromher first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her ownfamily concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; buther attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints,and she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justifythe unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him to have been veryunfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justiceand compassion.She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by MrElliot's marriage) they had been as before always together, and MrElliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.  MrsSmith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender ofthrowing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their incomehad never been equal to their style of living, and that from the firstthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.  Fromhis wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a manof warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strongunderstanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,led by him, and probably despised by him.  Mr Elliot, raised by hismarriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification ofpleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), andbeginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself tobe poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend'sprobable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting andencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smithsaccordingly had been ruined.The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge ofit.  They had previously known embarrassments enough to try thefriendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had betternot be tried; but it was not till his death that the wretched state ofhis affairs was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith hadappointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had beensuch as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened towithout corresponding indignation.Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgentapplications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same sternresolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a coldcivility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils itmight bring on her.  It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude andinhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crimecould have been worse.  She had a great deal to listen to; all theparticulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upondistress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, weredwelt on now with a natural indulgence.  Anne could perfectlycomprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined towonder at the composure of her friend's usual state of mind.There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances ofparticular irritation.  She had good reason to believe that someproperty of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for manyyears under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its ownincumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and thisproperty, though not large, would be enough to make her comparativelyrich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.  Mr Elliot would do nothing,and she could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personalexertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others byher want of money.  She had no natural connexions to assist her evenwith their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistanceof the law.  This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a littletrouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might beeven weakening her claims, was hard to bear.It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good officeswith Mr Elliot.  She had previously, in the anticipation of theirmarriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but onbeing assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, sincehe did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, thatsomething might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman heloved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face ofeverything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope ofsucceeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least thecomfort of telling the whole story her own way.After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could notbut express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him sofavourably in the beginning of their conversation.  ""She had seemed torecommend and praise him!""""My dear,"" was Mrs Smith's reply, ""there was nothing else to be done.I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet havemade the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if hehad been your husband.  My heart bled for you, as I talked ofhappiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such awoman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.  He was very unkind tohis first wife.  They were wretched together.  But she was too ignorantand giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.  I was willing tohope that you must fare better.""Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of havingbeen induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of themisery which must have followed.  It was just possible that she mighthave been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such a supposition,which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, toolate?It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, thatAnne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relativeto Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved."
Persuasion,22,"Chapter 22Anne went home to think over all that she had heard.  In one point, herfeelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.  There was nolonger anything of tenderness due to him.  He stood as opposed toCaptain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evilof his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he might havedone, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.  Pityfor him was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.  In everyother respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she sawmore to distrust and to apprehend.  She was concerned for thedisappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for themortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister, andhad all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how toavert any one of them.  She was most thankful for her own knowledge ofhim.  She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for notslighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeedspringing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no oneelse could have done.  Could the knowledge have been extended throughher family?  But this was a vain idea.  She must talk to Lady Russell,tell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the eventwith as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want ofcomposure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not beopened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which mustbe all to herself.She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escapedseeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morningvisit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, whenshe heard that he was coming again in the evening.""I had not the smallest intention of asking him,"" said Elizabeth, withaffected carelessness, ""but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, atleast.""""Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder foran invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him; for yourhard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.""""Oh!"" cried Elizabeth, ""I have been rather too much used to the game tobe soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found howexcessively he was regretting that he should miss my father thismorning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit anopportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together.  They appear to somuch advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving sopleasantly.  Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.""""Quite delightful!"" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn hereyes towards Anne.  ""Exactly like father and son!  Dear Miss Elliot,may I not say father and son?""""Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.  If you will have suchideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentionsbeing beyond those of other men.""""My dear Miss Elliot!"" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.""Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.  I didinvite him, you know.  I sent him away with smiles.  When I found hewas really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole dayto-morrow, I had compassion on him.""Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew suchpleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival ofthe very person whose presence must really be interfering with herprime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sightof Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look,and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devotingherself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have doneotherwise.To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter theroom; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.  She hadbeen used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, butnow she saw insincerity in everything.  His attentive deference to herfather, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when shethought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she could hardly bearthe sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of hisartificial good sentiments.She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke aremonstrance on his side.  It was a great object to her to escape allenquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool tohim as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, asquietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she hadbeen gradually led along.  She was accordingly more guarded, and morecool, than she had been the night before.He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he couldhave heard her formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified bymore solicitation; but the charm was broken: he found that the heat andanimation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin'svanity; he found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any ofthose attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims ofthe others.  He little surmised that it was a subject acting nowexactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts allthose parts of his conduct which were least excusable.She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out ofBath the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone thegreater part of two days.  He was invited again to Camden Place thevery evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening hisabsence was certain.  It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should bealways before her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to theirparty, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.  Itwas so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised onher father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources ofmortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay's selfishness was not socomplicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded forthe marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot'ssubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell, andaccomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gonedirectly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out on someobliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which determined her towait till she might be safe from such a companion.  She saw Mrs Clayfairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morningin Rivers Street.""Very well,"" said Elizabeth, ""I have nothing to send but my love.  Oh!you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, andpretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself forever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.  You need nottell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.  I usedto think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at theconcert.  Something so formal and arrange in her air!  and she sits soupright!  My best love, of course.""""And mine,"" added Sir Walter.  ""Kindest regards.  And you may say, thatI mean to call upon her soon.  Make a civil message; but I shall onlyleave my card.  Morning visits are never fair by women at her time oflife, who make themselves up so little.  If she would only wear rougeshe would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, Iobserved the blinds were let down immediately.""While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could itbe?  Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of MrElliot, would have expected him, but for his known engagement sevenmiles off.  After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds ofapproach were heard, and ""Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove"" were usheredinto the room.Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Annewas really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but thatthey could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it becameclear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with anyviews of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth wereable to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.  Theywere come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at theWhite Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walterand Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, andregaling themselves with her admiration, Anne could not draw uponCharles's brain for a regular history of their coming, or anexplanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which hadbeen ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparentconfusion as to whom their party consisted of.She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta, andCaptain Harville, beside their two selves.  He gave her a very plain,intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a greatdeal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme had received itsfirst impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to come to Bath onbusiness.  He had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doingsomething, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him,and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as anadvantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and hadmade herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everythingseemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then, it had been taken upby his father and mother.  His mother had some old friends in Bath whomshe wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta tocome and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short,it ended in being his mother's party, that everything might becomfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were includedin it by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the nightbefore.  Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained withMr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enoughfor Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She had imagined suchdifficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriagefrom being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that, veryrecently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter hadbeen applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could notpossibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of hispresent income, with almost a certainty of something more permanentlong before the term in question, the two families had consented to theyoung people's wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take placein a few months, quite as soon as Louisa's.  ""And a very good living itwas,"" Charles added:  ""only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, andin a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire.  In the centre ofsome of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three greatproprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to twoof the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a specialrecommendation.  Not that he will value it as he ought,"" he observed,""Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him.""""I am extremely glad, indeed,"" cried Anne, ""particularly glad that thisshould happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well,and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect ofone should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be soequal in their prosperity and comfort.  I hope your father and motherare quite happy with regard to both.""""Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen werericher, but he has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, comingdown with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeableoperation, and it streightens him as to many things.  However, I do notmean to say they have not a right to it.  It is very fit they shouldhave daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,liberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.She never did, you know.  But she does not do him justice, nor thinkenough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her attend to the value of theproperty.  It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have likedCharles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.""""Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,"" exclaimed Anne,""should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything toconfer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people to be insuch hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free from all thoseambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery,both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa perfectly recoverednow?""He answered rather hesitatingly, ""Yes, I believe I do; very muchrecovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, nolaughing or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only toshut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a youngdab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses,or whispering to her, all day long.""Anne could not help laughing.  ""That cannot be much to your taste, Iknow,"" said she; ""but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.""""To be sure he is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I amso illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects andpleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when onecan but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.  His reading has donehim no harm, for he has fought as well as read.  He is a brave fellow.I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.  Wehad a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's greatbarns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the betterever since.""Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles'sfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heardenough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice inits happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had noneof the ill-will of envy in it.  She would certainly have risen to theirblessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs.The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was inexcellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so wellsatisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage with fourhorses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, thatshe was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, andenter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as theywere detailed to her.  She had no demands on her father or sister, andher consequence was just enough increased by their handsomedrawing-rooms.Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.  She felt thatMrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them; butshe could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction ofservants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had beenalways so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.  It was a strugglebetween propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and thenElizabeth was happy again.  These were her internal persuasions: ""Oldfashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to givedinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not evenask her own sister's family, though they were here a month: and I daresay it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her quite out ofher way.  I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easywith us.  I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better;that will be a novelty and a treat.  They have not seen two suchdrawing rooms before.  They will be delighted to come to-morrowevening.  It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.""  Andthis satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation was given to the twopresent, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied.She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to LadyDalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged tocome; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention.Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in thecourse of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to goand see her and Henrietta directly.Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; butAnne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communicationcould be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, tosee again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with aneagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves, andAnne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly in thatstate of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which madeher full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked beforeat all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by herusefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness, and awarmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sadwant of such blessings at home.  She was entreated to give them as muchof her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, orrather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturallyfell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and onCharles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove'shistory of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions onbusiness, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every helpwhich Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying toconvince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, wellamused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking theentrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining.A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party inan hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutesbrought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half anhour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than halffilled:  a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove,and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.  Theappearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of themoment.  It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that thisarrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them togetheragain.  Their last meeting had been most important in opening hisfeelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but shefeared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which hadhastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.  He did notseem to want to be near enough for conversation.She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and triedto dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--""Surely, ifthere be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understandeach other ere long.  We are not boy and girl, to be captiouslyirritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence, and wantonly playingwith our own happiness.""  And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she feltas if their being in company with each other, under their presentcircumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies andmisconstructions of the most mischievous kind.""Anne,"" cried Mary, still at her window, ""there is Mrs Clay, I am sure,standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.  I saw themturn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed deep in talk.Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.  It is MrElliot himself.""""No,"" cried Anne, quickly, ""it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.  Hewas to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back tillto-morrow.""As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her, theconsciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regretthat she had said so much, simple as it was.Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,began talking very warmly about the family features, and protestingstill more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne tocome and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried tobe cool and unconcerned.  Her distress returned, however, on perceivingsmiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the ladyvisitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret.  It wasevident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pausesucceeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.""Do come, Anne,"" cried Mary, ""come and look yourself.  You will be toolate if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shakinghands.  He is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem tohave forgot all about Lyme.""To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Anne did movequietly to the window.  She was just in time to ascertain that itreally was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed, before hedisappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other;and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such anappearance of friendly conference between two persons of totallyopposite interest, she calmly said, ""Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly.He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may bemistaken, I might not attend;"" and walked back to her chair,recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herselfwell.The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen themoff, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, beganwith--""Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.  Ihave been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.  A'n'tI a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.It holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will not besorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.  Have not I donewell, mother?""Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfectreadiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, whenMary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--""Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?  Take a boxfor to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged to CamdenPlace to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meetLady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principalfamily connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?  How can you beso forgetful?""""Phoo! phoo!"" replied Charles, ""what's an evening party?  Never worthremembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if hehad wanted to see us.  You may do as you like, but I shall go to theplay.""""Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when youpromised to go.""""No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word'happy.'  There was no promise.""""But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.  We wereasked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always such a greatconnexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.  Nothing ever happenedon either side that was not announced immediately.  We are quite nearrelations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularlyto be acquainted with!  Every attention is due to Mr Elliot.  Consider,my father's heir:  the future representative of the family.""""Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives,"" cried Charles.  ""Iam not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the risingsun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think itscandalous to go for the sake of his heir.  What is Mr Elliot to me?""The careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that CaptainWentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul;and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles toherself.Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half seriousand half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to makeit known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, sheshould not think herself very well used, if they went to the playwithout her.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.""We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back andchange the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided, and weshould be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,if Miss Anne could not be with us.""Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much sofor the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--""If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.  Ihave no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy tochange it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better not beattempted, perhaps.""  She had spoken it; but she trembled when it wasdone, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even totry to observe their effect.It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charlesonly reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persistingthat he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place; probablyfor the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking astation, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.""You have not been long enough in Bath,"" said he, ""to enjoy the eveningparties of the place.""""Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.  I am nocard-player.""""You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards; buttime makes many changes.""""I am not yet so much changed,"" cried Anne, and stopped, fearing shehardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments he said,and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, ""It is a period,indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period.""Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imaginationto ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds hehad uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager tomake use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on hercompanions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in.They were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready, andtried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known theregret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparingto quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations forher cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pityher.Their preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds wereheard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for SirWalter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptomsof the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room wasover, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk,to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.  Howmortifying to feel that it was so!Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth wasacknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequelexplained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying the propernothings, she began to give the invitation which was to comprise allthe remaining dues of the Musgroves.  ""To-morrow evening, to meet a fewfriends:  no formal party."" It was all said very gracefully, and thecards with which she had provided herself, the ""Miss Elliot at home,""were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all,and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  Thetruth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understandthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.  The pastwas nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth would move aboutwell in her drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walterand Elizabeth arose and disappeared.The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animationreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but notto Anne.  She could think only of the invitation she had with suchastonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had beenreceived; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather thangratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.  Sheknew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believethat he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement forall the insolence of the past.  Her spirits sank.  He held the card inhis hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.""Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!"" whispered Mary veryaudibly.  ""I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!  You see hecannot put the card out of his hand.""Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itselfinto a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that shemight neither see nor hear more to vex her.The party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladiesproceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Annebelonged to them.  She was earnestly begged to return and dine, andgive them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so longexerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only forhome, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose.Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning,therefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk toCamden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to thebusy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, thefrequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continuallyimproving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it themost completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herselfwith the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would comeor not?  They were reckoning him as certain, but with her it was agnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.  Shegenerally thought he would come, because she generally thought heought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positiveact of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions ofvery opposite feelings.She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hoursafter his being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vainfor some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, shedetermined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in MrsClay's face as she listened.  It was transient: cleared away in aninstant; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness ofhaving, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearingauthority of his, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) tohis lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter.  Sheexclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:--""Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise Imet with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.  Heturned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He had been preventedsetting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in ahurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his beingdetermined not to be delayed in his return.  He wanted to know howearly he might be admitted to-morrow.  He was full of 'to-morrow,' andit is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since Ientered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all thathad happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out ofmy head."""
Persuasion,23,"Chapter 23One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith; but akeener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by MrElliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it becamea matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatoryvisit in Rivers Street.  She had promised to be with the Musgroves frombreakfast to dinner.  Her faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot'scharacter, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head, must live anotherday.She could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather wasunfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her friends'account, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able toattempt the walk.  When she reached the White Hart, and made her way tothe proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time,nor the first to arrive.  The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove,talking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; andshe immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait,had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon,and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove tokeep her there till they returned.  She had only to submit, sit down,be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all theagitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a littlebefore the morning closed.  There was no delay, no waste of time.  Shewas deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of suchhappiness, instantly.  Two minutes after her entering the room, CaptainWentworth said--""We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if youwill give me materials.""Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it, and nearlyturning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter'sengagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which wasperfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.  Anne felt thatshe did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harvilleseemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearingmany undesirable particulars; such as, ""how Mr Musgrove and my brotherHayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayterhad said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and whathad occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwardspersuaded to think might do very well,"" and a great deal in the samestyle of open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with everyadvantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could notgive, could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croftwas attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, itwas very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too muchself-occupied to hear.""And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,"" said Mrs Musgrove, in herpowerful whisper, ""though we could have wished it different, yet,altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, forCharles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty nearas bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make thebest of it, as many others have done before them.  At any rate, said I,it will be better than a long engagement.""""That is precisely what I was going to observe,"" cried Mrs Croft.  ""Iwould rather have young people settle on a small income at once, andhave to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved ina long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--""""Oh! dear Mrs Croft,"" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her finish herspeech, ""there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a longengagement.  It is what I always protested against for my children.  Itis all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, ifthere is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, oreven in twelve; but a long engagement--""""Yes, dear ma'am,"" said Mrs Croft, ""or an uncertain engagement, anengagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing that at such atime there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe andunwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.""Anne found an unexpected interest here.  She felt its application toherself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the samemoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, onequick, conscious look at her.The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrarypractice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothingdistinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was inconfusion.Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now lefthis seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him, thoughit was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that hewas inviting her to join him where he stood.  He looked at her with asmile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, ""Come to me, Ihave something to say;"" and the unaffected, easy kindness of mannerwhich denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was,strongly enforced the invitation.  She roused herself and went to him.The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room fromwhere the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to CaptainWentworth's table, not very near.  As she joined him, CaptainHarville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expressionwhich seemed its natural character.""Look here,"" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying asmall miniature painting, ""do you know who that is?""""Certainly:  Captain Benwick.""""Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,"" (in a deep tone,) ""it wasnot done for her.  Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together atLyme, and grieving for him?  I little thought then--but no matter.This was drawn at the Cape.  He met with a clever young German artistat the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat tohim, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge ofgetting it properly set for another!  It was a commission to me!  Butwho else was there to employ?  I hope I can allow for him.  I am notsorry, indeed, to make it over to another.  He undertakes it;"" (lookingtowards Captain Wentworth,) ""he is writing about it now.""  And with aquivering lip he wound up the whole by adding, ""Poor Fanny! she wouldnot have forgotten him so soon!""""No,"" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. ""That I can easilybelieve.""""It was not in her nature.  She doted on him.""""It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.""Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, ""Do you claim that for yoursex?"" and she answered the question, smiling also, ""Yes.  We certainlydo not forget you as soon as you forget us.  It is, perhaps, our faterather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.  We live at home,quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.  You are forced onexertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits, business of somesort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, andcontinual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.""""Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply toBenwick.  He has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace turnedhim on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in ourlittle family circle, ever since.""""True,"" said Anne, ""very true; I did not recollect; but what shall wesay now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from outwardcircumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man's nature,which has done the business for Captain Benwick.""""No, no, it is not man's nature.  I will not allow it to be more man'snature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, orhave loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogybetween our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies arethe strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most roughusage, and riding out the heaviest weather.""""Your feelings may be the strongest,"" replied Anne, ""but the samespirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the mosttender.  Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.  You havedifficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.  Youare always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.Your home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,nor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed"" (with afaltering voice), ""if woman's feelings were to be added to all this.""""We shall never agree upon this question,"" Captain Harville wasbeginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to CaptainWentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.  It wasnothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was startledat finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined tosuspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied bythem, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he couldhave caught.""Have you finished your letter?"" said Captain Harville.""Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes.""""There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.  I amin very good anchorage here,"" (smiling at Anne,) ""well supplied, andwant for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,""(lowering his voice,) ""as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose,upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.  But let meobserve that all histories are against you--all stories, prose andverse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fiftyquotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think Iever opened a book in my life which had not something to say uponwoman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman'sfickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.""""Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples inbooks.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has beenin their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything.""""But how shall we prove anything?""""We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such apoint.  It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; andupon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which hasoccurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhapsthose very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such ascannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in somerespect saying what should not be said.""""Ah!"" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, ""if I couldbut make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look athis wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them offin, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, 'God knowswhether we ever meet again!' And then, if I could convey to you theglow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after atwelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port,he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending todeceive himself, and saying, 'They cannot be here till such a day,' butall the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing themarrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours soonerstill!  If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bearand do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of hisexistence!  I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!""pressing his own with emotion.""Oh!"" cried Anne eagerly, ""I hope I do justice to all that is felt byyou, and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I shouldundervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of myfellow-creatures!  I should deserve utter contempt if I dared tosuppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your marriedlives.  I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to everydomestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed theexpression--so long as you have an object.  I mean while the woman youlove lives, and lives for you.  All the privilege I claim for my ownsex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that ofloving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.""She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart wastoo full, her breath too much oppressed.""You are a good soul,"" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand on herarm, quite affectionately.  ""There is no quarrelling with you.  Andwhen I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.""Their attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was takingleave.""Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,"" said she.  ""I amgoing home, and you have an engagement with your friend.  To-night wemay have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,"" (turning toAnne.)  ""We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understoodFrederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you aredisengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?""Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and eithercould not or would not answer fully.""Yes,"" said he, ""very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shallsoon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half aminute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.  I shall be at yourservice in half a minute.""Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letterwith great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitatedair, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how tounderstand it.  She had the kindest ""Good morning, God bless you!"" fromCaptain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!  He had passedout of the room without a look!She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he hadbeen writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, itwas himself.  He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves,and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out aletter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyesof glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting hisgloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was awareof his being in it: the work of an instant!The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyondexpression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to ""Miss A.E.--,"" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily.While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he had been alsoaddressing her!  On the contents of that letter depended all which thisworld could do for her.  Anything was possible, anything might bedefied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements ofher own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, andsinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the veryspot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the followingwords:""I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such meansas are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony, halfhope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings aregone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart even more yourown than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.  Darenot say that man forgets sooner than  woman, that his love has anearlier death.  I have loved none but you.  Unjust I may have been,weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.  You alone havebrought me to Bath.  For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you notseen this?  Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had notwaited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I thinkyou must have penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instanthearing something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I candistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.Too good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.  You dobelieve that there is true attachment and constancy among men.  Believeit to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.""I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or followyour party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look, will be enough todecide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never.""Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half an hour'ssolitude and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the tenminutes only which now passed before she was interrupted, with all therestraints of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.Every moment rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpoweringhappiness.  And before she was beyond the first stage of fullsensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then animmediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.  She begannot to understand a word they said, and was obliged to pleadindisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see that she lookedvery ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without herfor the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only have gone away, andleft her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been hercure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her wasdistracting, and in desperation, she said she would go home.""By all means, my dear,"" cried Mrs Musgrove, ""go home directly, andtake care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.  I wishSarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.  Charles, ringand order a chair.  She must not walk.""But the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibilityof speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meetinghim) could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, havingassured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in thecase; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blowon her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall;could part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better atnight.Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--""I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.  Pray be sogood as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see yourwhole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been some mistake; andI wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and CaptainWentworth, that we hope to see them both.""""Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.  CaptainHarville has no thought but of going.""""Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?  You willsee them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me.""""To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see CaptainHarville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.  But indeed,my dear, you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quiteengaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I daresay.""Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to dampthe perfection of her felicity.  It could not be very lasting, however.Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in herpower to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.  Anothermomentary vexation occurred.  Charles, in his real concern and goodnature, would go home with her; there was no preventing him.  This wasalmost cruel.  But she could not be long ungrateful; he was sacrificingan engagement at a gunsmith's, to be of use to her; and she set offwith him, with no feeling but gratitude apparent.They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something offamiliar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight ofCaptain Wentworth.  He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether tojoin or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.  Anne could commandherself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively.  The cheekswhich had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitatedwere decided.  He walked by her side.  Presently, struck by a suddenthought, Charles said--""Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street, orfarther up the town?""""I hardly know,"" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.""Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take myplace, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.  She is rather donefor this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought tobe at that fellow's in the Market Place.  He promised me the sight of acapital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep itunpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I donot turn back now, I have no chance.  By his description, a good deallike the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one dayround Winthrop.""There could not be an objection.  There could be only the most properalacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reinedin and spirits dancing in private rapture.  In half a minute Charleswas at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceedingtogether:  and soon words enough had passed between them to decidetheir direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravelwalk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour ablessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which thehappiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow.  Therethey exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had oncebefore seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by somany, many years of division and estrangement.  There they returnedagain into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in theirre-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, moretried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, andattachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, asthey slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group aroundthem, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge inthose retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in thoseexplanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, whichwere so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the littlevariations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday andtoday there could scarcely be an end.She had not mistaken him.  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retardingweight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate in the veryhour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned, after a shortsuspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him ineverything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the lastfour-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding to the betterhopes which her looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; ithad been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones whichhad reached him while she talked with Captain Harville; and under theirresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper, andpoured out his feelings.Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.He persisted in having loved none but her.  She had never beensupplanted.  He never even believed himself to see her equal.  Thusmuch indeed he was obliged to acknowledge:  that he had been constantunconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her,and believed it to be done.  He had imagined himself indifferent, whenhe had only been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, becausehe had been a sufferer from them.  Her character was now fixed on hismind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium offortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that onlyat Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had hebegun to understand himself.  At Lyme, he had received lessons of morethan one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least rousedhim, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville's had fixed hersuperiority.In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (theattempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it tobe impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Louisa;though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followedit, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with whichLouisa's could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled holdit possessed over his own.  There, he had learnt to distinguish betweenthe steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between thedarings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.  Therehe had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he hadlost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness ofresentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown inhis way.From that period his penance had become severe.  He had no sooner beenfree from the horror and remorse attending the first few days ofLouisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than hehad begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.""I found,"" said he, ""that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutualattachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree, I couldcontradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that othersmight have felt the same--her own family, nay, perhaps herself--I wasno longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour if she wished it.I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously on this subjectbefore.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have itsdanger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to betrying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at therisk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other illeffects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.""He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and thatprecisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa atall, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for himwere what the Harvilles supposed.  It determined him to leave Lyme, andawait her complete recovery elsewhere.  He would gladly weaken, by anyfair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him mightexist; and he went, therefore, to his brother's, meaning after a whileto return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.""I was six weeks with Edward,"" said he, ""and saw him happy.  I couldhave no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He enquired after you veryparticularly; asked even if you were personally altered, littlesuspecting that to my eye you could never alter.""Anne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder for areproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured, in hereight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlieryouth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased toAnne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be theresult, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his ownpride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once releasedfrom Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of herengagement with Benwick.""Here,"" said he, ""ended the worst of my state; for now I could at leastput myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could dosomething.  But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only forevil, had been dreadful.  Within the first five minutes I said, 'I willbe at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was.  Was it unpardonable to think itworth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope?  Youwere single.  It was possible that you might retain the feelings of thepast, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine.  I couldnever doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew toa certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of betterpretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, 'Was thisfor me?'""Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but theconcert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up of exquisitemoments.  The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room tospeak to him:  the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing and tearing heraway, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope orincreasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy.""To see you,"" cried he, ""in the midst of those who could not be mywell-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope toinfluence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant orindifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his!  Was itnot enough to make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I lookon without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behindyou, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of herinfluence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion hadonce done--was it not all against me?""""You should have distinguished,"" replied Anne.  ""You should not havesuspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was topersuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.  When I yielded,I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here.  Inmarrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred,and all duty violated.""""Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,"" he replied, ""but I could not.I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired ofyour character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting underyear after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded, whohad given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year ofmisery.  I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.  Theforce of habit was to be added.""""I should have thought,"" said Anne, ""that my manner to yourself mighthave spared you much or all of this.""""No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement toanother man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet, I wasdetermined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning, andI felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.""At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that housecould have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every otherpainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, shere-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in somemomentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.  An intervalof meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective ofeverything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went to herroom, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of herenjoyment.The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the companyassembled.  It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those whohad never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplacebusiness, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Annehad never found an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibilityand happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about orcared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creaturearound her.  Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrympleand Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.  Shecared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the publicmanners of her father and sister.  With the Musgroves, there was thehappy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-heartedintercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts atconversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiraland Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest,which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with CaptainWentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, andalways the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there.It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied inadmiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--""I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge ofthe right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believethat I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectlyright in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than youdo now.  To me, she was in the place of a parent.  Do not mistake me,however.  I am not saying that she did not err in her advice.  It was,perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as theevent decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in anycircumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean,that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had doneotherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagementthan I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in myconscience.  I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable inhuman nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, astrong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion.""He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,replied, as if in cool deliberation--""Not yet.  But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.  I trustto being in charity with her soon.  But I too have been thinking overthe past, and a  question has suggested itself, whether there may nothave been one person more my enemy even than that lady?  My own self.Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a fewthousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then writtento you, would you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short, haverenewed the engagement then?""""Would I!"" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.""Good God!"" he cried, ""you would!  It is not that I did not think ofit, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but Iwas proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.  I shutmy eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.  This is arecollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner thanmyself.  Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.  I have been used to thegratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that Ienjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.Like other great men under reverses,"" he added, with a smile. ""I mustendeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.  I must learn to brook beinghappier than I deserve."""
Persuasion,24,"Chapter 24Who can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people takeit into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance tocarry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or everso little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to betruth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth andan Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousnessof right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearingdown every opposition?  They might in fact, have borne down a greatdeal more than they met with, for there was little to distress thembeyond the want of graciousness and warmth.  Sir Walter made noobjection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold andunconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds,and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him,was no longer nobody.  He was now esteemed quite worthy to address thedaughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principleor sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in whichProvidence had placed him, and who could give his daughter at presentbut a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hershereafter.Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanityflattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far fromthinking it a bad match for her.  On the contrary, when he saw more ofCaptain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well,he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that hissuperiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against hersuperiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name,enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace,for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite anyserious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell must besuffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot, andbe making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and dojustice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what Lady Russell hadnow to do.  She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken withregard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances ineach; that because Captain Wentworth's manners had not suited her ownideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate acharacter of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot'smanners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness,their general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick inreceiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions andwell-regulated mind.  There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do,than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take upa new set of opinions and of hopes.There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernmentof character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience inothers can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part ofunderstanding than her young friend.  But she was a very good woman,and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her firstwas to see Anne happy.  She loved Anne better than she loved her ownabilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, foundlittle hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who wassecuring the happiness of her other child.Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratifiedby the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married, andshe might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to theconnexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her ownsister must be better than her husband's sisters, it was very agreeablethat Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either CaptainBenwick or Charles Hayter.  She had something to suffer, perhaps, whenthey came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights ofseniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had afuture to look forward to, of powerful consolation.  Anne had noUppercross Hall before her, no landed estate, no headship of a family;and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet,she would not change situations with Anne.It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfiedwith her situation, for a change is not very probable there.  She hadsoon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one ofproper condition has since presented himself to raise even theunfounded hopes which sunk with him.The news of his cousin Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot mostunexpectedly.  It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness, hisbest hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which ason-in-law's rights would have given.  But, though discomfited anddisappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and hisown enjoyment.  He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's quitting itsoon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under hisprotection in London, it was evident how double a game he had beenplaying, and how determined he was to save himself from being cut outby one artful woman, at least.Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she hadsacrificed, for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheminglonger for Sir Walter.  She has abilities, however, as well asaffections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, orhers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her frombeing the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed atlast into making her the wife of Sir William.It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked andmortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of theirdeception in her.  They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resortto for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and followothers, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state ofhalf enjoyment.Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning tolove Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy to thehappiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness ofhaving no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.There she felt her own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion intheir fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret; butto have no family to receive and estimate him properly, nothing ofrespectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all theworth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers andsisters, was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well besensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity.  She hadbut two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and MrsSmith.  To those, however, he was very well disposed to attach himself.Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could nowvalue from his heart.  While he was not obliged to say that he believedher to have been right in originally dividing them, he was ready to sayalmost everything else in her favour, and as for Mrs Smith, she hadclaims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently.Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, andtheir marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend, secured hertwo.  She was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and CaptainWentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering her husband'sproperty in the West Indies, by writing for her, acting for her, andseeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with theactivity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fullyrequited the services which she had rendered, or ever meant to render,to his wife.Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends tobe often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not failher; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might havebid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.  Shemight have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet behappy.  Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits, as herfriend Anne's was in the warmth of her heart.  Anne was tendernessitself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth'saffection.  His profession was all that could ever make her friendswish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dimher sunshine.  She gloried in being a sailor's wife, but she must paythe tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, ifpossible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in itsnational importance.Finis"
